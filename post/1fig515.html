</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Bryce Young was chosen number 1 in the 2023 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers. Unfortunately, he had a fairly underwhelming rookie season and a poor start in his first two games of his second season.</p>

<p>This has led to the major news being revealed today that Bryce is being benched this week in favour of Carolina’s backup QB Andy Dalton.</p>

<p>I think this is somewhat essentially the Panthers admitting Bryce is a bust or maybe looking to help him develop by watching another QB play with the team.</p>

<p>But regardless of the reasoning for the bench, has there ever been a similar situation to Bryce Young’s situation in the NBA?</p>

      <label for="lnhoaav" class="commentText"><p>Obviously different sports, but at least James Wiseman got to play a good number of games whereas Trey Lance didn&rsquo;t. Wiseman wasn&rsquo;t the focal point on the Warriors, which is okay since the team was already good. Like you mentioned, Trey Lance didn&rsquo;t have a lot of QB experience compared to his contemporaries in the same draft class. It didn&rsquo;t make sense why the 49ers drafted him since a lot of scouting reports said this guy was a project QB. The 49ers&rsquo; time table was not the same as Trey&rsquo;s. They just didn&rsquo;t have the time to let Trey develop and grow, so it wasn&rsquo;t feasible to expect a 21 year old project QB to help lead a team full of veterans to a Super Bowl win.</p>

Aiyuk was 22 years old and Deebo was only 24. The plan was clearly to let him sit for a season or two while Jimmy is there then have him takeover a team with playmakers ready to go like the Chiefs did.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ehhh, Bennett was a pretty good versatile scoring 4 in college with good hustle. Was exactly what the cavs needed. Unfortunately he got injured and fell massively out of shape before ever getting to play in the nba. Then had his confidence absolutely destroyed by media because of the pressures of being #1 pick. In hindsight oladipo was the obvious best player in the draft but their wasn&rsquo;t really a consensus #1 choice in the lottery and with Kyrie and Dion waiters (who at the time was pretty decent) they didn&rsquo;t need to pick a guard.</p>

Outside of dipo who took 2 teams to reach his peak which of those players did? It wasn&rsquo;t a great draft but he was still projected as a highly athletic 4 who could shoot and crash boards hard.  Again,  exactly what cleveland needed.  Unfortunately he never got into nba shape like he had in college.</p>

Wiseman was injured for basically the first year and a half.  By the time he got healthy the Ws sort couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to use him in a league that no longer uses conventional big men.   
But to your point they expected big things from him and he never developed into a player people thought he could be.</p>

Also when you factor in what we had to give up for Bryce ontop of his awful play hes probably the worst QB ever to play in the NFL as a starter with long-term expectations. Worse than Zach Wilson, worse than Jamarcus. It&rsquo;s honestly that bad. And his O-line is doing really well this season so it really has pretty much all been on him and he looks even worse than last year somehow.</p>

      <label for="lnh8d2w" class="commentText"><p>Anthony Bennet is a tough one as not a single person outside the Cavaliers organization (not even Bennett himself) believed he was good enough to be the #1 overall pick prior to draft night, whereas Bryce Young was a heisman trophy winner and was widely expected to go #1 overall.</p>

<p>Bennett being a bust was almost a sure thing IMO.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s a little bit of revisionist history. Defensively, he was bad at UNLV, but it was similar to Anthony Edwards. He was lazy and got lost, but he was very mobile, had a huge wingspan, and showed flashes of defense.</p>

<p>Offensively, he shot 38% from three and was an elite finisher (94th percentile). He was fluid, crazy athletic, strong, had huge hands and a huge wingspan, and seemed like he could shoot.</p>

<p>The draft sucked and was really flat though, so most teams saw him as a low-end starter.</p>

      <label for="lni8518" class="commentText"><p>I think that happens at positions other than QB sometimes in the NFL, like Tavon Austin. The issue is each position itself is more specialized and if you can&rsquo;t hold up there there&rsquo;s nowhere to go. Like, Alex Caruso is a guy who can&rsquo;t get you a lot of points, won&rsquo;t run the offense and is up and down as a shooter, but he will hustle and he&rsquo;s relentless on defense. For a WR, you can&rsquo;t really hustle your way into the lineup like that. You either get open or you don&rsquo;t. Maybe fringe guys stay a little longer for run blocking but that&rsquo;s it.</p>

      <label for="lnhg043" class="commentText"><p>Probably because there are 82 games in an NBA season, and also because more NBA games are blow-outs one war or another. So if a coach is figuring out how to fit a player in, he can fiddle around with their style and position during some boring mid-season blow-out win or loss. Also, NFL positions are more discrete, and QB is way more important. You can&rsquo;t have a QB who isn&rsquo;t working out, but if your 3 and D forward is more 3 than D, you can just find a way to adjust to that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>News flash, players with low floors and mediocre ceilings don&rsquo;t get mocked in the first round, let along top 10. Absolute hindsight bias with comments like these.</p>

<p>Anthony Bennet in college looked great. He was essentially an identical prospect to Julius Randle. Theyre both about the same in athleticism, physical size and skills. Bennett just didn&rsquo;t have the mentality or determination of being an NBA pro. Injury during his rookie off-season was also not a great start. Came in rookie season way out of shape.</p>

I’d like to see him on a team that believes in him or at least gives him a proper chance.</p>

<p>Kris Dun was kinda like this, bounced around till he was out of the league. Came back, got a chance in Portland and has been pretty good since. Wanna see if he continues to play will on the clips.</p>

<p>Dante Exum is kinda the same in terms of how his career has gone.</p>

<p>Their stories aren’t like Bryce but maybe watching Andy will help him improve but I’d still like to see him on another squad</p>

<p>i think it&rsquo;s the reverse. Tepper definitely does want to win, he just has no idea how to do it and keeps throwing his ideas into the ring when he needs to defer to people who know what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s deservedly enemy #1 in Carolina sports right now, but I&rsquo;ll give him the fact he&rsquo;s trying. If he was just using the team as a cash cow, he wouldn&rsquo;t be firing failed coaches and front office people and paying out tons of extra contracts to them.</p>

Hornets just drafted bad for awhile, hopefully hit some locks. Gm this year got some alright players in FA so if Lamelo can stay healthy, they could make the play-in</p>

He had one way of playing defense (have all perimeter defenders collapse into the paint and allow shooters to shoot whatever they want)&hellip; and then when it was figured out by the rest of the league, it was over. His offenses never graduated from being painfully predictable (get it to the best scorer and everyone else GTFO the way)</p>

<p>Outside of that his first round picks were PJ Washington, Miles Bridges (awful person, good player) in the SGA trade, Lamelo, Mark Williams, and Brandon Miller.</p>

<p>All of those guys are legit NBA level starters. So he hit on 5 out of 6 years when it came to drafting in the first round. How many GMs in the league can actually say that?</p>

Dude is going out of his way trying whatever he can to win. He literally doesn&rsquo;t know wtf he&rsquo;s doing though. He wants to be Jerry Jones. Reality is he ain&rsquo;t even close.

<p>THIS. This right here is the big issue. He wants to be the architect of everything instead of just being the money guy. He needs to accept the money guy role for the team to find success. Because clearly the team is not finding success with him as guy running the show.</p>

They beefed up the offensive line, traded and drafted weapons for him, and hired a coach with a history of turning QBs around.  They were even asking him for his input on offseason moves, which is insane, teams in the NBA do that, NFL orgs do not.</p>

<p>Through 2 games he&rsquo;s had tons of time in the pocket and guys have been open.  He&rsquo;s just been really, <em>really</em> bad.  Whatever confidence he had in college is gone and all that&rsquo;s left is a guy who can&rsquo;t see over his linemen.</p>

<p>Philly trading up for Markelle Fultz and passing on Jayson Tatum also parallels the ungodly package we used to move up to #1 for Bryce instead of Stroud, but Bryce doesn&rsquo;t have the injury excuses Fultz has.</p>

<p>NFL teams treat their players like cattle to begin with, but rushing a rookie into a position that requires time to adjust to is perhaps the most backwards thing the NFL does.</p>

<p>The GOAT-tier of modern Quarterbacks is well-populated guys who spent time learning under a star- Rodgers, Brady, Garrapolo, Steve Young, Warner, Foles, Cunningham, Romo, Cousins, Dilfwr, etc etc.</p>

      <label for="lnh5ri9" class="commentText"><p>yeah it&rsquo;s much more about the athleticism. I was a HUGE fan, but even prior to the ACL, you could tell that he was having real trouble with NBA athletes. I was legitimately more intrigued by our other rookie Walter Herrmann by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Bryce&rsquo;s athleticism isn&rsquo;t too bad, but it&rsquo;s fair to equate his lack of size to Morrison&rsquo;s lack of athleticism. It looks like too much to overcome even if he does drastically improve skills-wise.</p>

Heisman winning QB at Alabama, coached by Saban, seems like a no-brainer. That said, before the 2023 draft, I was telling my friends that CJ Stroud would be the better pro QB; so far so good on that prediction.</p>

<p>The Pistons traded him after his rookie year to Denver and got 2 bad players (Mengke Bateer, Don Reid) and a future 1st round pick in return.</p>

<p>White only played 4 NBA seasons and didn&rsquo;t do much.</p>
