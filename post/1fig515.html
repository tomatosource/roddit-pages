</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Bryce Young was chosen number 1 in the 2023 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers. Unfortunately, he had a fairly underwhelming rookie season and a poor start in his first two games of his second season.</p>

<p>This has led to the major news being revealed today that Bryce is being benched this week in favour of Carolina’s backup QB Andy Dalton.</p>

<p>I think this is somewhat essentially the Panthers admitting Bryce is a bust or maybe looking to help him develop by watching another QB play with the team.</p>

<p>But regardless of the reasoning for the bench, has there ever been a similar situation to Bryce Young’s situation in the NBA?</p>

      <label for="lnhoaav" class="commentText"><p>Obviously different sports, but at least James Wiseman got to play a good number of games whereas Trey Lance didn&rsquo;t. Wiseman wasn&rsquo;t the focal point on the Warriors, which is okay since the team was already good. Like you mentioned, Trey Lance didn&rsquo;t have a lot of QB experience compared to his contemporaries in the same draft class. It didn&rsquo;t make sense why the 49ers drafted him since a lot of scouting reports said this guy was a project QB. The 49ers&rsquo; time table was not the same as Trey&rsquo;s. They just didn&rsquo;t have the time to let Trey develop and grow, so it wasn&rsquo;t feasible to expect a 21 year old project QB to help lead a team full of veterans to a Super Bowl win.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ehhh, Bennett was a pretty good versatile scoring 4 in college with good hustle. Was exactly what the cavs needed. Unfortunately he got injured and fell massively out of shape before ever getting to play in the nba. Then had his confidence absolutely destroyed by media because of the pressures of being #1 pick. In hindsight oladipo was the obvious best player in the draft but their wasn&rsquo;t really a consensus #1 choice in the lottery and with Kyrie and Dion waiters (who at the time was pretty decent) they didn&rsquo;t need to pick a guard.</p>

Wiseman was injured for basically the first year and a half.  By the time he got healthy the Ws sort couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to use him in a league that no longer uses conventional big men.   
But to your point they expected big things from him and he never developed into a player people thought he could be.</p>

<p>No. He’s tiny, not an NFL athlete at all, can’t read defenses, and lacks arm talent.</p>

<p>Again, sacks are a QB stat. There’s a reason this is the consensus nowadays. The best QBs avoid sacks.</p>

He was an outstanding QB prospect in college, considered one of the best since Andrew Luck. The panthers traded the farm for him for a reason.</p>

<p>I agree that sometimes things don’t work out, but by all accounts he’s worked hard and was known for his excellent processing in high school and college. Something has gone terribly wrong (not saying it isn’t his fault, just that something absolutely went wrong somewhere). However, it has been shown time and time again that QBs do not come back the same after a 60+ sack season, especially rookie QBs</p>

<p>He is a huge bust and the panthers failed him his rookie year. Both can be true</p>

Also when you factor in what we had to give up for Bryce ontop of his awful play hes probably the worst QB ever to play in the NFL as a starter with long-term expectations. Worse than Zach Wilson, worse than Jamarcus. It&rsquo;s honestly that bad. And his O-line is doing really well this season so it really has pretty much all been on him and he looks even worse than last year somehow.</p>

      <label for="lnhg043" class="commentText"><p>Probably because there are 82 games in an NBA season, and also because more NBA games are blow-outs one war or another. So if a coach is figuring out how to fit a player in, he can fiddle around with their style and position during some boring mid-season blow-out win or loss. Also, NFL positions are more discrete, and QB is way more important. You can&rsquo;t have a QB who isn&rsquo;t working out, but if your 3 and D forward is more 3 than D, you can just find a way to adjust to that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>News flash, players with low floors and mediocre ceilings don&rsquo;t get mocked in the first round, let along top 10. Absolute hindsight bias with comments like these.</p>

<p>Anthony Bennet in college looked great. He was essentially an identical prospect to Julius Randle. Theyre both about the same in athleticism, physical size and skills. Bennett just didn&rsquo;t have the mentality or determination of being an NBA pro. Injury during his rookie off-season was also not a great start. Came in rookie season way out of shape.</p>

I’d like to see him on a team that believes in him or at least gives him a proper chance.</p>

<p>Kris Dun was kinda like this, bounced around till he was out of the league. Came back, got a chance in Portland and has been pretty good since. Wanna see if he continues to play will on the clips.</p>

<p>Dante Exum is kinda the same in terms of how his career has gone.</p>

<p>Their stories aren’t like Bryce but maybe watching Andy will help him improve but I’d still like to see him on another squad</p>

<p>i think it&rsquo;s the reverse. Tepper definitely does want to win, he just has no idea how to do it and keeps throwing his ideas into the ring when he needs to defer to people who know what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s deservedly enemy #1 in Carolina sports right now, but I&rsquo;ll give him the fact he&rsquo;s trying. If he was just using the team as a cash cow, he wouldn&rsquo;t be firing failed coaches and front office people and paying out tons of extra contracts to them.</p>

<p><em>glares at MJ allowing Steve Clifford and Mitch Kupchak to terrorize Charlotte for more than half a decade</em></p>

Hornets just drafted bad for awhile, hopefully hit some locks. Gm this year got some alright players in FA so if Lamelo can stay healthy, they could make the play-in</p>

      <label for="lnh7h1u" class="commentText"><p>Cliff was a good coach in 2014 and then never again. He had one way of playing defense (have all perimeter defenders collapse into the paint and allow shooters to shoot whatever they want)&hellip; and then when it was figured out by the rest of the league, it was over. His offenses never graduated from being painfully predictable (get it to the best scorer and everyone else GTFO the way)</p>

<p>Year 2-3 MKG was all of that defensively, but he just never got close offensively, had serious confidence issues with his offense, and then injuries finished off whatever remaining chance he had at developing.</p>

<p>Philly trading up for Markelle Fultz and passing on Jayson Tatum also parallels the ungodly package we used to move up to #1 for Bryce instead of Stroud, but Bryce doesn&rsquo;t have the injury excuses Fultz has.</p>

      <label for="lnh5ri9" class="commentText"><p>yeah it&rsquo;s much more about the athleticism. I was a HUGE fan, but even prior to the ACL, you could tell that he was having real trouble with NBA athletes. I was legitimately more intrigued by our other rookie Walter Herrmann by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Bryce&rsquo;s athleticism isn&rsquo;t too bad, but it&rsquo;s fair to equate his lack of size to Morrison&rsquo;s lack of athleticism. It looks like too much to overcome even if he does drastically improve skills-wise.</p>

He wasn&rsquo;t a raw athlete or anything, he had good accuracy and was good at reading a defense and going thru progressions. But he just doesn&rsquo;t have the size or athleticism to make up for his tiny stature in NFL pockets.</p>

Heisman winning QB at Alabama, coached by Saban, seems like a no-brainer. That said, before the 2023 draft, I was telling my friends that CJ Stroud would be the better pro QB; so far so good on that prediction.</p>

And he couldn&rsquo;t even show off his 3pt shooting skills cuz he was too small to get separation and got blocked all the time, couldn&rsquo;t make simple passes cuz he was too small etc.</p>

      <label for="lnht1tg" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I don&rsquo;t keep up with football anymore, but back when I did, rookie qb&rsquo;s rarely even started. As a number 1 pick yea you&rsquo;d expect him to be good but would give it a few years. Maybe he needs a different playbook. Maybe it&rsquo;s just gonna take him a couple years to learn the verbiage and timing of the NFL. Idk just me personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t give up on him just yet if I were the owner of that team</p>
