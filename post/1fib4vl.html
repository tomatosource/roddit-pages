</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>He currently is on a partially guaranteed contract with the pacers. The good is that he&rsquo;s just 23 and had a few 20 point double doubles towards the end of last year. The bad is that his advanced stats were arguably the worst in the league. Worst in net rating for anyone that played as many games last year. Also the year before he was dead last in individual net rating, so not an aberration. The eye test confirms the advanced stats. Will he earn a spot to get rotation minutes or is he cooked?</p>

He would have to make a substantial leap to do that considering he is genuinely one of the worst basketball players I have had the displeasure of watching.</p>

He&rsquo;s definitely a guy where I look at him and wonder what could have been if he had a more normal development cycle (rather than basically no college, covid year, injuries, etc.).</p>

<p>I obviously saw him more on the Warriors than I did on the Pistons but here he had some nice scoring nights once in awhile but his (especially) defensive instincts were horrible, he had trouble picking up the Warriors scheme on both ends (understandable given his lack of experience) and he had a lot of injuries&hellip;.basically looked like a guy who could get you some buckets sometimes but didn&rsquo;t know how to do anything else on the floor really. The few times I was able to see him on the Pistons he still looked pretty much the same although I&rsquo;m sure a Pistons fan could elaborate on improvements/regressions.</p>

      <label for="lnj7r3h" class="commentText"><p>He actually looked significantly worse year over year which was shocking. Had some legitimately nice flashes in his rookie year. He was coming off screens and pulling, going coast to coast and dunking with his off hand, and hitting some nice face ups. Maybe the injury did something to him? After he came back from that he just started spamming the same exact roll to the basket where he just clogged the paint and demanded the ball while his teammate drove into him. It was some mind boggling npc shit. I legitimately don’t know how someone can get so much worse at basketball </p>

      <label for="lnhde61" class="commentText"><p>He was never that guy. He&rsquo;s an incredible athlete who wants to play like he&rsquo;s a wing, but he&rsquo;s got nearly zero skills that you need an NBA center to have (literally cannot set screens, doesn&rsquo;t rebound well, doesn&rsquo;t understand where to stand, doesn&rsquo;t know how to get position for rebounds, and on and on and on).</p>

<p>People act like rim running and blocking shots are purely athletic activities, while in reality there&rsquo;s so much basketball IQ and timing required to do either. Wiseman doesn&rsquo;t have those.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a nice kid and I hope he can find a basketball role of some kind, but he doesn&rsquo;t feel or anticipate the game <em>at all</em>.</p>

His inability to screen was a major reason he was unplayable for the Warriors. I honestly thought he&rsquo;d be able to go somewhere and put up some decent empty numbers while learning the mental game.  Guess that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not an NBA scout / GM. Seems like a nice kid so good luck Big Jim, but maybe just not cut out for the league. </p>

<p>The big issue is that he&rsquo;s dumb- he&rsquo;s always been slow to learn defensive schemes (low BBIQ), and he also doesn&rsquo;t understand how to stand in one place and set a pick (low IQ). There&rsquo;s no real upside there.</p>

      <label for="lnghn5d" class="commentText"><p>He missed almost all of college because of a dumb eligibility issue, he missed his rookie training camp with COVID, then after he played a little he got hurt, then missed a full year with a knee issue, then missed some time in his 3rd year with some injuries and because he was killing the team, then got traded to a team with another, better young center. Last year was the first time he&rsquo;s had consistent minutes since his senior year of high school in 2018-2019.</p>

<p>He might just stink, but there are very few players at that level of raw ability who have played that little basketball during what should be the most important developmental stretch of their career. And it&rsquo;s been especially damaging, because he has very good skills, but horrible feel and so if he were to ever improve, it would almost certainly be just by playing a lot to get the timing and feel down.</p>

<p>At this point, It seems like he might be better off in the Euroleague or the G League because I think he just needs to be able to play 30 minutes a night for a year to see if the BBIQ comes along.</p>

<p>As the only true center backup on the Pacers roster, he will get some minutes to prove himself.  Guys like Lopez or Embid overpower Jackson with a sneeze.</p>

<p>But ya, he was signed as a vet min, 4th string center</p>

<p>Will see how we utilize Walker this year (might be a 9 man rotation for playoffs).</p>

<p>In the playoffs at the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> it was almost all Turner/Siakam/Toppin</p>

<p>We rarely played small at the 4.</p>

<p>Then the back 3, Nesmith, Haliburton, McConnel, Nembhard.  Last year we had to use Shepherd with Mathurins injury but my guess is Mathurin is in the 8 this year.</p>

<p>However, in the center rotation we will run he is 4th string.</p>

<p>Turner &amp;gt; Siakam &amp;gt; Jackson &amp;gt; Wiseman</p>

<p>While neither Siakam or Jackson are centers, they will spend plenty of time at it.  A lot of teams rotations allow the Pacers to play a front line of Siakam and Toppin for 8 to 12 minutes a game.</p>

      <label for="lngymfx" class="commentText"><p>On a team like the Pacers, who have to feel good about their chances after playing really hard in a close sweep to Boston, I doubt he gets much of any time outside of garbage minutes. Toppin and Jackson will be more than good enough to secure minutes and unless something wrong happens to Walker, he should be that 3rd big off the pine before Wiseman.</p>

<p>James will probably see a lot of G-League time if the Pacers are smart and if Wiseman ends up doing a lot better than expected then MAYBE he can be 3rd big off the bench if Walker is not coming along as expected.</p>

      <label for="lni0d2y" class="commentText"><p>i think his best chance at minutes is to make the most of opportunities against backup bigs like Drummond — IJax doesn’t have the strength to deal with these types of matchups and is prone to fouling so Wiseman just needs to prove he can be a big body, set some solid screens, and rebound well and he might gradually earn more.</p>
