<p>The above quote was taken from Paul George, presumably from an episode of Podcast P. Though I have not seen the video. I know I’m biased as a Harden and Rockets fan, but I truly don’t believe harden would be (possibly) in PGs ear if he wasn’t truly wronged. One of the nbas biggest mysteries imo.</p>

<p>Do you think this could potentially burn the sixers for future free agents?</p>

<p>Now that OKC have a legit title window he’s gonna be sending people to the shadow realm to improve his roster.  Before he was sending players to contenders for picks.</p>

<p>He has not yet proved his ability to SPEND these assets yet so this will definitely change a lot of things.</p>

      <label for="l9chh4n" class="commentText"><p>Fuck Morey, but I do like to note that this is just the GM version of flopping. There&rsquo;s no advantage and some possible disadvantages to Morey telling CP or Harden or Melo about his moves ahead of time. It&rsquo;s the way it is; it&rsquo;s the nature of the game.</p>

<p>When people ask Harden or CP about flopping or something, they&rsquo;re both like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s part of the game and as long as it&rsquo;s advantageous to do so, I&rsquo;ll do it. Make it illegal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s their shit, they&rsquo;re both cutthroat AF and only want to win. When a GM thinks that doing something that, in their eyes, gives the team the best chance to win and takes it at the player&rsquo;s detriment, all of a sudden they&rsquo;re like &ldquo;wait, there&rsquo;s a code.&rdquo;</p>

Most GMs do that because they want players to hear it from them, rather than the media. The asshole part of it is calling Chris Paul, telling him they won’t trade him to OKC, and then proceeding to do it anyway. There’s literally 0 reason to call him and tell him that, especially if you know there’s a chance you <em>will</em> trade him.</p>

It&rsquo;s one thing for players to be mad at you for making a business decision, it&rsquo;s another for them to be mad that you lied to them. It may or may not impact his ability to do business with players in the future, but I think there is some small advantage to being a GM that is known to run an organization that is fair and open with players.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I go over to the gym to go work out and Daryl call me…He said ‘I was just calling you to make sure you didn’t wanna go to OKC.’ I was like, ‘No, why I don’ moved 15 people to Houston.’ And he was like, ‘Okay I was just making sure.’ He was like ‘I would never trade you to somewhere you didn’t want to go because you chose to come to us from the Clippers,’”</p>

<p>“I chose to go to Houston from LA…I’m at the house chilling, I was on the phone with Jada [Chris’ wife] and next thing you know [the alert] said that I was getting traded [to OKC],</p>

<p>“And then my phone started ringing and it was Daryl calling. So I ain’t know…Daryl was like, ‘Hey man, it just moves so fast.’ I said, ‘It’s all good I just want you to tell me one thing. You said you wasn’t going to trade me, right?’ He said, ‘Yeah I said that but–’ I said, ‘That’s all I needed to know.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1b344xo/chris_paul_reveals_that_daryl_morey_lied_to_him/" target="_blank">source</a></p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s more to the quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“So as soon as Melo told me that (he was released) I got Jada my kids and we got up, I said Rudy (Gay) I gotta go. I went back to the hotel called Melo went to his room knocked on the door or what not, and I was in there with Melo for along time, a couple hours.</p>

<p>“<strong>And Melo was in tears and I know how much he gave to the game but throughout the whole process of him coming to Houston me and Melo would talk about… all this stuff, I never said this is going to happen or not going to happen. So he tells me what happens with Daryl and I was like what? He came in his room told him he’d get him a flight back to New York, how do you say this to this man? Some of the most disrespectful sh*t I seen</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Remember that PG teamed with Melo.</p>

His problem in every story seems to be that he wants to be buddy-buddy with the players, and that leads to a lot of yappin&rsquo; and making promises he can&rsquo;t keep.</p>

      <label for="l9d6g5t" class="commentText"><p>Assuming this to be the case, then yeah he did Harden dirty. But the mistake was making the promise in the first place. Philly fans (and possibly management) did not want a Harden max after the Boston series and Morey potentially closes Embiids window if that contract doesnt work out. So I don&rsquo;t think not giving the max was a mistake, assuming that he wouldn&rsquo;t of. He just shouldn&rsquo;t promise things he can&rsquo;t keep, as it&rsquo;s ruining his reputation.</p>

      <label for="l9dggsd" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not just a foregone promise though. It was part of the deal with Harden and Harden made MASSIVE sacrifices keeping his end of the bargain.</p>

<p>In summer of 2022, Harden opted out of his <span class="math inline">\(47M player option and signed a \)</span>32M extension to give the Sixers flexibility to sign PJ Tucker. He lost out on $15M because Daryl promised him he would give him a max extension after.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s also not mentioning that there&rsquo;s speculation Morey tampered with Harden when he was on the Nets and convinced him not to sign an extension there and demand a trade to Philly. These are HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS Harden has lost out on because Morey&rsquo;s a sleazeball.</p>

<p>According to him he made the sacrifice to help the team win. He also got two of his friends on the team. He probably got promised a contract and that&rsquo;s where I think the mistake is on Morey&rsquo;s part IMO. Morey didn&rsquo;t get the chance to have contract negotiations, but assuming Harden was right and he wasn&rsquo;t getting a max, then that was probably the right decision and possibly the only one management gave him. Doesn&rsquo;t make it not a shitty thing to do, I&rsquo;m just saying it wasn&rsquo;t the wrong decision to not max him, it was wrong promising him he would.</p>

<p>And no, neither guy was worth it and neither guy would have gotten that from any other team. House was just trying to get on minimums before that and PJ was obviously washed.</p>

<p>The Nets were done after the Kyrie situation - this wasn’t about Daryl not making him extend.</p>

      <label for="l9djro1" class="commentText"><p>Harden literally turned down a max extension from the Nets before the season started. Now why would he do that if he fully intended to stay with the Nets long term?</p>

<p>Tucker was coming off 2 seasons where he won a championship (bucks) and made the conference finals (Heat) as a key contributor. There were lots of suitors willing to pay up for him back then, his contract only looks bad in hindsight because he got way more washed after he joined the Sixers.</p>

<p>And even if Tucker wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten that money from someone else, it still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Harden lost out on $15M that season because he was promised a max extension that never came.</p>

But he picked the Rockets and not only did they give him only 10 games before sending him home, they didn&rsquo;t even release him.  They held on to him until the end of January, and by then none of the contenders wanted him.  If they were going to tank his whole season after just 10 games, why even bother signing him in the first place.  Should&rsquo;ve just let him go to the Heat.</p>

      <label for="l9dfxs5" class="commentText"><p>They were crying because they thought Melo&rsquo;s career was over.  They weren&rsquo;t crying over a trade.</p>

<p>The thing was Melo didn&rsquo;t get traded then.  Before the season, Melo had turned down offers from other teams including the Heat to sign a minimum deal with the Rockets.  He came off the bench for the first time in his career for the Rockets and struggled to adjust to his new role.  After just 10 games, Morey told him it wasn&rsquo;t working out and that Melo should go home.  Literally didn&rsquo;t want him around the team anymore.  But Morey didn&rsquo;t trade or release him right away.</p>

<p>Melo had to go home and wait over two more months until he was actually traded.  He was sent home 11/9/2018, didn&rsquo;t get traded until 1/22/2019.  In that time, what was left of his reputation was trashed.  No one wanted to sign him.</p>

<p>Portland eventually signed him the following season but Melo had to spend the entire summer literally begging and pleading for a roster spot and promising anyone who would listen that he was a good teammate and could be a role player.  And for the three years of his career that followed, he actually was.</p>

<p>All of them understand it&rsquo;s a business, and trades happen. These are vets in the league, who have been traded before. Just don&rsquo;t needlessly lie and you&rsquo;ll have a solid rep, the same way a majority of the GMs in the league manage to do.</p>

Embiid has likely peaked as a player and is going to be eligible for a 3 year/200m extension in the off-season. It&rsquo;s going to be really interesting to see what happens if/when the Sixers lose before the ECF this upcoming year.</p>

      <label for="l9d09pz" class="commentText"><p>I disagree with the timeline. Joel Embiid loves Morey because Morey loves his stars. No matter what happens in the playoffs you know Daryll is going to offer Embiid max money no question even if the fans do a turn and want him gone. No matter how Joel feels about anything I think he’s concerned with securing the bag first and requesting out after he signs.</p>

<p>The only way that he isn’t offered a max is if they fire Morey after this season goes to shit. He has personally staked so much on this specific offseason that if they don’t make some major move then his tenure here is done. So yes potentially midnight for the Morey era but realistically Embiid has another 2 years before he requests out.</p>

The implication, in my opinion, was that you might have to pay them more or give them more contractual security to overcome their distrust, if they come to Philly at all.</p>

      <label for="l9df22n" class="commentText"><p>I think it was 2018. Playoff game between Sixers and Celtics in Philly. Sixers were down 2 and one of their guys hit a buzzer beater 3 to &lsquo;win&rsquo; the game. Confetti pours down from the ceiling.</p>

<p>But by that point it had already become clear that his foot was on the 3 point line, and it was going to go to overtime. Refs confirmed it, so it was time to play 5 more minutes&hellip;</p>

<p>Except they had to delay the game until every single piece of confetti fell and got collected - player safety or whatever. So everyone got to chill and wait for a few minutes while making fun of the Sixers&rsquo; improperly timed confetti.</p>

<p>Of course, the Celtics would go on to win in overtime, eventually win that series, and later win a couple more series against the Sixers without dropping one. In retrospect, it was a big symbolic moment at the start of what has been a very one-sided not-quite-rivalry (Embiid&rsquo;s words).</p>

<p>There is so much you dont know. Nurse&rsquo;s wife for instance is a big anti-vax person and held a function in COVID for the team and some of the players got sick. The trust was already dwindling after that.</p>

The point I am making is I don&rsquo;t think Nurse being a tough coach is a deterrent when the other option is Thibs, which was what the original poster was trying to say.</p>

      <label for="l9d0948" class="commentText"><p>Oh this definitely sounds like him addressing the Sixers rumors. Morey’s done a lot for the sport and was a pioneer in using analytics, but his ego has prevented him from ever accomplishing anything significant. Now that his shine has worn off, I imagine a lot of players don’t want to work with him. No matter how good the basketball situation is for PG to go to Philly, the organization isn’t as soundly run as the Clippers even.</p>

      <label for="l9d6fnf" class="commentText"><p>If PG does end up going to Philly, it&rsquo;s a different situation because he&rsquo;d have his contract up front.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there were things that Morey could have done better in the Harden situation, but anyone that genuinely believes that Harden leaked the Houston news on Christmas (at the literal height of the Harden Sixers tenure when they were considered one of the top teams) then immediately hired an agent for the first time since his last negotiable contract all well having a backroom agreed to deal already in place, then I don&rsquo;t even know what to say.  Everything he did that year was in line with somebody that was playing for a new contract and didn&rsquo;t have shit locked in.  Shit, him even exploring other teams with this supposed promised deal is hypocritical as hell and would make him a liar too, so that bit didn&rsquo;t even make sense.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying Morey is perfect, but the James Harden situation in Philly is not a great example to go by.  Nobody knows what truly happened, but there&rsquo;s more reason to believe that Harden&rsquo;s ego was bruised more than Morey&rsquo;s word was broken.</p>

<ul>
<li>Harden re-signed with Philly and just 10 weeks into the season his camp was already leaking Houston rumors.

<li>That&rsquo;s not something you do if you were just promised a max contract behind the scenes.<br>

<li>Harden came out and said Morey is a liar.<br>
