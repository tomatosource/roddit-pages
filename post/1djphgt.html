<p>The above quote was taken from Paul George, presumably from an episode of Podcast P. Though I have not seen the video. I know I’m biased as a Harden and Rockets fan, but I truly don’t believe harden would be (possibly) in PGs ear if he wasn’t truly wronged. One of the nbas biggest mysteries imo.</p>

<p>Do you think this could potentially burn the sixers for future free agents?</p>

      <label for="l9chh4n" class="commentText"><p>Fuck Morey, but I do like to note that this is just the GM version of flopping. There&rsquo;s no advantage and some possible disadvantages to Morey telling CP or Harden or Melo about his moves ahead of time. It&rsquo;s the way it is; it&rsquo;s the nature of the game.</p>

<p>When people ask Harden or CP about flopping or something, they&rsquo;re both like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s part of the game and as long as it&rsquo;s advantageous to do so, I&rsquo;ll do it. Make it illegal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s their shit, they&rsquo;re both cutthroat AF and only want to win. When a GM thinks that doing something that, in their eyes, gives the team the best chance to win and takes it at the player&rsquo;s detriment, all of a sudden they&rsquo;re like &ldquo;wait, there&rsquo;s a code.&rdquo;</p>

Most GMs do that because they want players to hear it from them, rather than the media. The asshole part of it is calling Chris Paul, telling him they won’t trade him to OKC, and then proceeding to do it anyway. There’s literally 0 reason to call him and tell him that, especially if you know there’s a chance you <em>will</em> trade him.</p>

      <label for="l9cla69" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but the dude needs to either not lie to the players and tell them they could be traded; or at the very least, imply that they won&rsquo;t be traded without actually saying it. It&rsquo;s one thing for players to be mad at you for making a business decision, it&rsquo;s another for them to be mad that you lied to them. It may or may not impact his ability to do business with players in the future, but I think there is some small advantage to being a GM that is known to run an organization that is fair and open with players.</p>

<p>“I go over to the gym to go work out and Daryl call me…He said ‘I was just calling you to make sure you didn’t wanna go to OKC.’ I was like, ‘No, why I don’ moved 15 people to Houston.’ And he was like, ‘Okay I was just making sure.’ He was like ‘I would never trade you to somewhere you didn’t want to go because you chose to come to us from the Clippers,’”</p>

<p>“I chose to go to Houston from LA…I’m at the house chilling, I was on the phone with Jada [Chris’ wife] and next thing you know [the alert] said that I was getting traded [to OKC],</p>

<p>“And then my phone started ringing and it was Daryl calling. So I ain’t know…Daryl was like, ‘Hey man, it just moves so fast.’ I said, ‘It’s all good I just want you to tell me one thing. You said you wasn’t going to trade me, right?’ He said, ‘Yeah I said that but–’ I said, ‘That’s all I needed to know.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1b344xo/chris_paul_reveals_that_daryl_morey_lied_to_him/" target="_blank">source</a></p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s more to the quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“So as soon as Melo told me that (he was released) I got Jada my kids and we got up, I said Rudy (Gay) I gotta go. I went back to the hotel called Melo went to his room knocked on the door or what not, and I was in there with Melo for along time, a couple hours.</p>

<p>“<strong>And Melo was in tears and I know how much he gave to the game but throughout the whole process of him coming to Houston me and Melo would talk about… all this stuff, I never said this is going to happen or not going to happen. So he tells me what happens with Daryl and I was like what? He came in his room told him he’d get him a flight back to New York, how do you say this to this man? Some of the most disrespectful sh*t I seen</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Remember that PG teamed with Melo.</p>

But then he received an enticing trade offer that was too good for him to refuse and just accepted it without a second thought. His problem in every story seems to be that he wants to be buddy-buddy with the players, and that leads to a lot of yappin&rsquo; and making promises he can&rsquo;t keep.</p>

Embiid has likely peaked as a player and is going to be eligible for a 3 year/200m extension in the off-season. It&rsquo;s going to be really interesting to see what happens if/when the Sixers lose before the ECF this upcoming year.</p>

      <label for="l9d09pz" class="commentText"><p>I disagree with the timeline. Joel Embiid loves Morey because Morey loves his stars. No matter what happens in the playoffs you know Daryll is going to offer Embiid max money no question even if the fans do a turn and want him gone. No matter how Joel feels about anything I think he’s concerned with securing the bag first and requesting out after he signs.</p>

<p>The only way that he isn’t offered a max is if they fire Morey after this season goes to shit. He has personally staked so much on this specific offseason that if they don’t make some major move then his tenure here is done. So yes potentially midnight for the Morey era but realistically Embiid has another 2 years before he requests out.</p>

      <label for="l9ch6i5" class="commentText"><p>Danny Green did an interview on the Rights to Ricky Sanchez podcast (a sixers pod), and he said something pretty similar on Paul George probably having heard bad things about Morey from Harden, and that mattering, and, furthermore, that players around the league don&rsquo;t trust Morey, and will be harder to convinced to come to Philly. The implication, in my opinion, was that you might have to pay them more or give them more contractual security to overcome their distrust, if they come to Philly at all.</p>

      <label for="l9d0948" class="commentText"><p>Oh this definitely sounds like him addressing the Sixers rumors. Morey’s done a lot for the sport and was a pioneer in using analytics, but his ego has prevented him from ever accomplishing anything significant. Now that his shine has worn off, I imagine a lot of players don’t want to work with him. No matter how good the basketball situation is for PG to go to Philly, the organization isn’t as soundly run as the Clippers even.</p>

<p>I know I’m biased as a Harden and Rockets fan, but I truly don’t believe harden would be (possibly) in PGs ear if he wasn’t truly wronged. One of the nbas biggest mysteries imo.</p>

<ul>
<li>Harden re-signed with Philly and just 10 weeks into the season his camp was already leaking Houston rumors.

<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s not something you do if you were just promised a max contract behind the scenes.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Harden came out and said Morey is a liar.<br>
</li>
<li>The NBA investigated and Harden told them it was about his not being traded.<br>


<ul>
<li>Harden was then fined for making a public statement on a trade request.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The only way Harden was wronged is that Morey didn&rsquo;t trade James on <em>his</em> timeline.</p>

<p>Also, later on it was rumored (was it ever confirmed?) that his mom had cancer and he wanted to be with her, either in Houston or to move her to LA.</p>

<p>Being wrong one time doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re wrong every time.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t like Woj.  I think he&rsquo;s a bad teammate.  But he was proven entirely correct here.</p>
