<p>The above quote was taken from Paul George, presumably from an episode of Podcast P. Though I have not seen the video. I know I’m biased as a Harden and Rockets fan, but I truly don’t believe harden would be (possibly) in PGs ear if he wasn’t truly wronged. One of the nbas biggest mysteries imo.</p>

<p>Do you think this could potentially burn the sixers for future free agents?</p>

      <label for="l9cc0xy" class="commentText"><p>Reminded me of something Chris Paul said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I go over to the gym to go work out and Daryl call me…He said ‘I was just calling you to make sure you didn’t wanna go to OKC.’ I was like, ‘No, why I don’ moved 15 people to Houston.’ And he was like, ‘Okay I was just making sure.’ He was like ‘I would never trade you to somewhere you didn’t want to go because you chose to come to us from the Clippers,’”</p>

<p>“I chose to go to Houston from LA…I’m at the house chilling, I was on the phone with Jada [Chris’ wife] and next thing you know [the alert] said that I was getting traded [to OKC],</p>

<p>“And then my phone started ringing and it was Daryl calling. So I ain’t know…Daryl was like, ‘Hey man, it just moves so fast.’ I said, ‘It’s all good I just want you to tell me one thing. You said you wasn’t going to trade me, right?’ He said, ‘Yeah I said that but–’ I said, ‘That’s all I needed to know.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1b344xo/chris_paul_reveals_that_daryl_morey_lied_to_him/" target="_blank">source</a></p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s more to the quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“So as soon as Melo told me that (he was released) I got Jada my kids and we got up, I said Rudy (Gay) I gotta go. I went back to the hotel called Melo went to his room knocked on the door or what not, and I was in there with Melo for along time, a couple hours.</p>

<p>“<strong>And Melo was in tears and I know how much he gave to the game but throughout the whole process of him coming to Houston me and Melo would talk about… all this stuff, I never said this is going to happen or not going to happen. So he tells me what happens with Daryl and I was like what? He came in his room told him he’d get him a flight back to New York, how do you say this to this man? Some of the most disrespectful sh*t I seen</strong>&ldquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that PG teamed with Melo.</p>

He was in a crappy situation in Phoenix and the Celtics didn’t have 3 starting quality PGs. Phoenix was crazy when they assembled that 3 PG lineup.</p>

<p>If he traded him for Kyrie Irving, people were gonna hate him for “Look at what he did to IT after he played his heart out until his body was broken.”</p>

<p>If he didn’t, people would say “Man Ainge lost a step, he coulda had Kyrie but was too loyal to an undersized guard with a broken body.”</p>

<p>No winning for him there so he did what needed to be done. It was always the correct move.</p>

<p>IT and Porzingis had never been that deep in the playoffs before very late into their careers. If their bodies can physically allow them to he on that court in any capacity, they&rsquo;re going on that court.

As others have said the injury was super unfortunate, but I don&rsquo;t think there were any bad guys in that situation (other then Kyrie, Kyrie&rsquo;s always the villain.). If IT would have never been injured, he&rsquo;d probably have still been traded, and hopefully had gotten a max from somebody. But anyone who was a C&rsquo;s fan from back then could tell you that ITs &ldquo;King Of The 4th&rdquo; years were a byproduct of Stevens being a magician with hiding him on defense and getting him open drives/looks. Not trying to under appreciate him, I loved that period of C&rsquo;s history. But nothing happens in a vacuum. </p>

      <label for="l9cl3k0" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s lying per se, he just runs his fucking mouth too much. When he said it, he probably meant it. But then he received an enticing trade offer that was too good for him to refuse and just accepted it without a second thought. His problem in every story seems to be that he wants to be buddy-buddy with the players, and that leads to a lot of yappin&rsquo; and making promises he can&rsquo;t keep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahh man someone gave me a million bucks to bang your ex, it just happened so quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure, most people would understand that it&rsquo;d be stupid for me NOT to do it. However when I told you I&rsquo;m not gonna do something, that doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna do it unless it&rsquo;s beneficial enough for me&rdquo;, it means &ldquo;under no circumstances am I gonna do it&rdquo;. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m lying.</p>

<p>He never has to even ask if he wants to go to OKC, he never has to state he wouldn’t trade him to a spot he doesn’t want to go to or bring up that he chose them over LAC. All of those are just leading CP3 into thinking he’s not going anywhere. You can say he’s not lying explicitly, but he absolutely mislead Chris with his intentions.</p>

True or not. “I’m the smartest guy in the room and I know things and I’ve got your best interests at heart.” People leave those convos felling like they have their back and are looking out for them. That can get you a long way in the world. And sometimes it is true which builds their statue and legend. But eventually enough people will talk and trade stories of all the lies you told them and your new legend is that you’re full of shit and can’t be trusted.</p>

<p>Have worked with a couple of people like that. They always get found out as frauds.</p>

      <label for="l9d6g5t" class="commentText"><p>Assuming this to be the case, then yeah he did Harden dirty. But the mistake was making the promise in the first place. Philly fans (and possibly management) did not want a Harden max after the Boston series and Morey potentially closes Embiids window if that contract doesnt work out. So I don&rsquo;t think not giving the max was a mistake, assuming that he wouldn&rsquo;t of. He just shouldn&rsquo;t promise things he can&rsquo;t keep, as it&rsquo;s ruining his reputation.</p>

<p>In summer of 2022, Harden opted out of his <span class="math inline">\(47M player option and signed a \)</span>32M extension to give the Sixers flexibility to sign PJ Tucker. He lost out on $15M because Daryl promised him he would give him a max extension after.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s also not mentioning that there&rsquo;s speculation Morey tampered with Harden when he was on the Nets and convinced him not to sign an extension there and demand a trade to Philly. These are HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS Harden has lost out on because Morey&rsquo;s a sleazeball.</p>

Jimmy&rsquo;s buddy ratted him out and told Rawls that McNulty didn&rsquo;t want to be on the boat. That&rsquo;s why Jimmy worked so hard to prove that corpse actually came from Rawls&rsquo;s district.</p>

      <label for="l9dyn2f" class="commentText"><p>On the one hand, that’s the model that made his boss the most famous/prominent sportswriter (or sports adjacent writer anyway) of his generation. On the other hand, Simmons clearly loved the stuff he was writing about, even if he was bashing someone. It was light, fun, and - this is critical - well written. Then there’s the difference that Simmons was so relatable for that generation. He was a voice that filled a void in sports media.</p>

<p>O’Connor had some thoughtful stuff and I used to read/listen occasionally, but he quickly felt like one of those “if you disagree with me you must know jackshit about basketball” kind of personalities. And while sure, he watches more basketball than I do - by a lot - it sure as hell doesn’t mean he’s right about everything. Most the other guys at The Ringer (and a few at other outlets) seem to have an air of both playfulness and reverence for the game in a way that he just doesn’t. It’s kind of a bummer. I’m sure he’s a decent guy and he is extremely dedicated to his craft/hoops, but I am just not a fan.</p>

      <label for="l9d15qg" class="commentText"><p>IIRC there was some podcast where former players talked about Morey and unfavorably compared him to Sam Presti, and said that even though it’s a business, Presti just shows much better regard for the human side of things than Morey and is a big reason why players don’t mind being in OKC</p>

Not sure why players constantly fell for his buddy buddy bullshit.  Reminds me a lot of a certain presidential candidate in that way&hellip;</p>

<p>but with that kind of reputation he’s reducing his value to the organization and affecting the team’s ability to attract top talent. philly has enough problems. they don’t need another executive liability like colangelo.</p>

      <label for="l9d09pz" class="commentText"><p>I disagree with the timeline. Joel Embiid loves Morey because Morey loves his stars. No matter what happens in the playoffs you know Daryll is going to offer Embiid max money no question even if the fans do a turn and want him gone. No matter how Joel feels about anything I think he’s concerned with securing the bag first and requesting out after he signs.</p>

<p>The only way that he isn’t offered a max is if they fire Morey after this season goes to shit. He has personally staked so much on this specific offseason that if they don’t make some major move then his tenure here is done. So yes potentially midnight for the Morey era but realistically Embiid has another 2 years before he requests out.</p>

      <label for="l9ch6i5" class="commentText"><p>Danny Green did an interview on the Rights to Ricky Sanchez podcast (a sixers pod), and he said something pretty similar on Paul George probably having heard bad things about Morey from Harden, and that mattering, and, furthermore, that players around the league don&rsquo;t trust Morey, and will be harder to convinced to come to Philly. The implication, in my opinion, was that you might have to pay them more or give them more contractual security to overcome their distrust, if they come to Philly at all.</p>

      <label for="l9dlira" class="commentText"><p>Ricky Sánchez was later traded to the Philadelphia 76ers on September 10, 2007. The 76ers traded the rights to Sánchez on March 15, 2012, for Memphis Grizzlies forward Sam Young. This move inspired the name of Michael Levin and Spike Eskin&rsquo;s Sixers podcast, &ldquo;Rights to Ricky Sanchez&rdquo;, commonly referred to as &ldquo;The Ricky&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="l9df22n" class="commentText"><p>I think it was 2018. Playoff game between Sixers and Celtics in Philly. Sixers were down 2 and one of their guys hit a buzzer beater 3 to &lsquo;win&rsquo; the game. Confetti pours down from the ceiling.</p>

<p>But by that point it had already become clear that his foot was on the 3 point line, and it was going to go to overtime. Refs confirmed it, so it was time to play 5 more minutes&hellip;</p>

<p>Except they had to delay the game until every single piece of confetti fell and got collected - player safety or whatever. So everyone got to chill and wait for a few minutes while making fun of the Sixers&rsquo; improperly timed confetti.</p>

<p>Of course, the Celtics would go on to win in overtime, eventually win that series, and later win a couple more series against the Sixers without dropping one. In retrospect, it was a big symbolic moment at the start of what has been a very one-sided not-quite-rivalry (Embiid&rsquo;s words).</p>

      <label for="l9d0948" class="commentText"><p>Oh this definitely sounds like him addressing the Sixers rumors. Morey’s done a lot for the sport and was a pioneer in using analytics, but his ego has prevented him from ever accomplishing anything significant. Now that his shine has worn off, I imagine a lot of players don’t want to work with him. No matter how good the basketball situation is for PG to go to Philly, the organization isn’t as soundly run as the Clippers even.</p>

<p>Put Nurse on a winning roster and he&rsquo;s a genius again because he&rsquo;s a great coach who expects a lot on the defensive end but when it results in wins it&rsquo;s always gonna be fine</p>

<p>There is so much you dont know. Nurse&rsquo;s wife for instance is a big anti-vax person and held a function in COVID for the team and some of the players got sick. The trust was already dwindling after that.</p>

James Harden, who is currently teammates with Paul George on the Clippers, famously had an ugly split with the 76ers. Putting the pieces together, Harden has clearly advised George not to sign with the 76ers and it seems George is taking that advice to heart.</p>

He has no intention of leaving LA and if he does even pretend to he&rsquo;s only going to do it to drive up his price. He&rsquo;s happy living in LA and getting knocked out in the first or second round of the playoffs every year. It&rsquo;s pretty clear. Anyone of Philly, Orlando, or OKC would be better for him going forward in terms of winning and they all have cap space. OKC could even clear their way to Max space if they wanted to. Maybe some of those teams don&rsquo;t want him, but if I was him I&rsquo;d be trying to deal with those three teams If I wanted to win a championship</p>
