<p>The above quote was taken from Paul George, presumably from an episode of Podcast P. Though I have not seen the video. I know I’m biased as a Harden and Rockets fan, but I truly don’t believe harden would be (possibly) in PGs ear if he wasn’t truly wronged. One of the nbas biggest mysteries imo.</p>

<p>Do you think this could potentially burn the sixers for future free agents?</p>

      <label for="l9cc0xy" class="commentText"><p>Reminded me of something Chris Paul said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I go over to the gym to go work out and Daryl call me…He said ‘I was just calling you to make sure you didn’t wanna go to OKC.’ I was like, ‘No, why I don’ moved 15 people to Houston.’ And he was like, ‘Okay I was just making sure.’ He was like ‘I would never trade you to somewhere you didn’t want to go because you chose to come to us from the Clippers,’”</p>

<p>“I chose to go to Houston from LA…I’m at the house chilling, I was on the phone with Jada [Chris’ wife] and next thing you know [the alert] said that I was getting traded [to OKC],</p>

<p>“And then my phone started ringing and it was Daryl calling. So I ain’t know…Daryl was like, ‘Hey man, it just moves so fast.’ I said, ‘It’s all good I just want you to tell me one thing. You said you wasn’t going to trade me, right?’ He said, ‘Yeah I said that but–’ I said, ‘That’s all I needed to know.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1b344xo/chris_paul_reveals_that_daryl_morey_lied_to_him/" target="_blank">source</a></p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s more to the quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“So as soon as Melo told me that (he was released) I got Jada my kids and we got up, I said Rudy (Gay) I gotta go. I went back to the hotel called Melo went to his room knocked on the door or what not, and I was in there with Melo for along time, a couple hours.</p>

<p>“<strong>And Melo was in tears and I know how much he gave to the game but throughout the whole process of him coming to Houston me and Melo would talk about… all this stuff, I never said this is going to happen or not going to happen. So he tells me what happens with Daryl and I was like what? He came in his room told him he’d get him a flight back to New York, how do you say this to this man? Some of the most disrespectful sh*t I seen</strong>&ldquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that PG teamed with Melo.</p>

He was in a crappy situation in Phoenix and the Celtics didn’t have 3 starting quality PGs. Phoenix was crazy when they assembled that 3 PG lineup.</p>

<p>IT and Porzingis had never been that deep in the playoffs before very late into their careers. If their bodies can physically allow them to he on that court in any capacity, they&rsquo;re going on that court.

His problem in every story seems to be that he wants to be buddy-buddy with the players, and that leads to a lot of yappin&rsquo; and making promises he can&rsquo;t keep.</p>

      <label for="l9depj1" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s lying though. You can sugar coat it, but it&rsquo;s lying. If I call you to tell you that I&rsquo;m not gonna sleep with your ex, and then call you back and say</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahh man someone gave me a million bucks to bang your ex, it just happened so quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure, most people would understand that it&rsquo;d be stupid for me NOT to do it. However when I told you I&rsquo;m not gonna do something, that doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna do it unless it&rsquo;s beneficial enough for me&rdquo;, it means &ldquo;under no circumstances am I gonna do it&rdquo;. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m lying.</p>

<p>He never has to even ask if he wants to go to OKC, he never has to state he wouldn’t trade him to a spot he doesn’t want to go to or bring up that he chose them over LAC. All of those are just leading CP3 into thinking he’s not going anywhere. You can say he’s not lying explicitly, but he absolutely mislead Chris with his intentions.</p>

<p>Is it shitty? Maybe, but this is a billion dollar business we’re talking about, fans would be pissed at their GM for not taking the best deal because “I told him I wouldn’t trade him there.”</p>

True or not. “I’m the smartest guy in the room and I know things and I’ve got your best interests at heart.” People leave those convos felling like they have their back and are looking out for them. That can get you a long way in the world. And sometimes it is true which builds their statue and legend. But eventually enough people will talk and trade stories of all the lies you told them and your new legend is that you’re full of shit and can’t be trusted.</p>

<p>Have worked with a couple of people like that. They always get found out as frauds.</p>

      <label for="l9d6g5t" class="commentText"><p>Assuming this to be the case, then yeah he did Harden dirty. But the mistake was making the promise in the first place. Philly fans (and possibly management) did not want a Harden max after the Boston series and Morey potentially closes Embiids window if that contract doesnt work out. So I don&rsquo;t think not giving the max was a mistake, assuming that he wouldn&rsquo;t of. He just shouldn&rsquo;t promise things he can&rsquo;t keep, as it&rsquo;s ruining his reputation.</p>

<p>In summer of 2022, Harden opted out of his <span class="math inline">\(47M player option and signed a \)</span>32M extension to give the Sixers flexibility to sign PJ Tucker. He lost out on $15M because Daryl promised him he would give him a max extension after.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s also not mentioning that there&rsquo;s speculation Morey tampered with Harden when he was on the Nets and convinced him not to sign an extension there and demand a trade to Philly. These are HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS Harden has lost out on because Morey&rsquo;s a sleazeball.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it happen to multiple teams but this season he was trashing the Celtics nearly all year and refused to give them almost any credit all season. Was weirdly negative anytime my C&rsquo;s won in the playoffs and all I kept thinking is &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be a journalist not a fan. Take your bias out of it dude&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9dyn2f" class="commentText"><p>On the one hand, that’s the model that made his boss the most famous/prominent sportswriter (or sports adjacent writer anyway) of his generation. On the other hand, Simmons clearly loved the stuff he was writing about, even if he was bashing someone. It was light, fun, and - this is critical - well written. Then there’s the difference that Simmons was so relatable for that generation. He was a voice that filled a void in sports media.</p>

<p>O’Connor had some thoughtful stuff and I used to read/listen occasionally, but he quickly felt like one of those “if you disagree with me you must know jackshit about basketball” kind of personalities. And while sure, he watches more basketball than I do - by a lot - it sure as hell doesn’t mean he’s right about everything. Most the other guys at The Ringer (and a few at other outlets) seem to have an air of both playfulness and reverence for the game in a way that he just doesn’t. It’s kind of a bummer. I’m sure he’s a decent guy and he is extremely dedicated to his craft/hoops, but I am just not a fan.</p>

There&rsquo;s no advantage and some possible disadvantages to Morey telling CP or Harden or Melo about his moves ahead of time. It&rsquo;s the way it is; it&rsquo;s the nature of the game.</p>

<p>When people ask Harden or CP about flopping or something, they&rsquo;re both like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s part of the game and as long as it&rsquo;s advantageous to do so, I&rsquo;ll do it. Make it illegal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s their shit, they&rsquo;re both cutthroat AF and only want to win. When a GM thinks that doing something that, in their eyes, gives the team the best chance to win and takes it at the player&rsquo;s detriment, all of a sudden they&rsquo;re like &ldquo;wait, there&rsquo;s a code.&rdquo;</p>

It&rsquo;s one thing for players to be mad at you for making a business decision, it&rsquo;s another for them to be mad that you lied to them. It may or may not impact his ability to do business with players in the future, but I think there is some small advantage to being a GM that is known to run an organization that is fair and open with players.</p>

Embiid has likely peaked as a player and is going to be eligible for a 3 year/200m extension in the off-season. It&rsquo;s going to be really interesting to see what happens if/when the Sixers lose before the ECF this upcoming year.</p>

      <label for="l9d09pz" class="commentText"><p>I disagree with the timeline. Joel Embiid loves Morey because Morey loves his stars. No matter what happens in the playoffs you know Daryll is going to offer Embiid max money no question even if the fans do a turn and want him gone. No matter how Joel feels about anything I think he’s concerned with securing the bag first and requesting out after he signs.</p>

<p>The only way that he isn’t offered a max is if they fire Morey after this season goes to shit. He has personally staked so much on this specific offseason that if they don’t make some major move then his tenure here is done. So yes potentially midnight for the Morey era but realistically Embiid has another 2 years before he requests out.</p>

      <label for="l9ch6i5" class="commentText"><p>Danny Green did an interview on the Rights to Ricky Sanchez podcast (a sixers pod), and he said something pretty similar on Paul George probably having heard bad things about Morey from Harden, and that mattering, and, furthermore, that players around the league don&rsquo;t trust Morey, and will be harder to convinced to come to Philly. The implication, in my opinion, was that you might have to pay them more or give them more contractual security to overcome their distrust, if they come to Philly at all.</p>

      <label for="l9df22n" class="commentText"><p>I think it was 2018. Playoff game between Sixers and Celtics in Philly. Sixers were down 2 and one of their guys hit a buzzer beater 3 to &lsquo;win&rsquo; the game. Confetti pours down from the ceiling.</p>

<p>But by that point it had already become clear that his foot was on the 3 point line, and it was going to go to overtime. Refs confirmed it, so it was time to play 5 more minutes&hellip;</p>

<p>Except they had to delay the game until every single piece of confetti fell and got collected - player safety or whatever. So everyone got to chill and wait for a few minutes while making fun of the Sixers&rsquo; improperly timed confetti.</p>

<p>Of course, the Celtics would go on to win in overtime, eventually win that series, and later win a couple more series against the Sixers without dropping one. In retrospect, it was a big symbolic moment at the start of what has been a very one-sided not-quite-rivalry (Embiid&rsquo;s words).</p>

      <label for="l9e7q0e" class="commentText"><p>I can’t really see this impacting the Sixers much. NBA contracts are generally fully guaranteed so perhaps players will no longer enter into handshake agreements with Morey, but not many players were doing that anyway.  Maxey was supposedly promised a max contract this offseason in lieu of signing an extension last offseason amid all of the Harden turmoil and still trusted the Sixers enough to wait.</p>

<p>There is so much you dont know. Nurse&rsquo;s wife for instance is a big anti-vax person and held a function in COVID for the team and some of the players got sick. The trust was already dwindling after that.</p>

      <label for="l9d7jjd" class="commentText"><p>I brought it up because it seems the most likely options are either re-sign with the knicks or go to the Sixers (for more money if the knicks wont match). The point I am making is I don&rsquo;t think Nurse being a tough coach is a deterrent when the other option is Thibs, which was what the original poster was trying to say.</p>

      <label for="l9d0948" class="commentText"><p>Oh this definitely sounds like him addressing the Sixers rumors. Morey’s done a lot for the sport and was a pioneer in using analytics, but his ego has prevented him from ever accomplishing anything significant. Now that his shine has worn off, I imagine a lot of players don’t want to work with him. No matter how good the basketball situation is for PG to go to Philly, the organization isn’t as soundly run as the Clippers even.</p>

      <label for="l9d6fnf" class="commentText"><p>If PG does end up going to Philly, it&rsquo;s a different situation because he&rsquo;d have his contract up front.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there were things that Morey could have done better in the Harden situation, but anyone that genuinely believes that Harden leaked the Houston news on Christmas (at the literal height of the Harden Sixers tenure when they were considered one of the top teams) then immediately hired an agent for the first time since his last negotiable contract all well having a backroom agreed to deal already in place, then I don&rsquo;t even know what to say.  Everything he did that year was in line with somebody that was playing for a new contract and didn&rsquo;t have shit locked in.  Shit, him even exploring other teams with this supposed promised deal is hypocritical as hell and would make him a liar too, so that bit didn&rsquo;t even make sense.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying Morey is perfect, but the James Harden situation in Philly is not a great example to go by.  Nobody knows what truly happened, but there&rsquo;s more reason to believe that Harden&rsquo;s ego was bruised more than Morey&rsquo;s word was broken.</p>
