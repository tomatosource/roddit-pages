      <p>We’ve seen multiple times that good regular season teams with one big star often struggle in the playoffs later. OKC with Russ 2017 come to mind as he was the only one who could create his points by himself.</p>

<p>Shai can do that at OKC, however don’t they need a second star? J Williams is good, but is he someone you wanna take a shot late in the game in iso? The other players are mainly role players who take assisted shots (Joe, Holmgren for example).</p>

<p>He has shown to be very capable during last season. I expect him to be mentally better prepared this year in the playoffs.</p>

This should give him plenty opportunity to create more off of the dribble. I can see his game turning into something like jaylen brown. A big strong wing capable of turning the corner and finishing over most defenders. I&rsquo;m interested to see if he&rsquo;ll develop any sort of pull up game with consistency.</p>

<p>Jdub was one of the most clutch players last year in the entire NBA and had multiple go ahead shots in the final minutes including a game winner</p>

<p>Regardless, yes we need a second option. But yes, Jdub and maybe Chet were pretty close to that as rookie/sophomores so the bet is they develop</p>

      <label for="lkbtiln" class="commentText"><p>I would be cool with jdub doing that personally. I think he is very very capable. Chet would be the next option and he is quite comfortable as well  creating his own looks, especially now that he will be playing the 4 and will have even bigger size mismatches to take advantage of.</p>

      <label for="lkbuwh0" class="commentText"><p>I get what you&rsquo;re saying, but the reality is while they don&rsquo;t really have a true second option as a elite self-creating score, their second and third option are both much closer to being that than they have any right to be as rookie&rsquo;s/ sophomores.</p>

<p>If both guys stall or for some crazy reason, take a step back in that department this season. They could maybe look into using some of their assets to hunt for a guy like that. Because with a lot of the CBA changes I think the thunders time to push for a championship really is the next 2 or 3 years.</p>

<p>But their roster is still just so damn young. I think it&rsquo;s pretty reasonable to expect Chet and Williams to improve a good deal and if they do, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll have too many issues Come play off time</p>

      <label for="lkbyw0d" class="commentText"><p>Dub is that guy, he&rsquo;ll be better by the time the playoffs roll around this year.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting how his offensive struggles related to the Mavs basically ignoring the fifth shooter so they could get an extra body on the baseline ready to help in the paint. That&rsquo;s obviously a good idea when you&rsquo;re doing it against Giddey, but was a bit of a gamble on guys like Dort and Chet, who shot way below their regular season numbers in that series. Run that back swapping Caruso for Giddey and the shot variance game looks very different.</p>

<p>Either way, this is the thing with them not wanting to go all in and rush next year - the key secondary offensive pieces have a combined three seasons of on-court experience and were 22 and 21. Just need a little seasoning.</p>
