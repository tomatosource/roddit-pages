<p>Phrasing it like that leads me to believe that there is a deal out there that can be had — that they believe that they can do — but it might not be received favorably, particularly by the Bulls fanbase.</p>

<p>If you can move off the Lavine contract, great. There’s no need to panic and give up other assets to do so. This team isn’t going anywhere soon anyway (and actually needs to be bottom 10 this season to keep our pick). If he’s really such a negative trade asset, just eat the salary for a season or 2 until it’s a more movable short term deal. You can move virtually anyone on an expiring</p>

<p>Lots of people are also pointing to what they could have gotten at the trade deadline but a pick in this draft doesn’t seem to be worth more than Giddey.</p>

<p>I don’t think Giddey is that good, but I think he’ll develop to be better than Caruso so I believe they’re better off developing him and flip him for more in a few years.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Then you don&rsquo;t think Caruso is that good? Because to me the odds Giddey ends up being a top 40ish player   seem incredibly low. Caruso is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league who hit 40% of his threes on a career high in volume. Who cares if he develops any more, he&rsquo;s already very very good.</p>

<p>Not a great trade, and Caruso maybe could have been dealt sooner for a better return, but I also don&rsquo;t think this trade is terrible. Bulls should just go all in on tanking and hope for some luck in the next draft.</p>

<p>AKME used eeeeeeverything to put this roster together and it would have been nice to get one of OKC&rsquo;s picks. It would help in either a Lavine deal or in a rebuild.</p>

<p>Trading Caruso may allow us to keep our top-10 protected pick in a big draft. We need to tank and he was our entire defense. Now we just need DeMar to move on or all of this was for nothing.</p>

      <label for="la91uop" class="commentText"><p>it’s a sickening, yet entirely expected, level of cope from a fan base that accepts &amp; embraces perpetual mediocracy because they had major success 30 years ago &amp; a flash in the pan with D-Rose.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, this is a team full of somewhat talented players that are largely irrelevant contributors to winning basketball. DeRozen is going to get re-signed for a lot of money because this front office is terrified of the attention that comes with being true rebuilders (because they can’t make a good pick to save their lives). Lavine is pretty much completely worthless as both a winning basketball player &amp; as a trade asset. Vooch forgot how to play basketball. Patrick Williams is one of the most forgettable high lottery picks in recent memory. Like the team that drafted him, he is so mediocre as to almost become invisible.</p>

<p>Coby White &amp; Ayo look like they could be dynamic high-end role players. So rather than invest &amp; grow the only legitimately exciting young talent on the team, AK decides it’s time to trade an asset (who was worth multiple first rounders at the deadline) for a player that provides no value unless he is taking the ball away from the two aforementioned players. It’s an incredible move really because not only does this hurt the Bull’s chances of developing future contributors to winning basketball, it also effectively neuters their two best trade assets by deflating their ability to contribute.</p>

<p>Mediocrity masterclass from the most average &amp; complacent front office in sports. Trading a player OKC needed &amp; coming back with zero draft picks should be a fireable offense.</p>

      <label for="la89p3x" class="commentText"><p>How do people think there&rsquo;s no way they win that trade? Caruso is wasted on the current state of their team. Giddey is 21 and already shown a lot of promise and could easily bounce back. The only other offers we&rsquo;ve heard about are later lottery picks in this draft that everyone is shitting on.</p>

<p>If Giddey gets back to what he was that was a good trade.</p>

      <label for="la8ci9w" class="commentText"><p>I agree with everything you’re saying except “get back to what he was.” Giddey’s first two years are really overrated because of the counting stats. The scoring inefficiency and defense were killer. It’s not the end of the world because he’s young, but this is a guy who’s really good passing and good on the glass and pretty much nothing else, and so of course the rebounding and assist numbers look good. You have to look at the whole picture with Giddey, True shooting, lineup data, and not just the counting stats, which will obviously bounce back with increased minutes and usage. The bulls are banking on real improvement and if you look at his March you can definitely see some.</p>

The biggest difference is Westbrook’s insane athleticism always gave him a lot of scoring gravity and he got to the line and finished at the rim. Giddey doesn’t draw much attention when he drives right now, which makes it hard to make plays.</p>

It only got awful if the player was basically retired with injury like Wall or Kemba. Lavine would&rsquo;ve been a desirable target for some contender looking to add a no. <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> before the 2nd apron was introduced. Now, teams are reconsidering the value of this level of players at a max because the penalty is more than just paying the tax. We saw it with Denver where MPJ and Murray both being on maxes hamstrings them unless one of them consistently performs like an All-NBA player in the postseason.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t lose for nothing when you&rsquo;re not paying the tax means you don&rsquo;t actually lose for nothing. You lose for cap space, which is not nothing. You can debate what cap space is actually worth, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth more than a guy you have to attach more assets to get off your books.</p>

      <label for="la97vse" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s with hindsight, he didn&rsquo;t really have injury issues at the time and was coming off back to back all star seasons. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine a reality where he remains a strong positive asset this year and they would have been licking themselves for letting him walk for nothing.</p>

<p>Edit: and the biggest thing hampering his value other than injuries (which you couldn&rsquo;t have predicted) is the apron system in the new CBA which wouldn&rsquo;t be agreed to for over a year when Lavine signed his deal. Unless you knew ahead of time that suddenly fringe all stars on max contracts were going to go from basically market value to some of the worst contracts in basketball, there was no reason to think this was going to age poorly.</p>

<p>I got on other comment talking about how the Bulls nuked Lavine value so they can’t even try this path, the basically wanted to shop him since last year.</p>

<p>Too many reports about it so team don’t bother to make an appealing offer, Lavine is also signed with Klutch and his input is so far Blake lol</p>

      <label for="la8owrd" class="commentText"><p>Many people seem to make the case that the Bulls should have traded Caruso and Lavine together, but couldn&rsquo;t that same logic work for White and Lavine? White obviously isn&rsquo;t the same pedigree as Caruso, but he&rsquo;s still a good player who&rsquo;s outplaying his contract, which has two more seasons on it. If the Bulls trade them together, they seemingly get a better return than just Lavine and also remove any concerns about Giddey and White playing together.</p>

He&rsquo;s at the very cap friendly <span class="math inline">\(7M and \)</span>7.5M over the next two years (no options either way), so maybe they sell him high and Lavine low together, and hope that gets a decent return in either more complimentary players or picks. Giddey by itself is a fine trade, but like you said, with the Bulls current roster it does seem like an odd fit that would seemingly make people think it&rsquo;s just the first of multiple trades.</p>

      <label for="la8afvy" class="commentText"><p>They already lost what was probably the easiest trade for them to win. People have wanted Caruso for a while. Not only was it straight-up a bad trade but people interested in Caruso would be people who think Caruso is one of, if not the one, missing piece to their championship hopes. So the Bulls should have had a huge amount of leverage. LaVine is a big contract for a guy with injury problems. There&rsquo;s way less leverage there.</p>

<p>If you mean just get a better return for Caruso, the issue with that was probably that the teams who really wanted him are those hunting for a championship, like you said. That means late picks, or picks far in the future.</p>

Then when 3 people guard him having drawn the defense he never passes to the multiple open teammates and still tries to score thru all 3 tho he is completely covered.</p>

<p>Then after arguing with the ref and slowly moping up the court his man gets an easy layup on the other end.</p>

<p>So over it too. He is so dumb. You would think after this happening 100s (1000s?) of times the lightbulb would go off. Nope. I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion he is a complete box of rocks. I think the rest if the league knows this too.</p>

<p>Depends. Are you trading LaVine for draft capital, and either letting DeMar walk or sign and trade for younger prospects and trading Vuc for whatever you can get? Or are you getting scraps for LaVine so you can continue to run the mediocrity treadmill until DD and Vuc retire or request out?</p>

      <label for="la9h6tm" class="commentText"><p>This is terrific news if you’re a bulls fan. Front office is signaling that they’re ready to dump Lavine, which means the Bulls are ready to enter a rebuild. Caruso was just the first domino. If the Bulls can get a marginal first round draft pick for next years draft to dump Lavine’s albatross contract I’d consider that a huge win.</p>

<p>The question is whether you keep Derozan as a tank commander/veteran or let him go pursue a chip in LA and maybe try and sign and trade for salary dump/expiring veterans.</p>

<p>Can Vuc be dumped for a late pick in this years draft? Surely there’s a desperate contender (Lakers?) who would take a flyer on Vuc in exchange for a useless draft pick. Question is what they send back to fill salary.</p>

<p>Keep: Dosunmo, Coby, Pat Williams</p>

<p>Bulls are back. P Giddey baby. Breaking the Chicago point guard curse.</p>
