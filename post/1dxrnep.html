      <label for="lc4dh4b" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re entirely right but also the down votes seem harsh, it was pretty risky at the time. Obviously Kyrie is one of the best modern scoring guards in the league and they didn&rsquo;t give up too much but his availability and comitment at thay point were massive question marks. Normally I say commitment issues are always o erblown but as a raptors fan I gotta admit they are real.</p>

      <label for="lc41s6t" class="commentText"><p>It says it all that they suddenly remembered that trade grade after a lot of other things happened lol. Suddenly it was THEN so obvious, yeah makes sense to just remember it now.</p>

<p>Dallas&rsquo; level was definitely below Reddit&rsquo;s expectations after that trade. Later (about a year later!) they became much better when they changed OTHER things and became a top defense, but there is no sane reason to be sure that getting Irving was particularly crucial to that happening.</p>

<p>The picks offered are in 2029&hellip; of course it&rsquo;s easy to laugh at giving them out now. Whether people will always think that Kyrie Irving was the best option in the whole NBA to give up the assets for&hellip; we&rsquo;ll see. As far as I know the sub, after a good game it will be yes for everyone here, and after a bad game it will be a no for everyone.</p>

<p>Irving had good 2024 playoffs and helped Dallas make the finals, so the value was big at the moment. But the year and a half overall is mostly indeed a proof that it wasn&rsquo;t as obvious.</p>

He only really needed to be an above average starting PG to justify the contract.</p>

<p>Obviously, he&rsquo;s even more reasonably paid than that now, and it&rsquo;s also obvious it was one of the best free agent contracts in recent memory, but it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that the criticism of the signing was dumb as hell <strong><em>at the time</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this today and I kinda feel that Wemby (assuming good health) runs into the issue the Mavs had where he’s too good to finish tanking and you start pushing for the playoffs sooner than later.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, I wonder if the FO lets it play out, or if they trade off the vets for more capital.</p>

They can actually afford to push for a play-in run this yr + playoff runs every other yr after that cause they got plenty of other teams to do the tanking for them.</p>

<p>Wright has been criticized heavily by our fans but I think people are starting to realize that they actually do have a plan in place to avoid the issues the OG LeBron Cavs faced</p>

      <label for="lc4lonx" class="commentText"><p>In all honesty I doubt CP3 finishes the season with the spurs. I wouldn’t be surprised if CP3 has a handshake deal with the spurs to be shopped at the deadline to a contender. He’ll help mentor and develop our young guys while simultaneously showing he still has value as a starter playing meaningful mins with probably the leagues easiest lob target. He’ll probably average 12-13 assists and could be traded to a contender who needs depth or an extra push in the playoffs. Spurs get the mentorship and whatever the return they’ll get for that trade which I can very well see being a 2031 lakers first or something similar. Barnes on the other hand has more value. It’s no secret 2025 was the draft we were targeting. I think that offseason is where we will make a move. Maybe using some of that war chest to bring in a star or good experienced role players to give wemby his first real shot at the playoffs. For that we will need salary matching. Him and Collins being decent expiring contracts will be a big help in getting some great pieces next year.</p>

      <label for="lc3scpx" class="commentText"><p>It’s a great return for sure. I think anyone doubting any part of it is just wondering why Spurs don’t tank one more year developing young guys (including the 8th pick they didn’t keep) for one more shot at a core piece of the future with an early pick and what appears to be a loaded draft.</p>

<p>I’m not sure which end of it I’m on yet, but this trade is too much to turn down no matter your plan for next season.</p>

They also have a slim chance at two more protected first next year, three other future firsts, a handful of swaps and a dozen second round picks. They&rsquo;re more likely to fall into the OKC space of not having enough roster/cap space to keep everyone than they are needing to have tanked another year, especially when they have several young players that need to be developing into good successful players in the next season or two.</p>

He had the worst defensive rating on the team and by far the least defensive win shares in the starting lineup. Demar was at worst the 3rd best defender in the bulls starting lineup that had a defensive rating of 109. So both the kings and bulls were pretty good defensively with their starting lineup and we got rid of our worse defender for the bulls 3rd best defender.</p>

You could also say he&rsquo;s the 3rd worst defender in our starting lineup, and I&rsquo;d say he literally <em>is</em> our 3rd worst defender this season if you exclude 20 games of Zach.</p>

<p>Ayo, Caruso, Craig, Carter, Pat, Drummond, Green, Bitim, Terry, Phillips are probably all better defenders than Demar. That&rsquo;s the rotation except for Zach, Coby, and Vuc. It&rsquo;s a bad thing we were a bottom 10 defense this season without Zach.</p>

      <label for="lc4gyet" class="commentText"><p>Look, I know better than anyone about how bad Playoff HB is and was, but Derozan may just be the worst playoff performer in basketball history. Derozan consistently gets held to shooting percentages sub-40% in the playoffs. You&rsquo;re also giving up a guy with an eFG% of 57.6% for a guy with an eFG% of 50.7%, going from 38.7% from 3 on 5 attempts to 33.3% on 1 attempt per game which should kill your spacing. Derozan also hasn&rsquo;t hit a single three-point shot in his last three playoff series. It&rsquo;s not nearly so clean-cut.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a talent upgrade but it&rsquo;s one that I don&rsquo;t feel confident will work out even before factoring in the potential for DeMar to age out poorly in Sacramento.</p>

      <label for="lc4iv8f" class="commentText"><p>Fit is important - even very important. But it isn&rsquo;t everything. The Kings just experienced a <em>major</em> talent upgrade. The Harrison Barnes of even two seasons ago isn&rsquo;t the Barnes of today- he&rsquo;s no longer the efficient 15-16 ppg player with a solid all around game that he was. He&rsquo;ll surprise you occasionally and can still hit an open 3. He&rsquo;s still efficient, but he&rsquo;s good for maybe 12 a game at this point and he has an awful habit of disappearing completely and having no impact whatsoever on a game. His D is no longer useful. He&rsquo;s a purely complementary player at this stage and not one who moves the needle.</p>

<p>Now maybe Derozan falls off due to age but as of the latest evidence we have he&rsquo;s a wildly superior scorer. He&rsquo;s still nicely efficient despite creating most of his own offense. He doesn&rsquo;t address defensive deficiencies but he doesn&rsquo;t really make them worse either, while giving us a serious scoring punch.</p>

<p>I know of very few examples where highly talented teams struggled solely due to fit. Most of the examples people bring up actually <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> that talented, and their fit issues are talent issues as much as they are fit. The Lakers could use more shooters, but if their third best guy was significantly better than Reaves/Russell they&rsquo;d be a much better team. Westbrook is frequently described as a bad fit with teams (and he is) but his real issue is simply that he&rsquo;s not very good anymore.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see how it goes. But if the Kings stay healthy I&rsquo;m looking for at least 4-5 more wins this season.</p>

<p>Feels like most fans seem to be in agreement that this was an overall solid move for the Kings, but almost every trade grade I&rsquo;ve seen has been thoroughly negative on the king side of things and a very doubtful and dubious on the fit.</p>

      <label for="lc3t4vt" class="commentText"><p>The difference is that Kings fans watched their team last season. I don&rsquo;t expect people outside of Sacramento to know that defense wasn&rsquo;t the Kings biggest issue last year. Their issue was that thet didn&rsquo;t have somebody that could take on the offensive load if Fox was having a bad game. Their reliance on 3 pointers to win a game was also a huge problem. If the 3s didn&rsquo;t fall, they had nobody aside from Fox and Monk to get a bucket.</p>

<p>I welcome DD and should make the Kings games I go to regularly more entertaining knowing at minimum one of Fox/DD/Monk will be on the floor creating at all times.</p>

<p>And this sub seems to think it&rsquo;s still 2020 when they think of Harrison Barnes, dude kinda sucks now.</p>

      <label for="lc4ipfv" class="commentText"><p>Most of the fans on reddit talking about it would be Kings fans, so they&rsquo;re very invested in this being a good trade. The people who are writing about the trade in the media are people who have watched a lot of the Bulls and the Raptors with Derozan at the helm. So Kings fans want to be optimistic and they see this as addressing a hole in their offense and dumping an unpopular player for somebody of greater talent. National media see this as Sacramento swinging for a &lsquo;star&rsquo; of questionable value and terrible peripherals that they&rsquo;ve seen fail over and over again in Toronto and Chicago. Time will tell, but unless Derozan suddenly learned how to shoot 3s and play defense I&rsquo;m not moved by it.</p>

      <label for="lc3okhr" class="commentText"><p>What are you talking about. The Spurs just got a starting caliber small forward who plays a position of need and has a skill set of need for pretty much absolutely nothing. In fact they got paid to take said starting small forward.</p>

<p>People like to clown pick swaps but with both the Spurs and thunder loading up on them (those two teams combined own half of all the pic swaps currently out there) It seems almost guaranteed there&rsquo;s going to be at least one situation where one of those two teams ends up getting a high lottery pick while simultaneously having a winning season.</p>

<p>Teams are giving out those as assets, particularly far into the future, way too easily and It seems like a sure thing. Some organizations going to end up with egg on their face When it&rsquo;s all said and done.</p>

<p>San Antonio has so much flexibility. Again, I have no clue how you don&rsquo;t view this as an A plus. It&rsquo;s an expiring contract going into Victor&rsquo;s last year of his rookie deal, and they&rsquo;re going to have a ridiculous amount of space opening up, and the team has plenty of young talent to still kick the tires on over the next 12 months while possessing&hellip;</p>

<p>An unprotected 25. Hawks pick, unprotected 26. Hawks pig swap, unprotected Hawks 27 Pick, top 10/top eight protected bulls pick starting in 25 to 27, lottery protected 25. Hornets pick, top one protected 28 Celtics pick swap, unprotected Mavericks 30 Pic swap, top one protected Timberwolves 30 pig swap, Timberwolves unprotected 31 pick, Kings unprotected 31 pic swap AND something around 20 sound picks in the next 7 years, AND All of their own pics AND And extremely clean cap sheet.</p>

<p>This is an A+ trade for the Spurs because it&rsquo;s just a continued and growing trend of them adding more assets, for when the moment comes for them to swing for another star, for literally no cost to themselves. They did the same thing last year getting an unprotected swap.</p>

<p>Even if your view is that the Spurs need to when now that takes nothing away from the fact that this was A situation where they didn&rsquo;t give up anything and added two pieces of value, a solid short-term player, and a potentially very valuable long-term asset.</p>

<p>Look, Barnes will be a good addition to the Spurs, they needed more vets.</p>

<p>Dude is a bottom 10 starting SF at this point in his career and anyone who bothered watching the Kings last season, for more than the few games he&rsquo;d randomly drop 25 on hot shooting, would know that.</p>

      <label for="lc42fgg" class="commentText"><p>I watched a good amount of Kings games the last couple years. I&rsquo;m under no illusion about what quality of player he is.</p>

<p>The thing is if Barnes is a bottom 10 starting small forward in the league, which I think is up For debate&hellip;</p>

<p>Then the guy he&rsquo;s replacing Julian Champaignie Is without a doubt a bottom three, with a very very good case to be made that he was the worst consistent starter at that position in the entire NBA last year. He probably would not have gotten third string minutes on <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the league&rsquo;s roster. And I like Julian and  I root for him but at this point in his career he&rsquo;s a borderline NBA player</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a massive massive upgrade that cost San Antonio pretty much nothing and gave them yet another draft asset. People are underselling h then you give me just the ow valuable that swap could be that far out</p>

      <label for="lc3nr37" class="commentText"><p>A lot of it has to do with the logistics of the new salary caps rules and the second apron. Spurs are taking a long term approach to remain competitive over an extended period of time despite the new cap rules.</p>

      <label for="lc3q0ot" class="commentText"><p>They got paid a pick to get a starting forward which adds spacing to let Castle and Wemby get easier looks and reps. The pick is also pretty good and will probably be traded in the future for complimentary pieces once the main core of the team is ready.</p>

<p>They gave up nothing and got 2 valueable things back.</p>
