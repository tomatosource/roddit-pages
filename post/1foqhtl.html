      <label for="loru3au" class="commentText"><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo was never the best player in the league and is extremely overrated. The man was an opponent ankle injury away from being James Harden/Joel Embiid 2.0. If not for that, his greatest playoff series win would&rsquo;ve been beating the 2019 Kamikaze Kyrie Celtics. He can certainly be the best player on a championship team, but there was never a time where he was the first guy you pick (all other things being equal) to lead a team to the championship.</p>

      <label for="lorww2r" class="commentText"><p>Giannis was fucking them up in that series, outside of game 2. The Nets stayed competitive despite their injuries because 1) KD was a god and 2) the rest of the Bucks were <em>fucking terrible</em>.</p>

<p>That whole series is the clearest example I’ve ever seen of people looking at names on a box score instead of watching actual games. Middleton was great in our three home games and outside of that (plus Kyrie playing half the series, which often seems to be forgotten) there was <em>very</em> little difference in the quality of KD and Giannis’ support casts despite the significantly higher pedigree we had. Jrue couldn’t buy a bucket, Middleton was terrible in the Brooklyn games, Lopez and Portis were getting played off the floor, Tucker couldn’t stop KD if his life depended on it and so on.</p>

      <label for="lorxmak" class="commentText"><p>I’m not though. Watch the games, he was really good throughout that series except for the one game in which we did actually get blown out. Because everybody else on the team also sucked so hard that if he had a bad game it turned into a 40 point loss.</p>

<p>Based on the actual quality of their play in that series aside from three Middleton games (all of which we won, because that’s what happens when Giannis got actual support and KD didn’t), which Bucks player would you say was any better than their Nets counterpart?</p>

      <label for="lorv5dz" class="commentText"><p>Yup, that&rsquo;s my primary reason (which I should&rsquo;ve elaborated more on). His offensive game is too flawed and not versatile enough to lead a consistent, high level offence. Yeah, he can shred through teams not equipped to defend him, but if he can&rsquo;t just bulldoze his way to the rim your offence is fucked. He can&rsquo;t shoot for shit and can&rsquo;t even hit free throws. We&rsquo;ve routinely seen Milwaukee&rsquo;s offence just completely collapse for long stretches in which he was unable to bail them out like an actual offensive superstar could have. I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s no excuse for some of Milwaukee&rsquo;s dire offensive playoff meltdown sequences, but there actually is because Giannis is not equipped to consistently bail the team out of those.</p>

There’s always been a negative narrative around this guy.

      <label for="losbzha" class="commentText"><p>I would argue he doesn’t have a chip mostly because his prime years were dominated by the Spurs/Warriors/Lebron, KD wouldn’t have one either if he didn’t join Golden State.</p>

<p>I won’t argue with his inefficieny because yeah it’s always been a problem, but there are a lot of guys out there who are worse in the playoffs than regular season. Embiid, Harden, even Curry for many years. Jason Kidd  for instance shot under 40% for his playoff career and I rarely hear people talk about him like they do Russ.</p>

      <label for="lorxax6" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem and Duncan(it seems like Duncan is getting more flak for it recently) are overrated offensively. I don’t really think they are overrated as players or how their careers are viewed, but I don’t think people understand that the majority of their value is coming from their defense.</p>

<p>They’ve never been great playmakers, efficient scorers, or even good spacers/shooters. When they won as the offensive centerpieces their relative playoff offenses are in the bottom percentile for championship teams.</p>

<p>I just want to say for Hakeem especially people only look that two years he won but ignore the other years of his career where he was a complete black hole. The two years they won, Hakeem had the advantage of having amazing spacing for his era, which I think really helped his scoring and playmaking look better.</p>

<p>Edit: Also while they lost that series Hakeem averaged 37 PPG/16.8 RPG/2.3 Steals/2.8 blocks in the 1988 first round series</p>

      <label for="los17wp" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem’s best trait offensively is his ability to score in high volume, he’s had many playoff series with big scoring.</p>

<p>The issue is that he often didn’t take great shots so his efficiency wasn’t there a lot of the time, when he makes them it looks great and he’s able to be efficient but most of the time that wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>And pretty much until his two championship years he was consistently averaging more turnovers than assists in the playoffs, as a guy that’s viewed as an offensive centerpiece type player that’s really not too great. His defense is otherworldly though of course.</p>

<p>Who cares he’s a center. Shaq did that multiple times in his career. Duncan did that multiple times in his career. Patrick Ewing did that his entire career. Alonzo Mourning did that his entire career. Moses Malone did that his entire career.</p>

<p>Hakeem was a turnover machine in the early parts of his career, of course it’s relevant when you’re talking about how good he was offensively.</p>

<p>With someone like Shaq he was very efficient for his time and he was able to effective as an off-ball force and created shots for his teammates that way. He’s been the centerpiece of many great offenses, even before Kobe reached his prime.</p>

<p>Then you claimed:</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;ve changed your viewpoint to &ldquo;Hakeem was efficient, but he&rsquo;s not quite peak Shaq, the most monstrous offensive force in NBA history&rdquo; lmao</p>

<p>Even then you are wrong - peak efficiency for peak efficiency: Shaq&rsquo;s highest ever TS% playoff run is .604 in 1998 (13 games), several points below Hakeem&rsquo;s highest ever at .659 in 1987 (10 games).</p>

<p>Anthony Davis is similar to this in that he has a great PPG and TS% but his offensive impact metrics always lag behind to the extent that he&rsquo;s easily more valuable on defense</p>

<p>The main exception to this would be someone like Shaq who was so absurdly strong in the post that he could playmake in another way by getting triple teamed constantly</p>

<p>The mans better than Shai and more durable than Embid, yet his shot selection sucks so bad that it makes me cringe and thats why he ends up looking worse than he should.</p>

      <label for="los5dpk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I saw a statistic that showed how as Tatum got more muscular, his 3 point shooting efficiency went down with it.</p>

<p>Now i think it might have been because he took more 3s than before, but in general i think the Celtics need him to attack the rim far more than shoot 3s.</p>

<p>Look at the Mavs series and how well that worked for them.</p>

<p>Even though he wasnt making his shots, he got some dam good looks for his other guys.</p>

<p>If the Celtics have 1 flaw as a team, is that they live and die by their 3 point shooting and Tatum being more agreesive could make them not be vulnerable to shot variance.</p>

      <label for="los87tb" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. I know Kobe is his idol but honestly he should be trying to do a version of Miami era LeBron instead (any era of LeBron tbh). His size, body, and current skill set lend itself far more to play like that. He’s a truly great playmaker for a 6’9” guy, he’s almost always stronger than his matchup, he’s got a great handle, can defend 1-5, and is easily the best rebounding SF since Carmelo. He plays like he’s Kobe/carmelo but if he played more like LeBron he’d be unstoppable. Especially since he’s a better shooter than LeBron is fundamentally speaking.</p>

      <label for="los79g9" class="commentText"><p>Not to hijack but considering how things have played out, KD&rsquo;s rep would be   better if he stayed in GS (if not by much).  That core was running the league and there wasn&rsquo;t really a team on the horizon to challenge them when healthy, which is real reason for all the hate.  Just like the Bulls, Lakers, and Celtics of eras past, fans respect greatness after it stops kicking their team&rsquo;s ass.  If everything else played out the same, the Warriors PR machine does it&rsquo;s thing so public opinion probably shifts more in his favor over time, KD wins in 2022 (and his rep doesn&rsquo;t take the hit from Steph winning another ring without him), and he doesn&rsquo;t have the Brooklyn tenure on his resume.</p>

<p>To say there’s no teams to challenge them when healthy is too presumptuous, it’s hard to believe the Warriors would have stayed healthy after so many runs. Elite big man play also started popping up again after 2019, the Lakers, Nuggets and Bucks all match up well vs. Golden State even with KD because of their lack of bigs.</p>

      <label for="lorxw7z" class="commentText"><p>No one does no.  You asked for opinions that is different from common perceptions.</p>

<p>Basketball is a team game and people are obsessed with who the #1 option is.  But Denver lost in the playoffs this year despite having the &ldquo;best&rdquo; #1 option in the MVP Jokic mostly because their #2 Murray played not to his best self.  I think in the grand scheme of all time greats, they all have #2 guys who enable them or play well off them and that&rsquo;s how you win titles.  MJ had Pippen.  Lebron had AD/Kyrie.  Malone had Stockton.  Guys who win titles usually have a #2 who&rsquo;s very, very good and it be interesting to discuss who the best #2 option guys are all time because I think it&rsquo;s a nice list.  There&rsquo;s just not a lot of history of 1 superstar teams winning multiple titles - they all get help.</p>

<p>The reality of the list though is that a lot of guys transition based on different points in their career.  Like the Admiral was a #1 option for years, but then deferred a bit to Duncan in the later stages of his career to win a title.</p>

<p>Many people, especially those who don’t watch games often, still stick with the narrative that he’s injury prone. They say he can’t finish a season healthy, chokes under pressure and isn’t someone a team should build around</p>

<p>He’s my favorite player so I’m biased but he played in 70 games this past year, played in all but one game during the latter half of the season, averaged 28.5 post all star break, dropped 40 on the Lakers before tearing his hamstring</p>

<p>I can say the same thing about Ja Morant. Everybody know him due to all the suspensions, off court stuff, but when he’s healthy, he’s legitimately one of the best players out there</p>

      <label for="los9pzs" class="commentText"><p>Booker has been getting overrated for years now because of his “pure hooper” reputation. I couldn’t agree more. In 2021 Beal, Lavine, Mitchell and Booker were all the exact same level of player and were virtually tied for 2nd best 2 guard behind harden. While Lavine and Beal fell off, Mitchell and Booker have maybe <em>slightly improved</em>?</p>

<p>In an nba setting he’s a poor defender, a poor playmaker, and a very good scorer. He’s vastly overrated as a shooter (if I’m not mistaken he’s never shot above league average from 3, could be wrong tho. He regularly hovers around 34% which is below average for a volume shooter today). He gets lumped in with elite scorers but he’s never averaged more than 27 in today’s era, which is crazy. Even before he shared the ball with KD. He can’t even sniff top 5 in league scoring.</p>

<p>I don’t even hate the guy, I actually like him, but this idea of him ever being a top 10 player is baffling to me. He’s comfortably a top 15-20 guy, and that’s fine. I think Jaylen brown is without question a better and more viable player than Booker is, he’s just as good of a scorer but in better shooting while also being an all world defender. I think ant is also unquestionably better.</p>

Mitchell also became a more efficient scorer.</p>

<p>Beal and Lavine made 0 improvements since 2021 and injuries made them play worse. Beal and Lavine are not anywhere close to Mitchell and Booker anymore.</p>

<p>I felt that Adrian Dantley was an equal to Isiah Thomas and that he was just as great of a player as Thomas was.</p>

<p>He played extremely hard on both sides of the ball each night, hustled every game, was extremely effective, consistent, and of course efficient, shared the ball, had his teammates back against any opponent, provided great leadership no matter what the stories you hear about him after he was traded to Dallas; while still being the number 1 option on offense and leading the Pistons in scoring each seasons in Detroit.</p>

<p>The Pistons had not won a playoff series since the 1975-1976 season, and had never gone to a Conference Final or NBA Final since the franchise became the Detroit Pistons in 1957 until Adrian Dantley was traded to the Pistons and the team drafted Dennis Rodman and John Salley the same year in 1986.</p>

<p>1st year with Dantley game 7 Eastern Conference Finals.</p>

<p>2nd year with Dantley game 7 NBA Finals.</p>

<p>3rd year with Dantley he was traded during the season and the Pistons won the NBA Championship after he left.</p>

      <label for="los9f0x" class="commentText"><p>I see pascal siakam as one of the best scorers in the league. That might seem insane, but watching him play it’s impossible to ignore his ability to make shots out of nothing. With the pacers they often just give him the ball, no screen, no play, just hey man, figure it out. Basically every shot he takes he generates himself, and even then has consistently shot around 50% for the majority of his career. Not to mention he was a top 3 player on a championship team, and the after the team broke up he developed into a legitimate 2nd option. There’s so many great teams that if you put him on their roster he would be the 2nd best creator. Basically any decent team becomes a contender once you add pascal siakam. The only exceptions I can think of are Dallas because of kyrie and the Celtics. He would be the best player on any tanking team in the east. I would say a good comparison would be Demar Derozan with more speed, marginally better passing, significantly better defense and generally more athelecism</p>

<p>Gobert would have been the best defensive player in the league by far if he played in the 2000s and 90s.</p>

<p>In terms of size, Gobert actually weighs more than David Robinson did. Mans actually built super well.</p>

<p>People dont seem to realise just how big some bigs are in todays league. Except for Shaq, youd have a hard time findings bigs that actually weigh as much as Jokic or Embid.</p>

<p>Hell AD and Bam are actually dam big themselves.</p>

<p>People should really look up just how big some of the bigs nowadays actually are.</p>

<p>Its not as easy to actually score on Gibert as highlights would have you believe. Its just the guys scoring on him are some of the best scorers ever.</p>

<p>What are these &ldquo;elite bigs&rdquo; you speak off.</p>

<p>Like bruh there aint even that many.</p>

<p>And as said before, none are actually any bigger than the bigs nowadays.</p>

<p>Hell Hakeem is smaller than Gobert by a good amount. He has the footwork to get him posted up, but you are delusional if you think there were even 10 bigs able to just casually destroy Gobert.</p>

<p>Shaq is one thing, but Shaq isnt the whole league and even for him Gobert presents the issue of just being taller than him.</p>

<p>There is this weird delusion that bigs back then were stronger, bigger and better than they are nowadays.</p>

<p>shoot Stanley freaking Johnson led the Lakers to a coomeback victory by going at Gobert lol. Haretnstein cooked Gobert with simple hook shots</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All these fantastic defenders get cooked here and there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shaq, KG, Duncan, Dwight, Pau, Amare, Dirk, ZBo, Yao, JO, Sheed, Boozer, etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See now you are taking guys that had their primes at very difrent times and are just underrating Goberts defense. Pau and Dwight werent at their offensive peaks at the same time as Shaq or Duncan.</p>

<p>Yao was so full of injuries that counting him is pointless.</p>

<p>Dwight was also just never that good on offense, so i dunno why youd even think that hed just cook Gobert. And same kinda goes for Duncan. Man shot at the same rate as Kobe. Great defender, solid passer, but wasnt exactly a scoring machine for most of his carrier.</p>

<p>Half these are also 4s and Gobert is a 5. Hed at best be a help defender on a lot of these guys and play alongside another big so that he can help off him.</p>

      <label for="los1abb" class="commentText"><p>Think the discourse has flipped way too hard on Dame. It happens to every single star once they have expectations to win. Darlings like Ant and SGA have 1 year where they disappoint and fail to reach expectations, everyone will flip on them too.</p>

<p>But Dame was seen as the most loyal superstar that was so reliable to drag a team without any noteworthy help around him to the playoffs. Now, folks are saying he stat padded his whole time with the Blazers and now can&rsquo;t help a real team win.</p>

<p>No excuses but everything went wrong for him last season. From the late trade and leaving the city he never wanted to depart from, messy divorce and custody stuff, changing a coach midway in the season, dealing with an injured and old roster. There was never a single issue regarding Dame up until last year besides him wanting more help and if Giannis is healthy, things can be very dangerous with a locked in Dame. I think he will have a huge year but I think folks need to give him his respect as the 3rd best PG over the past 10 years. Wouldn&rsquo;t take anyone outside of Steph and Russ over him and honestly him sending Russ home in a matchup series.</p>

      <label for="lorx892" class="commentText"><p>Luka is a fine defender. Not saying he’s great. But he was fine/improved this year and was always good when trying. Was a stamina, maybe even effort thing bc he was carrying lard before this year. This year his effort was more consistent. He was fine and good in the playoffs until the finals. Now everyone thinks he’s awful at it. Just not true.</p>

<p>His counterpart, Jokic, is the same if not worse although maybe less exposed as a center. Curry is same if not worse. Shai is a bit better but gets a bit too much credit as a defender. Giannis is awesome at D lol. Lebron /Kd are good but can’t give full effort at all times.</p>

      <label for="lorzea8" class="commentText"><p>The thing is on an individual level offense is more important that defense. Look at the top 10 players year after year and see how many of them are above average offensive players and below average defensive players. Now look at the list again and see how many of them are above average defensive players and below average defensive players. You’re not gonna find a lot of those but you will find a lot of the former.</p>

<p>I use to be all about Jimmy Butlers and Klay Thompsons of the world and stress how much their defense matters. And it does. I would be very high on these players and more than the consensus. But defense on an individual level does not make up for 50% of the impact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year. Although this year has been incredibly difficult for me personally, I can only imagine the pain she has had to endure. I also want to apologize to her parents and family members, and to my family and friends and supporters, and to the citizens of Eagle, Colorado.</p>

<p>I also want to make it clear that I do not question the motives of this young woman. No money has been paid to this woman. She has agreed that this statement will not be used against me in the civil case. Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.</p>

<p>I issue this statement today fully aware that while one part of this case ends today, another remains. I understand that the civil case against me will go forward. That part of this case will be decided by and between the parties directly involved in the incident and will no longer be a financial or emotional drain on the citizens of the state of Colorado</p>

He couldn&rsquo;t find a different path to winning after our defensive strategy nullified the Mavs, and I would even say he didn&rsquo;t really try he just kept getting his while the rest of the team was in the mud. If that was from selfishness or he just doesn&rsquo;t know any way, who&rsquo;s to say.</p>

      <label for="losbxwm" class="commentText"><p>Makes sense. Luka is definitely a bit of an offensive prodigy and his assist numbers can be misleading. They’re not CP3 or LeBron assists, they’re Westbrook type assists. I do think he was outmatched vs the Celtics with their talent and experience though, especially with what they could throw at him defensively. And Kyrie disappeared on him in Boston. He is still young, I think his response to the Finals L will tell us alot</p>

      <label for="losfqe1" class="commentText"><p>I agree with your last point especially. His team yo-yos way too much from season to season. It&rsquo;s pretty inexcusable for the Mavs to have not even made the play-in 2023. Luka is the best offensive player in the game right now, but he has to keep the Mavs playing at a high level and consistently go on deep playoff runs if he wants to continue getting the praise he gets.</p>

      <label for="lorualw" class="commentText"><p>Ben Simmons was never even all star level. People wanna look back and say “u can’t change history dude” but Ben was legit always insanely flawed and a one trick pony. His DPOY award was also probably partly narrative based. His defense was centered around perimeter defense which we all know is not as important as rim protection. He had high assists numbers (and really they weren’t even that high, like 7 apg, because he refused to shoot the ball and would purposely look to pass every possesion. Case in point passing up an open dunk to give it to thybulle.)</p>

<p>Tyrese maxey is already better as a teammate for embiid even if he never improves than Ben Simmons ever was for embiid</p>

      <label for="lorut9f" class="commentText"><p>This isn&rsquo;t unpopular at all. Everyone thinks he&rsquo;s a fraud. In the regular season and against ~.500 level playoff teams he was an All-Star caliber player, but against a real postseason defence he was definitely a sub-All Star for the most part. I&rsquo;ll never forget or forgive Sixers fans wasting our time for years pretending that he could ever have been the #2 on a championship team. Fighting them all that time was worse than a tour in Iraq.</p>

<p>On ball defense is great but we’ve kinda learned now it’s not as important as help defense.</p>

The only other person to average 30+ points, 6+ assists, and less than 3 turnovers in a season is 1992 Jordan. Under 2.5 turnovers and SGA&rsquo;s the only one to do it. His &ldquo;stacked&rdquo; Thunder team looked remarkably average whenever he sat or missed games.</p>

<p>And the reason he&rsquo;s so underrated here is because the sub is infested with Luka stans who are butthurt about MVP voting and Celtics fans who are butthurt that he gets more acclaim than Tatum</p>
