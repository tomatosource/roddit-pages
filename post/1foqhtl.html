      <label for="los79g9" class="commentText"><p>Not to hijack but considering how things have played out, KD&rsquo;s rep would be   better if he stayed in GS (if not by much).  That core was running the league and there wasn&rsquo;t really a team on the horizon to challenge them when healthy, which is real reason for all the hate.  Just like the Bulls, Lakers, and Celtics of eras past, fans respect greatness after it stops kicking their team&rsquo;s ass.  If everything else played out the same, the Warriors PR machine does it&rsquo;s thing so public opinion probably shifts more in his favor over time, KD wins in 2022 (and his rep doesn&rsquo;t take the hit from Steph winning another ring without him), and he doesn&rsquo;t have the Brooklyn tenure on his resume.</p>

      <label for="losbihi" class="commentText"><p>The Warriors were already breaking down due to injury, yeah there’s some bad luck in there with Steph and Klay but one more finals run would have burnt them out.</p>

<p>To say there’s no teams to challenge them when healthy is too presumptuous, it’s hard to believe the Warriors would have stayed healthy after so many runs. Elite big man play also started popping up again after 2019, the Lakers, Nuggets and Bucks all match up well vs. Golden State even with KD because of their lack of bigs.</p>

<p>GS won in 2022 with no KD or elite bigs, I don&rsquo;t see how replacing Wiggins with KD lowers the odds of that happening.</p>

      <label for="loru3au" class="commentText"><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo was never the best player in the league and is extremely overrated. The man was an opponent ankle injury away from being James Harden/Joel Embiid 2.0. If not for that, his greatest playoff series win would&rsquo;ve been beating the 2019 Kamikaze Kyrie Celtics. He can certainly be the best player on a championship team, but there was never a time where he was the first guy you pick (all other things being equal) to lead a team to the championship.</p>

<p>That whole series is the clearest example I’ve ever seen of people looking at names on a box score instead of watching actual games. Middleton was great in our three home games and outside of that (plus Kyrie playing half the series, which often seems to be forgotten) there was <em>very</em> little difference in the quality of KD and Giannis’ support casts despite the significantly higher pedigree we had. Jrue couldn’t buy a bucket, Middleton was terrible in the Brooklyn games, Lopez and Portis were getting played off the floor, Tucker couldn’t stop KD if his life depended on it and so on.</p>

      <label for="lorv5dz" class="commentText"><p>Yup, that&rsquo;s my primary reason (which I should&rsquo;ve elaborated more on). His offensive game is too flawed and not versatile enough to lead a consistent, high level offence. Yeah, he can shred through teams not equipped to defend him, but if he can&rsquo;t just bulldoze his way to the rim your offence is fucked. He can&rsquo;t shoot for shit and can&rsquo;t even hit free throws. We&rsquo;ve routinely seen Milwaukee&rsquo;s offence just completely collapse for long stretches in which he was unable to bail them out like an actual offensive superstar could have. I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s no excuse for some of Milwaukee&rsquo;s dire offensive playoff meltdown sequences, but there actually is because Giannis is not equipped to consistently bail the team out of those.</p>

<p>Because of his obsession with Kobe and whatnot, he takes these bad shots when in reality if he just focused on playing more physical.</p>

<p>Its not that he even lacks the skill or anything for that, but that he just refuses to do what he is best at.</p>

<p>The mans better than Shai and more durable than Embid, yet his shot selection sucks so bad that it makes me cringe and thats why he ends up looking worse than he should.</p>

      <label for="los5dpk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I saw a statistic that showed how as Tatum got more muscular, his 3 point shooting efficiency went down with it.</p>

<p>Now i think it might have been because he took more 3s than before, but in general i think the Celtics need him to attack the rim far more than shoot 3s.</p>

<p>Look at the Mavs series and how well that worked for them.</p>

<p>Even though he wasnt making his shots, he got some dam good looks for his other guys.</p>

<p>If the Celtics have 1 flaw as a team, is that they live and die by their 3 point shooting and Tatum being more agreesive could make them not be vulnerable to shot variance.</p>

      <label for="los87tb" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. I know Kobe is his idol but honestly he should be trying to do a version of Miami era LeBron instead (any era of LeBron tbh). His size, body, and current skill set lend itself far more to play like that. He’s a truly great playmaker for a 6’9” guy, he’s almost always stronger than his matchup, he’s got a great handle, can defend 1-5, and is easily the best rebounding SF since Carmelo. He plays like he’s Kobe/carmelo but if he played more like LeBron he’d be unstoppable. Especially since he’s a better shooter than LeBron is fundamentally speaking.</p>

      <label for="los9f0x" class="commentText"><p>I see pascal siakam as one of the best scorers in the league. That might seem insane, but watching him play it’s impossible to ignore his ability to make shots out of nothing. With the pacers they often just give him the ball, no screen, no play, just hey man, figure it out. Basically every shot he takes he generates himself, and even then has consistently shot around 50% for the majority of his career. Not to mention he was a top 3 player on a championship team, and the after the team broke up he developed into a legitimate 2nd option. There’s so many great teams that if you put him on their roster he would be the 2nd best creator. Basically any decent team becomes a contender once you add pascal siakam. The only exceptions I can think of are Dallas because of kyrie and the Celtics. He would be the best player on any tanking team in the east. I would say a good comparison would be Demar Derozan with more speed, marginally better passing, significantly better defense and generally more athelecism</p>

      <label for="los1abb" class="commentText"><p>Think the discourse has flipped way too hard on Dame. It happens to every single star once they have expectations to win. Darlings like Ant and SGA have 1 year where they disappoint and fail to reach expectations, everyone will flip on them too.</p>

<p>But Dame was seen as the most loyal superstar that was so reliable to drag a team without any noteworthy help around him to the playoffs. Now, folks are saying he stat padded his whole time with the Blazers and now can&rsquo;t help a real team win.</p>

<p>No excuses but everything went wrong for him last season. From the late trade and leaving the city he never wanted to depart from, messy divorce and custody stuff, changing a coach midway in the season, dealing with an injured and old roster. There was never a single issue regarding Dame up until last year besides him wanting more help and if Giannis is healthy, things can be very dangerous with a locked in Dame. I think he will have a huge year but I think folks need to give him his respect as the 3rd best PG over the past 10 years. Wouldn&rsquo;t take anyone outside of Steph and Russ over him and honestly him sending Russ home in a matchup series.</p>

      <label for="lorxax6" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem and Duncan(it seems like Duncan is getting more flak for it recently) are overrated offensively. I don’t really think they are overrated as players or how their careers are viewed, but I don’t think people understand that the majority of their value is coming from their defense.</p>

<p>They’ve never been great playmakers, efficient scorers, or even good spacers/shooters. When they won as the offensive centerpieces their relative playoff offenses are in the bottom percentile for championship teams.</p>

<p>I just want to say for Hakeem especially people only look that two years he won but ignore the other years of his career where he was a complete black hole. The two years they won, Hakeem had the advantage of having amazing spacing for his era, which I think really helped his scoring and playmaking look better.</p>

<p>Edit: Also while they lost that series Hakeem averaged 37 PPG/16.8 RPG/2.3 Steals/2.8 blocks in the 1988 first round series</p>

      <label for="los17wp" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem’s best trait offensively is his ability to score in high volume, he’s had many playoff series with big scoring.</p>

<p>The issue is that he often didn’t take great shots so his efficiency wasn’t there a lot of the time, when he makes them it looks great and he’s able to be efficient but most of the time that wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>And pretty much until his two championship years he was consistently averaging more turnovers than assists in the playoffs, as a guy that’s viewed as an offensive centerpiece type player that’s really not too great. His defense is otherworldly though of course.</p>

<p>Who cares he’s a center. Shaq did that multiple times in his career. Duncan did that multiple times in his career. Patrick Ewing did that his entire career. Alonzo Mourning did that his entire career. Moses Malone did that his entire career.</p>

<p>What a disingenuous argument.</p>

      <label for="los1fvr" class="commentText"><p>I think that in general non-playmaking big men have a lot smaller effect than you&rsquo;d expect on team offense because they&rsquo;re often play <em>finishers</em> rather than <em>creators</em></p>

<p>Anthony Davis is similar to this in that he has a great PPG and TS% but his offensive impact metrics always lag behind to the extent that he&rsquo;s easily more valuable on defense</p>

<p>The main exception to this would be someone like Shaq who was so absurdly strong in the post that he could playmake in another way by getting triple teamed constantly</p>

Plus every extra game was a negative for the injured Warriors. Once Bogut was injured in game 5, with Draymond also suspended, the Warriors didn&rsquo;t have much rim protection, and you gotta think that contributed to LeBron and Kyrie putting up &amp;gt; 40 points each in game 5. That gave them confidence to totally turn the tide of the series.</p>

There’s always been a negative narrative around this guy. If it wasn’t “stat-chaser,” or “bad teammate,” it was “not a winning player.” One championship in his prime would have put him as a definitive top 5 PG of all time.</p>

<p>I won’t argue with his inefficieny because yeah it’s always been a problem, but there are a lot of guys out there who are worse in the playoffs than regular season. Embiid, Harden, even Curry for many years. Jason Kidd  for instance shot under 40% for his playoff career and I rarely hear people talk about him like they do Russ.</p>

<p>I felt that Adrian Dantley was an equal to Isiah Thomas and that he was just as great of a player as Thomas was.</p>

<p>He played extremely hard on both sides of the ball each night, hustled every game, was extremely effective, consistent, and of course efficient, shared the ball, had his teammates back against any opponent, provided great leadership no matter what the stories you hear about him after he was traded to Dallas; while still being the number 1 option on offense and leading the Pistons in scoring each seasons in Detroit.</p>

<p>The Pistons had not won a playoff series since the 1975-1976 season, and had never gone to a Conference Final or NBA Final since the franchise became the Detroit Pistons in 1957 until Adrian Dantley was traded to the Pistons and the team drafted Dennis Rodman and John Salley the same year in 1986.</p>

<p>1st year with Dantley game 7 Eastern Conference Finals.</p>

<p>2nd year with Dantley game 7 NBA Finals.</p>

<p>3rd year with Dantley he was traded during the season and the Pistons won the NBA Championship after he left.</p>

      <label for="lorxw7z" class="commentText"><p>No one does no.  You asked for opinions that is different from common perceptions.</p>

<p>Basketball is a team game and people are obsessed with who the #1 option is.  But Denver lost in the playoffs this year despite having the &ldquo;best&rdquo; #1 option in the MVP Jokic mostly because their #2 Murray played not to his best self.  I think in the grand scheme of all time greats, they all have #2 guys who enable them or play well off them and that&rsquo;s how you win titles.  MJ had Pippen.  Lebron had AD/Kyrie.  Malone had Stockton.  Guys who win titles usually have a #2 who&rsquo;s very, very good and it be interesting to discuss who the best #2 option guys are all time because I think it&rsquo;s a nice list.  There&rsquo;s just not a lot of history of 1 superstar teams winning multiple titles - they all get help.</p>

<p>The reality of the list though is that a lot of guys transition based on different points in their career.  Like the Admiral was a #1 option for years, but then deferred a bit to Duncan in the later stages of his career to win a title.</p>

He doesn&rsquo;t belong up there.  He was crazy successful in his role and probably never wanted to be a #2, but that&rsquo;s what he is.  Even in response to my comment people are like &ldquo;Kobe was a 1B, not a 2.&rdquo;  He was a #2.</p>

<p>His volume scoring for his era was basically similar to someone like Luka today who&rsquo;s not as efficient as someone like Jokic but scores on insanely high volume</p>

<p>Like his adjusted era stats for his best 3-5 years today would be low to mid 30s PPG on like 60 or 61% TS</p>

<p>Many people, especially those who don’t watch games often, still stick with the narrative that he’s injury prone. They say he can’t finish a season healthy, chokes under pressure and isn’t someone a team should build around</p>

<p>He’s my favorite player so I’m biased but he played in 70 games this past year, played in all but one game during the latter half of the season, averaged 28.5 post all star break, dropped 40 on the Lakers before tearing his hamstring</p>

<p>I can say the same thing about Ja Morant. Everybody know him due to all the suspensions, off court stuff, but when he’s healthy, he’s legitimately one of the best players out there</p>

<p>You literally contradicted yourself. Season ending injuries are still injuries.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a former Pelicans season ticket holder. I have watched parts of every single game Zion has played and the entire games of probably 75% of them. I&rsquo;ve also traveled to see him in person at away games.</p>

<p>Zion has played 24, 61, 0, 29, and 70 games in his 5 seasons in the NBA. If you add the 1 play-in game he&rsquo;s played, he&rsquo;s played 45.7% (185 of 405) of games the Pelicans have played in the regular season, play-in, and playoffs in the last 5 years.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s never played in the playoffs for the Pelicans. He&rsquo;s made the All-Star game twice. The closest he&rsquo;s come to All-NBA is 19th and 20th. He doesn&rsquo;t have a single MVP or All-Defensive vote to his name. He&rsquo;s the #1 overall pick, generational talent, with a max contract. Yet he can&rsquo;t even make the FIBA or Olympic team.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been overweight, undisciplined, and unprepared his entire career. His circle of trust got him involved with a shady fake agent, made his mom his dietician, let him mess around with a much older drama causing pornstar, and impregnate a dancer. Thankfully, it seems like he&rsquo;s turned a major corner now that he&rsquo;s a father. He looks to be in tremendous shape. His workouts seem to indicate he&rsquo;s improving his range.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t think for a single second that it&rsquo;s a fictional narrative that he&rsquo;s injury prone. He is. He can&rsquo;t finish a season healthy. Worse, is that he&rsquo;s a power forward who doesn&rsquo;t rebound. He doesn&rsquo;t block out. Despite his athleticism, he doesn&rsquo;t block shots. As a defensive box plus/minus of 0.1, he&rsquo;s literally league average at defense yet he has the tools to be elite. And the reason is&hellip; he has never been in shape. He&rsquo;s never been prepared.</p>

<p>I love Zion, but the narrative&hellip; is true. Thankfully, he&rsquo;s only 24. A lot can change.</p>

<p>I love watching the dude play and hope he has a very healthy career going forward, but he’s missed SO many games. You’d think you’d be aware of that if you actually watch the games, because you’d notice he’s been absent more than he’s played since he was drafted</p>

Magic Johnson impacted his legacy in a more positive way than people even realize, on the all-time list Kareem is closer to number five than he is number one</p>

<p>Gobert would have been the best defensive player in the league by far if he played in the 2000s and 90s.</p>

<p>In terms of size, Gobert actually weighs more than David Robinson did. Mans actually built super well.</p>

<p>People dont seem to realise just how big some bigs are in todays league. Except for Shaq, youd have a hard time findings bigs that actually weigh as much as Jokic or Embid.</p>

<p>Hell AD and Bam are actually dam big themselves.</p>

<p>People should really look up just how big some of the bigs nowadays actually are.</p>

<p>Its not as easy to actually score on Gibert as highlights would have you believe. Its just the guys scoring on him are some of the best scorers ever.</p>

<p>I mean yeah he was the alltime leader in 3 pointers but he only led the league in 3 pt fg made in only 1 season.</p>

<p>He never had a game that he carried the whole team on his back like Klay&rsquo;s 32 points in one quarter.</p>

<p>That Pacers lineup was also stacked. Riks Smith was reliable. Mullin despite in his decline was still deadly when open. Mark Jackson was Andre Miller before Miller was in the league. Later they also had Jalen Rose as another heavy hitter</p>

<p>He only had 5 all stars and just 3 all NBA. I know no one could beat MJ in the first team but he still lost to players like Mitch Richmond, Drazen Petrovic. Those 2 guys were great, Drazen would&rsquo;ve been a top 5 European player of all time if that accident never happened. But Richmond isn&rsquo;t even in the top 75 why did they give the guy who was inferior to him in his prime a top 75 ?</p>

<p>If he makes a leap this year it&rsquo;s because he cleaned up some of the sloppier parts of his game: for example, his free throw shooting needs to improve and there&rsquo;s no reason it won&rsquo;t as he has great mechanics.</p>

He&rsquo;s got the best chance of anyone currently in the league or in the draft pipeline to make history with his dad as the first father/son pair in the Hall of Fame, if he&rsquo;s able to keep up the absolute statistical dominance he showed last season.</p>

      <label for="los9pzs" class="commentText"><p>Booker has been getting overrated for years now because of his “pure hooper” reputation. I couldn’t agree more. In 2021 Beal, Lavine, Mitchell and Booker were all the exact same level of player and were virtually tied for 2nd best 2 guard behind harden. While Lavine and Beal fell off, Mitchell and Booker have maybe <em>slightly improved</em>?</p>

<p>In an nba setting he’s a poor defender, a poor playmaker, and a very good scorer. He’s vastly overrated as a shooter (if I’m not mistaken he’s never shot above league average from 3, could be wrong tho. He regularly hovers around 34% which is below average for a volume shooter today). He gets lumped in with elite scorers but he’s never averaged more than 27 in today’s era, which is crazy. Even before he shared the ball with KD. He can’t even sniff top 5 in league scoring.</p>

<p>I don’t even hate the guy, I actually like him, but this idea of him ever being a top 10 player is baffling to me. He’s comfortably a top 15-20 guy, and that’s fine. I think Jaylen brown is without question a better and more viable player than Booker is, he’s just as good of a scorer but in better shooting while also being an all world defender. I think ant is also unquestionably better.</p>

Mitchell also became a more efficient scorer.</p>

<p>Beal and Lavine made 0 improvements since 2021 and injuries made them play worse. Beal and Lavine are not anywhere close to Mitchell and Booker anymore.</p>

Even if i discount total points record bcz of the longevity argument, on ppg basis also Tlthere are literally only 3 guys better than him in the history of the nba! If Wilt, MJ and KD are easily considered as some of the greatest scorers in the game, why this differential treatment for Lebron???</p>

      <label for="losvkxz" class="commentText"><p>Tyrese maxey is basically a smaller version of desmond bane but a worse finisher/shooter and much more reliant on embiid to get his game off than bane is on ja. Bane without ja still was <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> on 59ts without ja in one of the worst spaced teams itl while maxey was <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> on 54ts without embiid.</p>

<p>Maxey couldnt even hold bench units together when embiid resting in the playoffs which is why they lost despite him averaging 30ppg on good efficiency he had a -20 on/off cuz of how bad he plays in non embiid minutes. He’s basically embiid’s jamal murray but better cuz he can actually put up production in the regular season. He’s not in conversations with dame/fox/hali/trae players who have actually led good offenses without a top 3 player itw</p>

<p>What makes him definitively better than someone like Lavine as a player? Lavine put up 25ppg on 62%ts over 3 whole seasons playing next to fucking demar how efficient would he be getting open looks and transition lays off of embiid’s gravity. He can’t playmake fr but niether can maxey. Hes a much better rim pressure guy is a 38%+ shooter on mostly pullup 3s. Even defensively ability wise he’s also better there.</p>

I think he would be better and could help his team more if he let Maxey take more of the offensive load and focus more on being a DPOY guy. I think it would especially benefit him in the postseason where his gas tank becomes a major issue. I think he would be better suited as the offensive number two and a DPOY instead of trying to drop 35 every night and giving some up defensively.</p>

<p>This baffles me even more how ppl say he’s the best player on the team cuz he’s not the best at anything on his own team besides rebounding n screen setting. Genuinely might be skin color</p>

Was a stamina, maybe even effort thing bc he was carrying lard before this year. This year his effort was more consistent. He was fine and good in the playoffs until the finals. Now everyone thinks he’s awful at it. Just not true.</p>

<p>His counterpart, Jokic, is the same if not worse although maybe less exposed as a center. Curry is same if not worse. Shai is a bit better but gets a bit too much credit as a defender. Giannis is awesome at D lol. Lebron /Kd are good but can’t give full effort at all times.</p>

      <label for="lorzea8" class="commentText"><p>The thing is on an individual level offense is more important that defense. Look at the top 10 players year after year and see how many of them are above average offensive players and below average defensive players. Now look at the list again and see how many of them are above average defensive players and below average defensive players. You’re not gonna find a lot of those but you will find a lot of the former.</p>

<p>I use to be all about Jimmy Butlers and Klay Thompsons of the world and stress how much their defense matters. And it does. I would be very high on these players and more than the consensus. But defense on an individual level does not make up for 50% of the impact.</p>
