      <p>I’m not talking about the common ones like “oh Kobe isn’t actually that great” or “Karl Malone is a pedophile”. But who is a player who most people have a certain perspective on but you’ll always view that player differently because of reason X?</p>

<p>This question is for both sides. Where most people view them positively and you view them negatively and vice versa.</p>

      <label for="los79g9" class="commentText"><p>Not to hijack but considering how things have played out, KD&rsquo;s rep would be   better if he stayed in GS (if not by much).  That core was running the league and there wasn&rsquo;t really a team on the horizon to challenge them when healthy, which is real reason for all the hate.  Just like the Bulls, Lakers, and Celtics of eras past, fans respect greatness after it stops kicking their team&rsquo;s ass.  If everything else played out the same, the Warriors PR machine does it&rsquo;s thing so public opinion probably shifts more in his favor over time, KD wins in 2022 (and his rep doesn&rsquo;t take the hit from Steph winning another ring without him), and he doesn&rsquo;t have the Brooklyn tenure on his resume.</p>

Booker was considered to be one when the Suns sucked but he stayed basically the same just with better efficiency when better talent joined. Jordan Poole was supposed to be one on the Wizards but his stats got even worse than his last season in GSW.</p>

<p>Celtics IT had some incredible playoff games like the 53 points vs Washington, even Bradley Beal until last season had similar playoff numbers to regular season ones.</p>

<p>Because of his obsession with Kobe and whatnot, he takes these bad shots when in reality if he just focused on playing more physical.</p>

<p>Its not that he even lacks the skill or anything for that, but that he just refuses to do what he is best at.</p>

<p>The mans better than Shai and more durable than Embid, yet his shot selection sucks so bad that it makes me cringe and thats why he ends up looking worse than he should.</p>

      <label for="los5dpk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I saw a statistic that showed how as Tatum got more muscular, his 3 point shooting efficiency went down with it.</p>

<p>Now i think it might have been because he took more 3s than before, but in general i think the Celtics need him to attack the rim far more than shoot 3s.</p>

<p>Look at the Mavs series and how well that worked for them.</p>

<p>Even though he wasnt making his shots, he got some dam good looks for his other guys.</p>

<p>If the Celtics have 1 flaw as a team, is that they live and die by their 3 point shooting and Tatum being more agreesive could make them not be vulnerable to shot variance.</p>

      <label for="los87tb" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. I know Kobe is his idol but honestly he should be trying to do a version of Miami era LeBron instead (any era of LeBron tbh). His size, body, and current skill set lend itself far more to play like that. He’s a truly great playmaker for a 6’9” guy, he’s almost always stronger than his matchup, he’s got a great handle, can defend 1-5, and is easily the best rebounding SF since Carmelo. He plays like he’s Kobe/carmelo but if he played more like LeBron he’d be unstoppable. Especially since he’s a better shooter than LeBron is fundamentally speaking.</p>

      <label for="louagcf" class="commentText"><p>I actually have the opposite opinion of this.</p>

<p>Tatum isn’t a good finisher. When the NBA made those refereeing rule changes, it wasn’t the foul baiters that took the most damage - it was other players like JT. He depends on other things like mismatches and Gortat screens for his high percentages at the basket.</p>

<p>He takes bad shots because he has to. He can’t get to the rim like Shai or Embiid, he can’t finish like Shai or Embiid, his physicality can only take his scoring so far. It’s just like peak Paul George.</p>

      <label for="los9f0x" class="commentText"><p>I see pascal siakam as one of the best scorers in the league. That might seem insane, but watching him play it’s impossible to ignore his ability to make shots out of nothing. With the pacers they often just give him the ball, no screen, no play, just hey man, figure it out. Basically every shot he takes he generates himself, and even then has consistently shot around 50% for the majority of his career. Not to mention he was a top 3 player on a championship team, and the after the team broke up he developed into a legitimate 2nd option. There’s so many great teams that if you put him on their roster he would be the 2nd best creator. Basically any decent team becomes a contender once you add pascal siakam. The only exceptions I can think of are Dallas because of kyrie and the Celtics. He would be the best player on any tanking team in the east. I would say a good comparison would be Demar Derozan with more speed, marginally better passing, significantly better defense and generally more athelecism</p>

      <label for="los1abb" class="commentText"><p>Think the discourse has flipped way too hard on Dame. It happens to every single star once they have expectations to win. Darlings like Ant and SGA have 1 year where they disappoint and fail to reach expectations, everyone will flip on them too.</p>

<p>But Dame was seen as the most loyal superstar that was so reliable to drag a team without any noteworthy help around him to the playoffs. Now, folks are saying he stat padded his whole time with the Blazers and now can&rsquo;t help a real team win.</p>

<p>No excuses but everything went wrong for him last season. From the late trade and leaving the city he never wanted to depart from, messy divorce and custody stuff, changing a coach midway in the season, dealing with an injured and old roster. There was never a single issue regarding Dame up until last year besides him wanting more help and if Giannis is healthy, things can be very dangerous with a locked in Dame. I think he will have a huge year but I think folks need to give him his respect as the 3rd best PG over the past 10 years. Wouldn&rsquo;t take anyone outside of Steph and Russ over him and honestly him sending Russ home in a matchup series.</p>

      <label for="loru3au" class="commentText"><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo was never the best player in the league and is extremely overrated. The man was an opponent ankle injury away from being James Harden/Joel Embiid 2.0. If not for that, his greatest playoff series win would&rsquo;ve been beating the 2019 Kamikaze Kyrie Celtics. He can certainly be the best player on a championship team, but there was never a time where he was the first guy you pick (all other things being equal) to lead a team to the championship.</p>

<p>That whole series is the clearest example I’ve ever seen of people looking at names on a box score instead of watching actual games. Middleton was great in our three home games and outside of that (plus Kyrie playing half the series, which often seems to be forgotten) there was <em>very</em> little difference in the quality of KD and Giannis’ support casts despite the significantly higher pedigree we had. Jrue couldn’t buy a bucket, Middleton was terrible in the Brooklyn games, Lopez and Portis were getting played off the floor, Tucker couldn’t stop KD if his life depended on it and so on.</p>

His offensive game is too flawed and not versatile enough to lead a consistent, high level offence. Yeah, he can shred through teams not equipped to defend him, but if he can&rsquo;t just bulldoze his way to the rim your offence is fucked. He can&rsquo;t shoot for shit and can&rsquo;t even hit free throws. We&rsquo;ve routinely seen Milwaukee&rsquo;s offence just completely collapse for long stretches in which he was unable to bail them out like an actual offensive superstar could have. I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s no excuse for some of Milwaukee&rsquo;s dire offensive playoff meltdown sequences, but there actually is because Giannis is not equipped to consistently bail the team out of those.</p>

He’s disappointed me in the playoffs consistently besides his championship run. He’s fantastic and a top five player but I can’t put him on the same level as Jokic and Luka.</p>

      <label for="lorxax6" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem and Duncan(it seems like Duncan is getting more flak for it recently) are overrated offensively. I don’t really think they are overrated as players or how their careers are viewed, but I don’t think people understand that the majority of their value is coming from their defense.</p>

<p>They’ve never been great playmakers, efficient scorers, or even good spacers/shooters. When they won as the offensive centerpieces their relative playoff offenses are in the bottom percentile for championship teams.</p>

<p>I just want to say for Hakeem especially people only look that two years he won but ignore the other years of his career where he was a complete black hole. The two years they won, Hakeem had the advantage of having amazing spacing for his era, which I think really helped his scoring and playmaking look better.</p>

<p>Edit: Also while they lost that series Hakeem averaged 37 PPG/16.8 RPG/2.3 Steals/2.8 blocks in the 1988 first round series</p>

      <label for="los17wp" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem’s best trait offensively is his ability to score in high volume, he’s had many playoff series with big scoring.</p>

<p>The issue is that he often didn’t take great shots so his efficiency wasn’t there a lot of the time, when he makes them it looks great and he’s able to be efficient but most of the time that wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>And pretty much until his two championship years he was consistently averaging more turnovers than assists in the playoffs, as a guy that’s viewed as an offensive centerpiece type player that’s really not too great. His defense is otherworldly though of course.</p>

<p>Who cares he’s a center. Shaq did that multiple times in his career. Duncan did that multiple times in his career. Patrick Ewing did that his entire career. Alonzo Mourning did that his entire career. Moses Malone did that his entire career.</p>

<p>Anthony Davis is similar to this in that he has a great PPG and TS% but his offensive impact metrics always lag behind to the extent that he&rsquo;s easily more valuable on defense</p>

<p>The main exception to this would be someone like Shaq who was so absurdly strong in the post that he could playmake in another way by getting triple teamed constantly</p>

Plus every extra game was a negative for the injured Warriors. Once Bogut was injured in game 5, with Draymond also suspended, the Warriors didn&rsquo;t have much rim protection, and you gotta think that contributed to LeBron and Kyrie putting up &amp;gt; 40 points each in game 5. That gave them confidence to totally turn the tide of the series.</p>

<p>I felt that Adrian Dantley was an equal to Isiah Thomas and that he was just as great of a player as Thomas was.</p>

<p>He played extremely hard on both sides of the ball each night, hustled every game, was extremely effective, consistent, and of course efficient, shared the ball, had his teammates back against any opponent, provided great leadership no matter what the stories you hear about him after he was traded to Dallas; while still being the number 1 option on offense and leading the Pistons in scoring each seasons in Detroit.</p>

<p>The Pistons had not won a playoff series since the 1975-1976 season, and had never gone to a Conference Final or NBA Final since the franchise became the Detroit Pistons in 1957 until Adrian Dantley was traded to the Pistons and the team drafted Dennis Rodman and John Salley the same year in 1986.</p>

<p>1st year with Dantley game 7 Eastern Conference Finals.</p>

<p>2nd year with Dantley game 7 NBA Finals.</p>

<p>3rd year with Dantley he was traded during the season and the Pistons won the NBA Championship after he left.</p>

<p>Because watching the documentary it’s definitely true that the pistons struggled in the first half of the 1989 season before trading Adrian Dantley for Mark Aguirre and instantly becoming rly good (25 of 26) and then winning the championship, would they have done it with Dantley still on the team?</p>

<p>I’ve also read elsewhere that he was considered a black hole for his era, the Jazz didn’t want him even though he won the scoring title with him, etc etc</p>

<p>Was he really a black hole or is that revisionist history?</p>

There’s always been a negative narrative around this guy.

<p>I won’t argue with his inefficieny because yeah it’s always been a problem, but there are a lot of guys out there who are worse in the playoffs than regular season. Embiid, Harden, even Curry for many years. Jason Kidd  for instance shot under 40% for his playoff career and I rarely hear people talk about him like they do Russ.</p>

      <label for="lorxw7z" class="commentText"><p>No one does no.  You asked for opinions that is different from common perceptions.</p>

<p>Basketball is a team game and people are obsessed with who the #1 option is.  But Denver lost in the playoffs this year despite having the &ldquo;best&rdquo; #1 option in the MVP Jokic mostly because their #2 Murray played not to his best self.  I think in the grand scheme of all time greats, they all have #2 guys who enable them or play well off them and that&rsquo;s how you win titles.  MJ had Pippen.  Lebron had AD/Kyrie.  Malone had Stockton.  Guys who win titles usually have a #2 who&rsquo;s very, very good and it be interesting to discuss who the best #2 option guys are all time because I think it&rsquo;s a nice list.  There&rsquo;s just not a lot of history of 1 superstar teams winning multiple titles - they all get help.</p>

<p>The reality of the list though is that a lot of guys transition based on different points in their career.  Like the Admiral was a #1 option for years, but then deferred a bit to Duncan in the later stages of his career to win a title.</p>

He doesn&rsquo;t belong up there.  He was crazy successful in his role and probably never wanted to be a #2, but that&rsquo;s what he is.  Even in response to my comment people are like &ldquo;Kobe was a 1B, not a 2.&rdquo;  He was a #2.</p>

      <label for="lorwx24" class="commentText"><p>My 2nd take is gonna be controversial as hell, but i need to say it.</p>

<p>Gobert would have been the best defensive player in the league by far if he played in the 2000s and 90s.</p>

<p>In terms of size, Gobert actually weighs more than David Robinson did. Mans actually built super well.</p>

<p>People dont seem to realise just how big some bigs are in todays league. Except for Shaq, youd have a hard time findings bigs that actually weigh as much as Jokic or Embid.</p>

<p>Hell AD and Bam are actually dam big themselves.</p>

<p>People should really look up just how big some of the bigs nowadays actually are.</p>

<p>Its not as easy to actually score on Gibert as highlights would have you believe. Its just the guys scoring on him are some of the best scorers ever.</p>

<p>Many people, especially those who don’t watch games often, still stick with the narrative that he’s injury prone. They say he can’t finish a season healthy, chokes under pressure and isn’t someone a team should build around</p>

<p>He’s my favorite player so I’m biased but he played in 70 games this past year, played in all but one game during the latter half of the season, averaged 28.5 post all star break, dropped 40 on the Lakers before tearing his hamstring</p>

<p>I can say the same thing about Ja Morant. Everybody know him due to all the suspensions, off court stuff, but when he’s healthy, he’s legitimately one of the best players out there</p>

<p>before tearing his hamstring</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You literally contradicted yourself. Season ending injuries are still injuries.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a former Pelicans season ticket holder. I have watched parts of every single game Zion has played and the entire games of probably 75% of them. I&rsquo;ve also traveled to see him in person at away games.</p>

<p>Zion has played 24, 61, 0, 29, and 70 games in his 5 seasons in the NBA. If you add the 1 play-in game he&rsquo;s played, he&rsquo;s played 45.7% (185 of 405) of games the Pelicans have played in the regular season, play-in, and playoffs in the last 5 years.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s never played in the playoffs for the Pelicans. He&rsquo;s made the All-Star game twice. The closest he&rsquo;s come to All-NBA is 19th and 20th. He doesn&rsquo;t have a single MVP or All-Defensive vote to his name. He&rsquo;s the #1 overall pick, generational talent, with a max contract. Yet he can&rsquo;t even make the FIBA or Olympic team.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been overweight, undisciplined, and unprepared his entire career. His circle of trust got him involved with a shady fake agent, made his mom his dietician, let him mess around with a much older drama causing pornstar, and impregnate a dancer. Thankfully, it seems like he&rsquo;s turned a major corner now that he&rsquo;s a father. He looks to be in tremendous shape. His workouts seem to indicate he&rsquo;s improving his range.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t think for a single second that it&rsquo;s a fictional narrative that he&rsquo;s injury prone. He is. He can&rsquo;t finish a season healthy. Worse, is that he&rsquo;s a power forward who doesn&rsquo;t rebound. He doesn&rsquo;t block out. Despite his athleticism, he doesn&rsquo;t block shots. As a defensive box plus/minus of 0.1, he&rsquo;s literally league average at defense yet he has the tools to be elite. And the reason is&hellip; he has never been in shape. He&rsquo;s never been prepared.</p>

<p>I love Zion, but the narrative&hellip; is true. Thankfully, he&rsquo;s only 24. A lot can change.</p>

<p>Julius Randle deserves more credit for what he&rsquo;s done in NY over the last few years.</p>

<p>If the raptors do well this season it&rsquo;s because he had a great year. It&rsquo;s been a long time since the Raptors have had a really reliable scorer like that outside of Kawhi Leonard, the last time was probably Derozan.</p>

<p>If he makes a leap this year it&rsquo;s because he cleaned up some of the sloppier parts of his game: for example, his free throw shooting needs to improve and there&rsquo;s no reason it won&rsquo;t as he has great mechanics.</p>

He&rsquo;s got the best chance of anyone currently in the league or in the draft pipeline to make history with his dad as the first father/son pair in the Hall of Fame, if he&rsquo;s able to keep up the absolute statistical dominance he showed last season.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a pretty substantial chance that he leads the league in both rebounding and assists for at least one season before he retires.</p>

      <label for="lou5ry0" class="commentText"><p>Perception of Prime Melo right now is far worse than he was in reality. His biggest fault is that he was drafted with LeBron, thus he was compared to him in terms of success. Melo immediately made the Nuggets a playoffs team in a bloodbath west which was an achievement of it&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>He really lacked development of passing and defense which is his fault, but the teams that were surrounding him weren&rsquo;t balanced enough. When he actually got a contending PG in Billups, the Nuggets went to the WCF. He was dominating that run, destroyed Dallas and CP3 Hornets, losing only to the Lakers that were on a revenge mission. I believe 09 Nuggest would have won the title, which would be before Lebron&rsquo;s first one.</p>

<p>I mean yeah he was the alltime leader in 3 pointers but he only led the league in 3 pt fg made in only 1 season.</p>

<p>He never had a game that he carried the whole team on his back like Klay&rsquo;s 32 points in one quarter.</p>

<p>That Pacers lineup was also stacked. Riks Smith was reliable. Mullin despite in his decline was still deadly when open. Mark Jackson was Andre Miller before Miller was in the league. Later they also had Jalen Rose as another heavy hitter</p>

<p>He only had 5 all stars and just 3 all NBA. I know no one could beat MJ in the first team but he still lost to players like Mitch Richmond, Drazen Petrovic. Those 2 guys were great, Drazen would&rsquo;ve been a top 5 European player of all time if that accident never happened. But Richmond isn&rsquo;t even in the top 75 why did they give the guy who was inferior to him in his prime a top 75 ?</p>

<p>Just replace Reggie with Dwight and we&rsquo;re good to go.</p>

I think he would be better and could help his team more if he let Maxey take more of the offensive load and focus more on being a DPOY guy. I think it would especially benefit him in the postseason where his gas tank becomes a major issue. I think he would be better suited as the offensive number two and a DPOY instead of trying to drop 35 every night and giving some up defensively.</p>
