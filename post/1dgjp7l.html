</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>10 years ago, the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Miami Heat in 5 games of the 2014 NBA Finals to claim their 5th NBA title.</p>

<p>That victory completed an exemplary redemption season following a heartbreaking defeat against the same Miami Heat in the 2013 Finals the year prior. The Spurs became the first team since 1989 to win a title the season after losing the NBA Finals in seven games.</p>

<p>This San Antonio Spurs team is widely regarded as having played the best team basketball ever seen, since dubbed &ldquo;the beautiful game&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Led by the Big Three of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, along with an emerging Kawhi Leonard (who would go on to be Finals MVP) and an incredibly diverse and international supporting cast of guys like Patty Mills, Dany Green, Boris Diaw, Marco Belinelli and Tiago Splitter, the Spurs showcased a ball-sharing style of basketball which has not been replicated since.</p>

<p>In the regular season, they finished with a 62-20 record and won 22 of their 26 last games. They went undefeated in March (16-0) and recorded a 19-0 winning streak between February and April. They led the league in APG and 3P%. Gregg Popovich was named Coach of the Year, Tony Parker made All-NBA 2nd team and Kawhi Leonard made All-Defense 2nd team.</p>

<p>After defeating the Mavericks in 7 games, the Blazers in 5 games and the Thunder in 6 games, the San Antonio Spurs reached the Finals for the sixth time in franchise history. This marked the first time that the Spurs made back-to-back Finals appearances.</p>

<p>After winning game 1 and losing game 2, the Spurs would go on to win the title after winning games 3, 4 and 5 by an average point differential of 19. In those three games, they recorded 157 more passes per game than the Heat. Boris Diaw, someone who most teams would have discarded without giving it a second thought, orchestrated the Spurs offense and put on an absolute clinic on how to share the ball.</p>

<p>In those 5 games, the Spurs absolutely obliterated a Heat team which included runner-up MVP LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They outscored the Heat by the largest per game average point differential in Finals history (14.0) and shot 52.8% from the field, a record in Finals history. Over 5 games, they outscored the Heat by a total of 70 points and averaged 118.5 points per 100 possessions.</p>

<p>For most people who&rsquo;ve watched the 2013-2014 season, the San Antonio Spurs played the best basketball in history. A true blueprint of an entire team of players being unselfish, acting flawlessly in sync and being willing to share the ball until unlocking the best possible shot on the court.</p>

<p>And for those of you that have never seen the 2014 Finals or are not convinced, I leave you with this:</p>

<p>He was immediately transfixed, and was legitimately laughing at how badly they were killing Miami.</p>

<p>I showed that team to my mom as well, and got the same reactions.</p>

<p>That team was honestly transcendent. Such perfect basketball.</p>

<p>With the extra merit of not having a genius like Messi, and in a sport and a country where playing as a team to that extent, leaving egos aside and always prioritizing the teammate, is something absolutely countercultural.</p>

<p>I wish basketball would always try to play like that. It would be the most beautiful sport in the world.</p>

<p>The down votes are already on there way but consider this:</p>

<p>Who&rsquo;s better:</p>

<p>Wade or Parker?</p>

<p>Bosh or Ginobli?</p>

<p>Well in 2013 Ray Allen bailed out the Heat or else Duncan would have 6 and Lebron would have 3.</p>

<p>By the playoffs Kawhi was more or less already Kawhi in 2014 though.  Both teams were stacked and the Spurs dominated</p>

Thete isn&rsquo;t a player that embodies the power of unselfish team basketball better than Duncan. That was him not the Spurs. Pop hasn&rsquo;t even recreated that a little after Duncan retired.</p>

<p>My point is that it&rsquo;s more valuable than what Lebron offered.  The same was true with the Warriors.</p>

      <label for="l8ql4kx" class="commentText"><p>You are confused. The Spurs team worked because of each player’s skills were complementary. The “beautiful game” only happened that year. Because roster construction matters.</p>

<p>The heat had LeBron and Wade with overlapping skills and that limits how much synergies you can create. Simply because rosters only need so much on ball players when other skills are not there in the roster.</p>

<p>Besides that, no advanced metric finds Duncan contributing more to winning than LeBron.</p>

      <label for="l8qnykb" class="commentText"><p>There is no doubt. He was amaz8ng in the 4th. He had to be after going 0 for 3 in the 3rdhe also didn&rsquo;t play well in OT because he was understandably exhausted. As you said. It&rsquo;s a team game and Lebrons team which had like 9 players who were either aging Allstars or 1st overall picks had to carry the team at the end.</p>

<p>Then Lebron was amazing on game 7. Keep in mind, he was being guarded by and was guarding a rookie in that series. In game 6 Kawhi had a +/- of 11 and Lebron had a +/- of -1.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying that Kawhi was better than LeBron, I&rsquo;m saying Lebron (despite playing well) had to be bailed out.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just an objective truth. You are ignoring that Lebron also needed a couple FT misses and a bad final shot from Parker to win as well. Again, its not that Lebron isn&rsquo;t a great player. It&rsquo;s that sometimes that&rsquo;s not enough and Duncan had a greater impact on the games he played.</p>

<p>You can make the same arguments in favor of Duncan. He was a big man, he wasn&rsquo;t going to be taking free throws or handling the ball at the end of the game as much but he played his role perfectly every season.</p>
