      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dgjp7l/10_years_ago_today_the_san_antonio_spurs_won/"><p>10 years ago today, the San Antonio Spurs won their 5th NBA title by defeating the Miami Heat in the 2014 Finals after playing the best team basketball in history</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>10 years ago, the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Miami Heat in 5 games of the 2014 NBA Finals to claim their 5th NBA title.</p>

<p>That victory completed an exemplary redemption season following a heartbreaking defeat against the same Miami Heat in the 2013 Finals the year prior. The Spurs became the first team since 1989 to win a title the season after losing the NBA Finals in seven games.</p>

<p>This San Antonio Spurs team is widely regarded as having played the best team basketball ever seen, since dubbed &ldquo;the beautiful game&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Led by the Big Three of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, along with an emerging Kawhi Leonard (who would go on to be Finals MVP) and an incredibly diverse and international supporting cast of guys like Patty Mills, Dany Green, Boris Diaw, Marco Belinelli and Tiago Splitter, the Spurs showcased a ball-sharing style of basketball which has not been replicated since.</p>

<p>In the regular season, they finished with a 62-20 record and won 22 of their 26 last games. They went undefeated in March (16-0) and recorded a 19-0 winning streak between February and April. They led the league in APG and 3P%. Gregg Popovich was named Coach of the Year, Tony Parker made All-NBA 2nd team and Kawhi Leonard made All-Defense 2nd team.</p>

<p>After defeating the Mavericks in 7 games, the Blazers in 5 games and the Thunder in 6 games, the San Antonio Spurs reached the Finals for the sixth time in franchise history. This marked the first time that the Spurs made back-to-back Finals appearances.</p>

<p>After winning game 1 and losing game 2, the Spurs would go on to win the title after winning games 3, 4 and 5 by an average point differential of 19. In those three games, they recorded 157 more passes per game than the Heat. Boris Diaw, someone who most teams would have discarded without giving it a second thought, orchestrated the Spurs offense and put on an absolute clinic on how to share the ball.</p>

<p>In those 5 games, the Spurs absolutely obliterated a Heat team which included runner-up MVP LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They outscored the Heat by the largest per game average point differential in Finals history (14.0) and shot 52.8% from the field, a record in Finals history. Over 5 games, they outscored the Heat by a total of 70 points and averaged 118.5 points per 100 possessions.</p>

<p>For most people who&rsquo;ve watched the 2013-2014 season, the San Antonio Spurs played the best basketball in history. A true blueprint of an entire team of players being unselfish, acting flawlessly in sync and being willing to share the ball until unlocking the best possible shot on the court.</p>

<p>And for those of you that have never seen the 2014 Finals or are not convinced, I leave you with this:</p>

They revolutionized the 3 point shooting but didn’t overdo it like teams today. Their defense was fluid and, though not the best, was good enough to make every team struggle a bit. It was perfectly balanced and we’ve yet to see something like  it again.</p>

      <label for="l8u2usi" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely to the same extent as the Warriors and The Heat especially were heavily analytics driven during the Big 3 years, it&rsquo;s how modern small ball was born, analytics is not &ldquo;take heaps of threes and layups&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s find the best shots possible as defined by our analytics department, instead of relying on post up contested long twos. Analytics driven basketball is about efficient basketball and intelligent passing offensive schemes + heavy screen actions. The 2016 Spurs team took less threes than the 12-15 Spurs. That&rsquo;s because analytics of their roster told them that they needed a heavy isolation offense.</p>

<p>Analytics did not drive up the 3PA attempts of the league. Coaches who were hyperfixated on spacing did that, these coaches were Don Nelson, MDA and Mchale. Kerr followed the Spurs of 2014 for the 2015 Warriors, he just had the two best 3P shooters ever. But even then, it was the Rockets who led the way here.</p>

<p>The Spurs analytics driven team started in 2011 and continued from there. It was something Pop openly talked about incorporating into their offense. The analytics era of the NBA started in 2011, the 3pt era of the NBA started in 2015. Don&rsquo;t confuse the two, even if they are related. This Spurs team just looks like every contender team that has played for the past 10 years outside of the 2020 Lakers.</p>

<p>Nobody on this sub remembers this because 95% are too young, but that WCF against OKC was one of the most hyped series that year.That 19 game winning streak? It was the Thunder who ended it. In fact OKC swept the season series against SAS. The Spurs lost 20 games that regular season, 4 were against OKC.</p>

<p>In that WCF The Thunder had the Spurs 2-2 and were leading G5 on the road in SA before Ibaka got injured and missed the rest of the playoffs. They lost G5 and SA closed them out in a close G6.</p>

I always liked Dejuan Blair since he was with the Spurs, and he played his ass off in that series. Ultimately I have faith the Spurs would have pulled off the Game 7 win regardless, but it&rsquo;s fun to go like &ldquo;Nobody remembers that the entire &lsquo;14 championship run hinged on the time Dejuan Blair kicked Tiago Spliter in the head!!&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l8qlorr" class="commentText"><p>The beauty and choral harmony achieved by that Spurs team was the basketball equivalent of Guardiola&rsquo;s best Barcelona.</p>

<p>With the extra merit of not having a genius like Messi, and in a sport and a country where playing as a team to that extent, leaving egos aside and always prioritizing the teammate, is something absolutely countercultural.</p>

<p>I wish basketball would always try to play like that. It would be the most beautiful sport in the world.</p>

As soon as it it ended at the bar I was at, we immediately walked a few blocks to everyone parading downtown at 11pm. It was beautiful and so unifying. The heartbreak from 2013 was quickly washed away and everyone just hugged and cried and cheered ‘go spurs go’. I wasn’t around active enough into sports in 99 but of the 4 titles I was witness of after, ‘14 was hands down the most satisfying.</p>

      <label for="l8shz5j" class="commentText"><p>Nobody remembers this, but that year SAS got swept in the regular season by OKC, and in that WCF The Thunder had the Spurs 2-2 and were leading G5 on the road in SA before Ibaka got injured and missed the rest of the playoffs. They lost G5 and SA closed them out in a close G6.</p>

<p>2 years later in 2016, the 67-win Spurs would again be up 2-0 on the Thunder, before a fully healthy OKC came back and won 4 straight to send SAS home and advance to the WCF. Nobody remembers this either, because that OKC team is of course famous for blowing that 3-1 lead to GSW.</p>

<p>What could have been for the Durant/Westbrook era Thunder if they had gotten past SAS in 2014 and gotten their rematch against the Heatles&hellip;</p>

<p>That “beautiful game”, focus from the previous loss, collection of HoF vets, the up-and-coming Kawhi, the stability of Pop and his system… like a lot of championship teams, they created their own path and it’s not so easy to duplicate any of it. They were a super balanced team with everybody in the roster averaging less than 30 mpg.</p>

<p>You might argue that the more recent formulae, whether that’s Lebron + AD, Denver+ Nuggets, or Bucks + Giannis is lot easier to duplicate than what the Spurs had.</p>

He won many league titles after that but the quality of the team was never the same again after Xavi and Iniesta left.</p>

<p>I just noticed both Barcelona and Spurs had one thing in common, their philosophy of one extra pass. Just one extra pass could make things happen. Both were one of the most effective and beautiful teams to watch.</p>

But team basketball with tons of ball movement is my absolute favourite type of basketball. Team chemistry excites me more than dunks and all that. The Spurs were the absolute exemplary of the best kind of basketball that season and from then on i knew i had to rep them.</p>

      <label for="l8ug0z5" class="commentText"><p>Man, ten years? Fuck that&rsquo;s sad. I still remember going to my local street basketball court to practice alone after watching those Finals games. Loving the game. Also watching some Kuroko no Basket in the afternoon. It was some of the best days of my life. Pure nostalgia.</p>

<p>I think one aspect that doesn&rsquo;t get emphasized enough is that most of the team was composed of european or european formed players. Manu played in Italy, won Euroleague IIIRC. Splitter, heavily underrated, was Finals MVP in the Spanish league with a small team, unlike Luka who played for the juggernauts. Boris Diaw. Belinelli. Funnily enough Tony Parker is the worst passer from that group.</p>

<p>And finally, rounding up the team they had some randoms like Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard. But let&rsquo;s not forget one was way out of his prime and the other was before his prime. But it didn&rsquo;t matter BECAUSE the rest of the cast was so good sharing the ball.</p>

<p>The thing that surprises me is that no GM after that tried to form a team composed of international or FIBA formed players + a few great americans like this team. Even San Antonio stopped doing it.</p>

<p>Now europeans are dominating the league like Doncic or Jokic but they are mega stars, that Spurs team didn&rsquo;t even had that, it was just a team of great passers and extremely high IQ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Analytics&rdquo; basketball for some reason doesn&rsquo;t take into account how well a player moves the ball and passes it. The Celtics that are about to win a chip are specially great in that regard BTW, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons they felt so superior to the Mavs in the first 3 games.</p>

<p>I have to add that, in my opinion, that the true MVPs from that team were Boris and Manu. Boris fucking Diaw could have been the MVP.</p>

<p>Well in 2013 Ray Allen bailed out the Heat or else Duncan would have 6 and Lebron would have 3.</p>

<p>By the playoffs Kawhi was more or less already Kawhi in 2014 though.  Both teams were stacked and the Spurs dominated</p>

<p>The heat had LeBron and Wade with overlapping skills and that limits how much synergies you can create. Simply because rosters only need so much on ball players when other skills are not there in the roster.</p>

<p>Besides that, no advanced metric finds Duncan contributing more to winning than LeBron.</p>

<p>Yeah and then they had Battier (great 3 and D role player), Allen, Chris Bosh, Anderson, Chalmers, Lewis. They had all the roles covered. It&rsquo;s not like they were want for scoring. They were top 5 in scoring and top 5 in D.</p>

<p>The Lebron Heat&rsquo;s weakness are nothing like you are saying. They were bad at rebounding and turned the ball over a lot. It doesnt hurt to have 2 ball handlers. what a weird take</p>

      <label for="l8r3qv9" class="commentText"><p>dont get me wrong on one level, I understand your point and I think Lebron became a much better player because he had to develop his shooting and passing skills to compliment. I think that&rsquo;s why the Mavs breezed by them in the finals in 2011.</p>

<p>With that said, it does hurt to have two great players. You were originally saying that the Spurs complimented each other better. Overall I think that&rsquo;s true but my point is that it started and ended with Duncan. The game was all about half court sets and Duncan was by far the best of his generation in defending that as a Power Forward.</p>

<p>It seems like you kind of agree with me. Lebron&rsquo;s offensive output at the time was not as impactful as Duncan&rsquo;s defensive presence and offensive consistency. That was my original point.</p>

<p>Kawhi has a better net rating in the playoffs. Actually 8 players in the Spurs had a better net rating than Duncan. All above 10. A clear evidence of a complete team but not an evidence of Duncan being better at elevating his teammates.</p>

<p>Are you assuming they didn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>There is no question that in 2014 Lebron was at the ¹top of his game,  the problem was that Kawhi was ready for him and the Heats TEAM wasn&rsquo;t as good.</p>

<p>They were both on stacked teams like I said. The difference is that the Spurs were in the west which was good and the Heat was in the East and in 2013 and 2014 they had two of the all time easiest routes to the finals statistically. In 2014 they were tasked with getting past a juggernauts like the Kemba Walker, Josh McRoberts lead Bobcats in the first round.</p>

      <label for="l8qnykb" class="commentText"><p>There is no doubt. He was amaz8ng in the 4th. He had to be after going 0 for 3 in the 3rdhe also didn&rsquo;t play well in OT because he was understandably exhausted. As you said. It&rsquo;s a team game and Lebrons team which had like 9 players who were either aging Allstars or 1st overall picks had to carry the team at the end.</p>

<p>Then Lebron was amazing on game 7. Keep in mind, he was being guarded by and was guarding a rookie in that series. In game 6 Kawhi had a +/- of 11 and Lebron had a +/- of -1.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying that Kawhi was better than LeBron, I&rsquo;m saying Lebron (despite playing well) had to be bailed out.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just an objective truth. You are ignoring that Lebron also needed a couple FT misses and a bad final shot from Parker to win as well. Again, its not that Lebron isn&rsquo;t a great player. It&rsquo;s that sometimes that&rsquo;s not enough and Duncan had a greater impact on the games he played.</p>

<p>You can make the same arguments in favor of Duncan. He was a big man, he wasn&rsquo;t going to be taking free throws or handling the ball at the end of the game as much but he played his role perfectly every season.</p>

<p>He joined a good team and became better than a HoFer within one year in the league. He also won 2 titles without Robinson or Kawhi. He also beat the Shaq/ Kobe Lakers twice in their prime.</p>

<p>You are avoiding my point. The big 3 couldn&rsquo;t get it done in Miami. Then they added Battier. Then they added  Allen and Lewis. They were one of the most stacked teams off all time talent wise.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying Lebron was bad. It&rsquo;s just that Duncan to this point was more dominate and won more titles. Like I said, I always hated the Spurs at that time but for some reason nobody wants to give Duncan any credit for winning 5 titles and everybody wants to give Lebron more credit for winning 4 titles.</p>

      <label for="l8r6nmk" class="commentText"><p>Duncan, individually was not more dominant than LeBron.
You can make the argument the spurs were as a team. Duncan needed manu &amp; Tony offensively, which at the time people were saying manu was the best 2 guard in the league over Kobe and his style of play was something the NBA was not ready for at the time. And kawhi in those latter years defensively, cause Timmy was slowing down.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say the Big 3 was one of the most stacked teams of all time after their top 3 players. They had decent complementary role players, for their squad but they also had alot of mismatches.</p>

<p>The spurs is a team dynasty, not a Duncan dynasty. Pop created some of the most intricate, and complex schemes that highlighted all his teams talent. The core of the team stayed together for so long they were able to grow players to complement that system, culminating in that crazy play off run in 2014. You’re being disingenuous with your takes and I think you know that.</p>

      <label for="l8rn0mf" class="commentText"><p>First off,  you are talking about Lebron in his prime vs Duncan towards the end of his career. Mt point was that Lebron needed teammates too. Better teammates in fact. It wasn&rsquo;t even enough to have Wade and Bosh the first year in Miami. They got gentlemens swept by the Mavricks and had to bring in Battier. Then Ray Allen and 2 time All star Rashard Lewis.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not.  Maybe my first comment was a little confusing because I didn&rsquo;t make my point about the teammates explicit enough but I&rsquo;m comparing their whole careers. Duncan was beating the Kobe/ Shaq Lakers, the Nash Suns, the Nowiski Mavs, etc and won 5 titles. Lebron breezed to the finals for 10 years straight on by far the best teams in the East when the East was absolute trash.</p>

<p>Part of the game is the mental game, consistency, leadership, etc and Duncan was clearly better than LeBron in those things&hellip;.at least during the years they overlapped. Even in 2019, Lebron acted like an absolute baby when he stopped trying and sold out his young teammates to force the Davis trade.</p>

<p>People are saying I&rsquo;m being revisionist and disingenuous but the pre-built narrative around Lebrons career is revisionist. Lebron has more or less been able to hand pick his teams for 15 years and has less titles than Kobe or Duncan and is tied with Steph. He is the best SF of all time but not the best of all time.</p>

<p>My only point is that he is not definitely better then Duncan and their careers overlapped. People can&rsquo;t handle this because they don&rsquo;t know how to not bandwagon dickride. Lebron is a brand and has been since before he was a pro. You have bought the brand.</p>

They were good players but by time lebron joined them they were pretty equal to the spurs. Lebrons a better player than duncan ever was i don’t get why redditards dride him so much.</p>

      <label for="l8sirxu" class="commentText"><p>You can the same about the Spurs. Ginobli wasn&rsquo;t a starter and never player starter minutes off the bench in 2013 or 2014. Duncan was at the end of career as well.</p>

<p>With that said, Duncan ended the Shaq/Kobe dynasty with Robinson playing reduced minutes, rookie Ginobli, and second year Parker. That wasn&rsquo;t a great team. The media and Reddit will talk up and down about how dominant Shaq was but when some of the support left,  Duncan stepped up and dominated him. You can tell Shaq still hates Duncan because of it too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I rode Duncan. I really never liked Duncan. It&rsquo;s just that just he came out West to win 5 titles when the west was stacked and Lebron breazed through the Leastern conference 8 years in a row and only won 3 titles in that period.</p>

      <label for="l8qzk5w" class="commentText"><p>Warriors had great ball movement but they never actually ran set plays outside of timeouts, their ball movement was all part of their motion offense and mostly worked because they had some absolutely broken shooting talent (and from a salty perspective tons of illegal screens). Spurs on the other hand ran tons of beautiful set plays and actions without seeming like they had game breaking talent. Their scoring load was a lot more balanced than the Warriors too, which is why people point to them more as an example of perfect team basketball even though the Warriors were undoubtedly much more dominant.</p>

      <label for="l8rokf8" class="commentText"><p>the Warriors also depended heavily on Steph’s off-ball movement. Klay’s lethal catch-and-shoot and Draymond’s playmaking from up top were crucial, but without Steph’s otherworldliness their offense l would’ve been only great rather than transcendent.</p>

      <label for="l8qs27e" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not about the superstar, it&rsquo;s about the team. 2015-2018 Warriors played the same style as the 2014 Spurs. Great ball movement. Always passing. But they did it better. So again, how can the 2014 Spurs be the best form of team basketball when the Warriors dynasty copied what they did and made it better?</p>
