Jokic used it and got cooked until his team switched defensive schemes to rotate behind the ball. Gobert got cooked many a time in Utah dropping back, it’s one of the reasons people don’t give him the DPOY flowers</p>

      <label for="l5o739e" class="commentText"><p>I mean, even if it is the gameplan it&rsquo;s baffling. The oops under basket were also feasting not to mention giving Luka space to shoot is just strange. People are talking about the low production from the Mav&rsquo;s bigger guys this series compared to them carrying hard against OKC and LAC but that&rsquo;s because the Wolves are selling the farm to guard the paint while Luka and Kyrie get 50 burgers.</p>

<p>The games have been close but they haven&rsquo;t felt close. That Kyrie 3 felt like the dagger more than the Luka one if I&rsquo;m being honest. The Mavs comeback was rolling at the half and I wasn&rsquo;t sweating.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where the Wolves go from here but at least Mavs have no homecourt advantage</p>

This one defensive coverage narrative is just a small part of the outcome of the game and my intention isn&rsquo;t to discount the Mavs playing better on both sides of the ball but in terms of this specific narrative these appear to just be basic failures to follow the gameplan by wolves players.</p>

      <label for="l5n3lnt" class="commentText"><p>The thing I think people are missing about this is they wanted to shut off Luka&rsquo;s stepback, which is almost always left. Had Luka been going for a stepback to his left, Gobert <em>would have</em> had it shut off and forced him in. In fact, Gobert thinks he DID force him to drive which is why he bit so hard on Luka&rsquo;s first step. He deterred a stepback to the left, so surely Luka was going to try and touch the paint.</p>

<p> But then Luka pulled out a stepback to the <em>right,</em> which isn&rsquo;t a shot he ever really does, certainly not in this scenario. It&rsquo;s one he&rsquo;s been working on, but that&rsquo;s not his comfort shot. So by the &lsquo;scouting report&rsquo; Gobert would&rsquo;ve had his job done, but Luka&rsquo;s offensive game is still getting better and he just straight up fooled Gobert.</p>

<p>No he didn&rsquo;t. If he wanted to take the step back 3, or any 3, he should&rsquo;ve pressured the ball harder at the expense of letting Luka blow by him. But in this situation, it&rsquo;s ok if Luka blows by him and scores in the paint.</p>

<p>He tried to have it both ways in the sense that he wanted to take the 3 away but also stay in front of Luka on the drive. Look at the left to right crossover by Luka, as soon as Luka fakes the drive, Gobert already has his foot by the ft line. He&rsquo;s too far to contest because he&rsquo;s trying to prevent the drive. Not because he&rsquo;s committing too far to the left</p>

      <label for="l5ndben" class="commentText"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/mjPB7ud" target="_blank">You can see the moment Rudy commits to a contest on a stepback to the left.</a> Look at the angle Rudy&rsquo;s body is at <a href="https://imgur.com/MlwNH5t" target="_blank">even before that</a>, where his body language is literally saying &ldquo;take the ball by me to the right but you aren&rsquo;t getting a shot off to your left&rdquo;. Rudy was in position to pressure a stepback going in that direction, not the opposite.</p>

<p>You are talking about things after Rudy was already beat.</p>

<p>I think the little chess match here is being very underrated by some people lol. It&rsquo;s almost like a goalie in soccer on a penalty kick having to commit to trying to block a shot going left or right.</p>

Luka did have a clear path inside, which is probably what they wanted - my point here is that Luka was able to call game because he now has this stepback to the right and Rudy had no way of covering that</p>

<p>which would&rsquo;ve been accomplished had Luka not pulled out a move he like literally never uses in these situations. Go look up any Luka highlight comp of his clutch stepbacks - 99 times out of 100 they&rsquo;re going to his left.</p>

<p>And body to body pressure is a sure fire way to send Luka to the line for 3 freethrows. We&rsquo;ve seen it with guys like him and harden - you cannot play them that tightly. They are too good at drawing fouls.</p>

<p>Not sure why it&rsquo;s so hard to give Luka credit here.</p>

Not many players would be able to do what he did, with a step back going slightly to the right but mostly just straight backwards, feet set awkwardly facing the rim, then pulls up. Most players prefer to have their feet slightly tilted left of the rim, which is why righty players stepback to the left.</p>

<p>People are clowning on Rudy but tbh to get him on skates enough to get clear air for a shot Luka had to take and make a HARD shot that I doubt he makes 50% of the time. So well done to him for making it in the moment - as they say it&rsquo;s a make or miss league. But I don&rsquo;t think the Wolves would feel bad for bringing the game down to a shot where statistically they should win it more than half the time. </p>

Mainly b/c of what you pointed out. His signature move is to the left, Gobert knew it, Luka surprised him. And that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t iso a guy like Luka in a situation like that. He&rsquo;s going to pull some shit out of a box and make you look foolish.</p>

<p>Rudy getting a lot of hate for something 100% of defenders would have failed at. Honestly, would have been better to foul him and ensure no bucket at that point.</p>

      <label for="l5n4xtq" class="commentText"><p>Yes and a big reason Gobert was on skates because he committed way harder to the left than the right, because of what I said above, and was forced to try and recover an even greater distance - a distance he obviously is not going to be capable of doing. Once he was out there on Luka, he obviously knew a stepback was coming. He just thought it was going to be a stepback to the left.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a compliment to Luka.</p>

      <label for="l5olk1a" class="commentText"><p>You compliment Luka by sticking to the gameplan and forcing him off the line and playing team defense instead of trying to guard him straight up.</p>

<p>In Rudy&rsquo;s defense, the Mavericks expected a switch and screened way up at the logo giving Doncic multiple angles to get past Rudy and still threaten a 3 pointer. I am not informed enough to say whether the onus is still on Rudy to execute or if the wolves needed to be able to communicate and adjust coverage in that moment.</p>

      <label for="l5o11cv" class="commentText"><p>He thought he did concede the drive. Luka just tricked him. By shading so far left, you can see the move Rudy made when he thought Luka was driving in on the right. It&rsquo;s when Rudy takes his step towards the FT line right before getting all tangled up. But Luka having the stepback to the right (that he rarely uses, which is what fools Rudy) allowed him to go for the gamewinner instead.</p>

<p>if you watch how Looney defended Luka in the 2022 playoffs, he shades him on his right side, not the left, and Luka missed every 3 he attempted vs. Looney</p>

      <label for="l5o2hhc" class="commentText"><p>because of the replies to this comment I&rsquo;ve now watched the clip way too many times, but I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that simple. The &ldquo;first step&rdquo; Luka takes to fake the drive happens after Gobert thinks the stepback to the left is coming. Then, he tries to recover to stop the drive and that is when Rudy thinks he&rsquo;s got him off the 3pt line. Luka then steps back to the right which 100000% tricks Gobert because it&rsquo;s not something Luka usually does, and Gobert is a smart enough defender to know Luka&rsquo;s tendencies, and that&rsquo;s what has Rudy stumbling.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;overreaction&rdquo; to the first step only seems that way because Luka pulled out a move he&rsquo;s never pulled out in that situation before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuFxKyhN4HQ" target="_blank">if you pull up any &ldquo;LUKA CLUTCH STEPBACK&rdquo; whatever compilations, almost ALL of them are to his left.</a></p>

      <label for="l5nxe87" class="commentText"><p>Yep . Not suprising . I think you can see McDaniels react a bit off. Rudy got over confident of his defensive ability , he thought he’d be able to guard Luka straight up when he Shoukdvd just played smart , pushed up on him and forced him inside for any 2pt shot that anyone else can contest as long as kyrie isn’t the other guy taking a 3 that’s a good % for the wolves</p>

      <label for="l5pbckd" class="commentText"><p>This is actually great info because originally I was of the mind that “Gobert did what he could” but he actually messed up and you can see where. He shades Luka to force him right, gives up too much space allowing for the crossover to his left, then (instead of shading Luka’s right to force him left into the paint) he overcorrects to to get back on Luka’s left. That overcorrect is where Gobert is officially “on skates” as he panics to try and cut off the drive right but there is just too much space for Luka and he is too far behind to even think about contesting the step back. </p>

      <label for="l5ne3gq" class="commentText"><p>huh? how do they do that? When Lively sets the screen and gets the switch on Gobert, there is a wide open lane to the rim. At the same time, Jones runs to the left side so the weak side defender is Slo-Mo in the corner. Gobert has to stay down otherwise Lively goes on a leisurely stroll to the rim for the easiest dunk of his life. The only other rim protection is Naz Reid, who’s covering PJ in the corner and won’t be able to get there fast enough. Jaden can’t go over the screen, that’s how they gave up the Luka shot in game 1.</p>

<p>Do you want Ant to come to double? Because he’s on Kyrie and the last thing you want is to give him a 1v0</p>

Lively would’ve either had to take on Naz Reid, who was in good position and could at the very least force Lively onto the free throw line, or kick it to PJ in the corner for an open 3. PJ hasn’t been shooting well from 3 this series but he has hit quite a few clutch ones in the playoffs including one in game one. That would’ve still been a much better scenario for the Wolves than leaving Gobert 1 on 1 with Luka.</p>

You take an open three from pj or djj over that anytime. If you get to lively quick enough you can hard foul him and force him to make free throws. Even if he gets an open dunk, you still get the ball back with the game tied (less pressure to make the final shot).</p>

Blitzing is the antithesis of no 3s defense. No 3s defense is switch everything with aggressive ball pressure leveraged towards help which is what the wolves planned to do. The issue is the Mavs screened all the way up at the logo and Rudy panicked and flipped his feet to try to guard Lukas step back instead of sticking to the gameplan and it turned into an iso possession and he got cooked.</p>

      <label for="l5nb66y" class="commentText"><p>If the plan was to switch everything then Walker and maybe KAT should have been on the floor. We all know it is going to be Luka and if not, he is gonna kick to Kyrie with few seconds left. Luke should have been doubled same for Kyrie and if you lose because PJ hits a 3, then be it.</p>

<p>It is easy to hate on Rudy, but they literally let Luka ISO him and no one tried to double, which is mind blowing. Luka hit the same shot against elite defenders. He literally did it in front of Kawhi and PG like nothing, and for some reason, Wolves expected Rudy to guard him.</p>

<p>Not defending him, but he actually played good defense on Luka and stayed in front of him until the 3-4th move when Luka had the step back. Blaming Rudy for the loss and him apologizing for it is really fucking dumb</p>

      <label for="l5netkq" class="commentText"><p>It just makes no sense for rudy to not force Luka off the three there too though, like even if Rudy is switched on, all he has to do is force Luka to drive past him (Luka is clearly hobbled, this might be the correct play even if up by 1 probably) and even if he makes the two the game isnt over. Going into OT at home is still a big advantage. Rudy played it the worst way possible.</p>

      <label for="l5nhjtp" class="commentText"><p>Easier said than done - apparently in the post game presser we found out that’s what he was instructed to do, and tried to do. We all saw how that turned out.</p>

<p>I mean, even as a self anointed couch coach I (and most of this sub) could’ve told you before the play Rudy on Luka is what needs to be avoided at all costs, and a recipe for a clean look.</p>

<p>SVG even said “why is Rudy on the floor if they’re still switching” just a dumbass decision by the wolves coaching staff. I think he pointed that out both pre and post shot, he was shocked when Rudy was still on the floor coming out of the TO IIRC</p>

<p>I really thought they drew a play up to double Luka, 1 on Kyrie, and 2 towards the paint to stop the lob. Let our role players take an open 3 (they are shooting 24%). Let the worst part of our game in the last 2 games beat you. Don&rsquo;t let Luka do it at any cost.</p>

      <label for="l5n3oa9" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think Hardy and Green need to be better. Green has been hitting from 3 and hustling, +15 last night I think. Hardy just needs to do a little shooting and playmaking since he’s in thjs role but I think he shouldn’t have too large of a role. DJJ and PJ just have to hit 3s again, hopefully the variance will be in our favor soon.</p>

      <label for="l5n5f04" class="commentText"><p>Green has been more helpful than his stats but he would be way better if he contributed at all with his own shot creation. He&rsquo;s only shown small flashes of it in the regular season and it makes our offense a lot more dynamic.</p>

<p>Hardy just needs to be consistent off the bench. We don&rsquo;t need him to play a lot, but we need a playmaking guard off the bench to not completely shit the bed. I&rsquo;m surprised he&rsquo;s even getting playoff minutes but Exum has disappeared so Hardy is our best option right now.</p>

      <label for="l5pqvhh" class="commentText"><p>what? No, he is already developed to a decent 3&amp;D player. He will be in NBA with this performance level for a good time.</p>

<p>If he can create off the dribble then he&rsquo;d be a starter and earning much much more money.</p>

<p>Some skills are not developed after some age. He is not a 13 years old kid. I dont think he can develop a game that creates his own offense like a starter. Thats a different skill package.</p>

<p>Be a solid 3&amp;D player, dont get in foul trouble, make rotations right, finish in transition, dont fumble rebounds. These are the things to focus on. I trust his 3pt shot much more than last years so he is improving.</p>

<p>Its an outcome of Wolves defensive scheme. They insist to defend corner 3s and role players.</p>

<p>On other side, Mavs are bringing help defense. Look at KAT&rsquo;s FG%. Its absymal for a reason. KAT-Ant are not as good passer as Luka-Kyrie. So help defense works with a rim protector inside.</p>

<p>Its a Gobert-oriented defense problem. It doesn&rsquo;t work against good perimeter players. There is a way to abuse it and in playoff they are getting abused. Last series, Wolves got some nice refs, and also Murray was injured as the only perimeter player to attack the paint.</p>

<p>Now Mavs have two of Luka, Kyrie and Hardy on the court and they feast against this defense.</p>

<p>A high IQ play would have been McDaniels letting Lively go and double Luka, at best they give up a dunk which ties the game. A coach on defense will tell you that a contested 3 is better than an open dunk.</p>

      <label for="l5naw09" class="commentText"><p>Yeah i noticed that 2. He had both hand on McDaniels and McDaniels was like &ldquo; Oh well i guess I am going with him&rdquo;&hellip; Which was the correct choice, the moment he runs for double team Luka would pass to Lively and that would be easy dunk.</p>

<p>But one would argue that is a better since it still gives you better chance for a win/draw rather than letting one of the most clutch player in current NBA play iso ball vs Gobert&hellip; but honestly i would expect Gobert to be way on the line and not worry about pick n roll or drive for 2.</p>

<p>Still it&rsquo;s all in hidnsight&hellip;</p>

<p>What a series!</p>

<p>2 Games in and overall score is  213 : 217,  I know a lot of people are already drawing conclusion of 4:0 or 4:1 for Dallas, but man it&rsquo;s close af.</p>

Not to a point of bothering Luka, but Ben would body up and eventually contest the shot at least (instead of dancing like a fool). No one expects centers to defend guards or vice-versa, this will always be a mismatch, but some players adapts better than others. And there&rsquo;s a reason why so many fans &ldquo;overrate&rdquo; older players, why Jordan remains indisputable, why the ratings were way higher, etc.. basketball was played at a higher level in the 90s and early 00s, this is a simple fact. Any basketball fan with minimum knowledge about the game will agree</p>

If you watch basketball AD is always in the frame gettung a good contest. Go back n watch him switched onto mother fucking Steph curry n give Steph nothing but a bad shot.</p>

<p>Yes murrsy hit a shot on AD but his hand was literally in his face it was a great well contested shot. Complete opposite of what happened here. Draymond n Bam have similar possession, Wemby even I think .</p>

<p>If you can’t tell the difference between a shot made thriugh a goof contest vs a shot made when you so open you can pick your nose like Luka purely off an iso - not to mention the screening n ither action those other guys defend .</p>

<p>I know this sub loved to jerk off gobert but AD Draymond Bam woukd all get a better contest then him in that position.</p>

<p>I am sorry but if you think this is a &ldquo;great well contested shot&rdquo;, then you need to find a new sport. Hockey, football, soccer, baseball, I don&rsquo;t know, you can pick; but this one isn&rsquo;t for you lol. This is a wide open shot and anyone who watches basketball should be able to identify that.</p>

<p>You don’t assign those guys onto Luka. But they’re good enough that Luka won’t force them to switch onto him. That’s why Gobert is an 82 game player and not a 16 game player.</p>

      <label for="l5ni1yy" class="commentText"><p>As Luka said like 30 seconds after this clip ends, some players are better at guarding him than others, and Gobert is too slow to guard him. Clearly he thought Gobert was an easier matchup than Reid, which is why he hunted him. Once again, why are Gobert stans acting like all mismatches are equal? Do you guys actually not understand how illogical all these excuses are or are you just pretending not to?</p>

      <label for="l5niul1" class="commentText"><p>Luka brought Gobert into the action because: a) his man was Lively, who’s a better screen setter and roll man than Naz’s man (DJJ), and b) getting Gobert out of the paint is valuable in and of itself.</p>

<p>If Naz was the sole big on the floor, he’d have been brought into the action. As someone who has watched Naz for years, I’d 100% rather have Gobert guarding on the perimeter than Naz.</p>

      <label for="l5o47pi" class="commentText"><p>Yep, &ldquo;modern&rdquo; NBA moment. Switch everything, playing zones by instinct because the defense know they can&rsquo;t be physical. And even so, to give credit to a generational talent, if these dudes were playing real basketball it wouldn&rsquo;t matter anyway, Luka would have created separation by using his fat ass and shooting over McDaniels 1v1, slip the screen and shot, bait a foul, etc.. so many tools, dude is a elite playmaker and shot creator, I do think Luka is slightly worse in 1v1 if compared to playmaking, but he is elite either way. The soft rules benefits playmakers way too much, Luka knew 2 plays ahead that Gobert would switch, it&rsquo;s too easy. And being the &ldquo;best whatever&rdquo; in regular season means nothing, the players sleepwalks in the regular season, the playoffs is when the season actually starts</p>
