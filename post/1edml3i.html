<p>Drew Gooden of all people…to end his warmup, shoots a layup, backs up a few feet. Shot, swish. Free throw, swish. 3 pointer swish. Few feet behind the line, swish…logo, swish. Half court line, shoots until he misses…made 3 in a row.</p>

<p>These guys are on another level. He attempted like &amp;lt;.3 threes a game in his 13 year career.</p>

<p>And then like, when they’re working on a move of some sort like a step back jumper or dribbling and taking a step one way or another before a shot, and they’re maybe going half speed, you see the enormous athletic gap.</p>

<p>And it’s similar with pretty much every sport. Like with high level college and pro wide receivers. If you see them practicing running routes and doing their fakes and junk up close it’s shocking how fast they move.</p>

There was a huge crowd gathered around one particular court, so I was curious who was playing. Quickly find out from the chatter it’s a Californian team against a Hawaiian team, both contenders to win the tournament.</p>

<p>Had never heard of Budinger before that but he was, by far, the best volleyball player I had ever seen. And I played with and against guys who went to powerhouse collegiate volleyball programs — Long Beach State, Pepperdine, UCLA, etc. He was insane.</p>

<p>And while we are telling stories, I’ll share mine.</p>

<p>A family member of mine was on the AVP (pro beach volleyball circuit) for many years and it’s truly surreal. If you have any amount of body insecurities, stay the fuck away 🤣🤣
But seeing these people sky way above the net, while jumping out of the sand, across multiple matches, throughout the same day is nuts. Diving and popping right back up. It’s electric in person, and obviously not bad on TV.
Have met Bundinger a handful of times as we know a lot of mutual people and he’s been nothing but super down the earth and friendly. He would come to AVP events as a fan/friend while he was still in the league and anybody who came up to him he was very nice with. My sister said that most every body in the volleyball sphere are all very positive about him too. And let me tell you, that scene is cliquey as fuck!</p>

<p>Kurt Rambis, Richard Jefferson, and Luke Walton were regularly at AVP tournaments too. My dad knows Rambis from playing against him back in the day and he’s not known as the nicest person ever, but always gave us the time of day. I never met Jefferson or Walton, but my sister has a bunch and said they are hilarious and party hard. These tales are from many years ago at this point tho.</p>

      <label for="lf9rbvh" class="commentText"><p>16 years or so ago I was in a duo that was ranked in the 30s in the USA in beach. We got invited to the Olympic trials. I don’t think we scored more then 10 points in the few games we got to play. I’ve seen video of chase play and he’s so much better than anything we played. Couldn’t imagine at 5’11 trying to spike or block him.</p>

      <label for="lfaakan" class="commentText"><p>Beach Volleyball is the hardest sport I&rsquo;ve ever played and the day that I spent playing it was just a buddy and I going to the courts and getting run by high schoolers and a random coach that took us on for a few hours. By the end of the day I&rsquo;m sure our dives looked like two reddish white guys dying in the sand before having to go chase the ball that&rsquo;s now rolled 20 feet past us.</p>

We were a really good team, but we had no chance. G1 he was lined up against our 6&rsquo; setter, didn&rsquo;t even matter how we tweaked the lineups or rotations. Almost more demoralizing was that their other outside was just as good. Obviously not as athletic, but better vb skills.</p>

It&rsquo;s tremendously fun to watch, imo (although indoor volleyball more than beach, because it&rsquo;s faster). I guess it goes to show the power of good marketing that the NBA has had for so long.</p>

      <label for="lf9hpkd" class="commentText"><p>I also think it has to do with barrier of entry from both equipment and skills. People can imagine themselves putting on some cool shoes, picking up a ball, and shooting around at the rec centre by themselves or with a handful of other people.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a lot harder to get a gym, set up a net, and then get enough people for two teams. Plus the necessary skills required to properly play well isn&rsquo;t more difficult than basketball, but it&rsquo;s really different.</p>

All you really need is a ball and a bucket. The world barrier to entry combined with the star power of NBA players makes it extremely popular across the world, much like soccer.</p>

Water Polo is more or less the same game played in a pool, and is much better known in the U.S., and doesn&rsquo;t draw any sort of audience.

      <label for="lfamxpl" class="commentText"><p>Handball is a slower, less violent, less skilled and less-entertaining version of multiple sports that are already popular in the US. It also requires specialized equipment, like a special ball, a gymnasium larger than a basketball gym, with special painted markings and futsal goals that aren&rsquo;t popular or common in the US. And unlike a sport like cricket or soccer there aren&rsquo;t large immigrant communities connected by their love of the sport making it more popular. Handball has no chance in the US.</p>

But gotta start with the NBA.  In his last two seasons he played 66 games each season and shot under 30% from 3 and wasnt a passer or defender. He definitely chose between bball and volleyball year 1 but when he left the NBA his career was pretty much over. He might have gotten one more min deal but actually ended his bball career with a year in Spain. </p>

<p>or put differently, are you really positive that everyone in your life that you respect wouldn&rsquo;t do the same thing?</p>

There&rsquo;s just not as much money in volleyball.  The highest paid player is Wilfredo Leon, who makes just over $1M.  Budinger got the best of both worlds.  He earned a ton in the NBA and returned to his main sport, albeit beach volleyball, and not only makes a living off of it, but is good enough to be an Olympian.</p>
