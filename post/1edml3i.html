<p>Drew Gooden of all people…to end his warmup, shoots a layup, backs up a few feet. Shot, swish. Free throw, swish. 3 pointer swish. Few feet behind the line, swish…logo, swish. Half court line, shoots until he misses…made 3 in a row.</p>

<p>These guys are on another level. He attempted like &amp;lt;.3 threes a game in his 13 year career.</p>

      <label for="lf8uykw" class="commentText"><p>I played club volleyball in high school, we went to Nationals every year. Between games you generally walk around and watch other games. There was a huge crowd gathered around one particular court, so I was curious who was playing. Quickly find out from the chatter it’s a Californian team against a Hawaiian team, both contenders to win the tournament.</p>

<p>Had never heard of Budinger before that but he was, by far, the best volleyball player I had ever seen. And I played with and against guys who went to powerhouse collegiate volleyball programs — Long Beach State, Pepperdine, UCLA, etc. He was insane.</p>

      <label for="lf8wjzc" class="commentText"><p>It’s a different type of athleticism of course, but I cannot overstate how FREAKISHLY athletic these beach volleyball players are.</p>

<p>And while we are telling stories, I’ll share mine.</p>

<p>A family member of mine was on the AVP (pro beach volleyball circuit) for many years and it’s truly surreal. If you have any amount of body insecurities, stay the fuck away 🤣🤣
But seeing these people sky way above the net, while jumping out of the sand, across multiple matches, throughout the same day is nuts. Diving and popping right back up. It’s electric in person, and obviously not bad on TV.
Have met Bundinger a handful of times as we know a lot of mutual people and he’s been nothing but super down the earth and friendly. He would come to AVP events as a fan/friend while he was still in the league and anybody who came up to him he was very nice with. My sister said that most every body in the volleyball sphere are all very positive about him too. And let me tell you, that scene is cliquey as fuck!</p>

<p>Kurt Rambis, Richard Jefferson, and Luke Walton were regularly at AVP tournaments too. My dad knows Rambis from playing against him back in the day and he’s not known as the nicest person ever, but always gave us the time of day. I never met Jefferson or Walton, but my sister has a bunch and said they are hilarious and party hard. These tales are from many years ago at this point tho.</p>

      <label for="lf8wsa0" class="commentText"><p>Oh man, I played against him at club volleyball nationals our 18s year (basically the equivalent of AAU for basketball). We were a really good team, but we had no chance. G1 he was lined up against our 6&rsquo; setter, didn&rsquo;t even matter how we tweaked the lineups or rotations. Almost more demoralizing was that their other outside was just as good. Obviously not as athletic, but better vb skills.</p>

      <label for="lf8i2cg" class="commentText"><p>I think he knew he’d have a chance to do both. But gotta start with the NBA.  In his last two seasons he played 66 games each season and shot under 30% from 3 and wasnt a passer or defender. He definitely chose between bball and volleyball year 1 but when he left the NBA his career was pretty much over. He might have gotten one more min deal but actually ended his bball career with a year in Spain. </p>
