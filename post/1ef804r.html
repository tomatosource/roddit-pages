      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef804r/kevin_durant_responds_to_keyshawn_johnson_who/"><p>Kevin Durant responds to Keyshawn Johnson who claims that Paul Pierce would’ve had the same success on the Warriors that he had</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Here is KD&rsquo;s response:</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1817998281797988789" target="_blank">https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1817998281797988789</a></p>

<p>Overall I agree with KD here, and I think what Keyshawn is saying here is dumb, especially with comparing KD to Paul Pierce, like cmon bro, that&rsquo;s just disrespectful, there&rsquo;s a reason why the 2017 Warriors are considered the greatest team of all time by a lot of people.</p>

<p>Overall, what are your thoughts on KD&rsquo;s response to Keyshawn? Do you agree with him?</p>

<p>Both curry and lebron stans unite to hate on KD, because diminishing KD makes both of their favourite players look better.</p>

<p>I also think after 987,000th take, we have an idea that KD’s warrior move was weak. He can be a generational talent and also make the weakest move of all time. Idk how every time KD does something notable, people feel the need to bring back something to hate him on again.</p>

The ultimate way to humiliate yourself as an athlete must be to crawl to your supposed rival and ask if it’s ok if you tag along for a title or two since you can’t win one yourself. Most people would be too proud to do so, but for Durant, no toll is too high for the “hardest road”.</p>

      <label for="lfjkclu" class="commentText"><p>Yeah add prime Paul Pierce, a HOFer who’s a top 10-15 all time SF, to a 73 win team and they probably win at least 2 chips in the next 3 years. Debatably his better durability could’ve gotten them all 3.</p>

<p>He wasn’t as good as KD but the team results would’ve been about the same.</p>

I guess he&rsquo;s 10-15, but I feel like there&rsquo;s 10+ players that are equally there: Jimmy, Tmac, Middleton, Adam Morrison.</p>

<p>You could have literally replaced KD with a bench player and the Warriors probably win 65+ and a title again.</p>

The matter of the fact is even with KD on those warriors it was a beautiful thing to watch. This guy is literally a walking bucket and watching him now on the same team with LeBron on team USA is prob once in a lifetime occurrence. Doubt either KD or LeBron will play for USA (Olympics) after this due to age.</p>

Yes the warriors still win 2 (if not 3 if we say pierce wouldn’t have gotten injured when KD did) championships with Paul Pierce. The point here being most of us are not impressed with KD’s rings and neither was KD that’s why he left</p>

If KD stays on the Thunders and they have another year of gelling could knock the dubs out of the WCF.</p>

<p>KD could also have signed with other contenders that would have shaken things up.</p>

<p>I still think we would have a good chance with Pierce but the games wouldn’t have been anywhere near as good to watch nor be as potent because Pierce doesn’t fit as well as KD.</p>

<p>The point is that the Warriors were so stacked that you could put a lot of stars in KD’s shoes and they’d still win.</p>

      <label for="lfjb77s" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the question is do you think Pierce,Curry,Klay,Green plus role players would have beaten the 2017 Cavs. I think the answer is yes but I also think the Cavs would have had a much better chance to win if the Warriors didn’t have KD.</p>

<p>I think the biggest drop off would be defensively. KD on the Warriors was pretty close to all defensive level. I don’t think Piece would have been nearly as good on that end. KD being 6’11 allowed them to run small ball lines ups with very little rebounding fall off. That wouldn’t have worked as well with Pierce. With KD it felt like <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> or <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance the Cavs would lose. With Pierce it feels closer to a <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> or <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance the Cavs lose.</p>

<p>The warriors were way more talented than the rockets. They were just playing like shit and choking but they were so talented the margin for error was so high and they still won</p>

<p>The warriors 4 years later with a  much older core and klay post injuries still won another fucking title with Andrew Wiggins in KDs role.</p>

<p>I’m sorry but it’s straight up stupid, delusional and insane that people like you want to pretend the warriors needed Kevin Durant.</p>

<p>They needed a league average small forward to be a legit title contender, they needed Kevin Durant to be basically unbeatable</p>

Obviously KD is the better overall player, but Pierce on that team would have the same open looks KD got and is probably a better on ball defender than KD (while KD is a better help defender).</p>

<p>Either way, they are still probably winning 3-straight if everyone is healthy.</p>

It wasn&rsquo;t as fulfilling for him. I do think the Draymond stuff didn&rsquo;t help, I do think the fact he joined the Warriors of all teams was a factor. But by the end of his Warriors tenure, he was ready to bounce. He wouldn&rsquo;t trade the decision though I&rsquo;m sure because he got rings from it.</p>

Hmm ya dont say? obviously i get hes trying to say that a lesser player wouldve won on that team, but to use paul pierce as an example when a. he wasnt even playing in that era, and b. he is still a pretty highly regarded player, just makes the statement sound dumb to me. I get hating that kd went to the warriors, its perfectly fine to feel that way, but statements like this dont make anymore sense just because you hate a player.</p>

<p>secondly, i hate hypotheticals, its like saying if water didnt have the property of wet, itd be dry. Like thats cool and all, but what does it matter to think about at this point, it didnt happen, and the hypothetical that he reached for here, couldnt have possibly happened.</p>

<p>I say 20, cause its arguable whether they could get the FMVP ober Steph, even if he had mediocre performances in the finals.</p>

<p>KD is better than Pierce, but the only thing different if Warriors had prime Pierce instead of KD is that Steph has 2 extra FMVPs.</p>

Add Paul Pierce to a 73-9 team and they likely win 2 or 3 rings. It’s just a comment on how overly stacked the warriors were. The 2017 and 2018 rings are the weakest rings ever for everyone involved.</p>

What I don’t understand is the discourse for the 2018 season.</p>

<p>The rockets had a better regular season and were on track to beat the GSW before the Paul injury. They almost won game 7 without Paul if not for insane variance on 3pt shooting.</p>

<p>That rockets team was one of the best of all time and should have taken out a super team.</p>

      <label for="lfka11p" class="commentText"><p>if you put Paul Pierce on the Warriors teams, they probably still win two - three championships (although KD had morphed into a defensive monster on that team whereas Paul wouldn&rsquo;t have been a rim protector)</p>

<p>Someone made the good point about if you put KD on the Celtics team Paul was on, they probably win another championship or two (although they had health issues with KG etc which prevented them from repeating)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that people are still mad that KD left OKC in free agency to go to the Bay Area. Like, in what world is that a bad decision?</p>

<li><p>This only makes sense with prime Paul Pierce; and 2015-2019 Pierce is not prime in any sense of the term. So it&rsquo;s already stupid time traveling bull crap that does not matter.</p></li>

<li><p>Even with Prime Pierce, he was not the offensive talent that Durant was and still is. He would make the team OP, but not to the same degree as Durant. OP is a relative term anyway (and if the Cavs were the Cavs, and KD was still in OKC with Russ, etc., prime Pierce+GSW does not equal very OP).</p></li>

<li><p>There are only two dimensions where Paul Pierce maybe can maybe be better than KD and end up with the same level of success: Defense (I rate Pierce a better defender overall, though he would not have the versatility of KD&rsquo;s height) and as a more complementary teammate (KD often played more like an alternative to the rest of the team, not as a fully-integrated teammate in the system; Pierce <em>might</em> have been better in that regard).</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t think anything good we can say for Pierce in this hypothetical as opposed to Durant.</p></li>
