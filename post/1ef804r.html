</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Here is KD&rsquo;s response:</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1817998281797988789" target="_blank">https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1817998281797988789</a></p>

<p>Overall I agree with KD here, and I think what Keyshawn is saying here is dumb, especially with comparing KD to Paul Pierce, like cmon bro, that&rsquo;s just disrespectful, there&rsquo;s a reason why the 2017 Warriors are considered the greatest team of all time by a lot of people.</p>

<p>Overall, what are your thoughts on KD&rsquo;s response to Keyshawn? Do you agree with him?</p>

<p>Both curry and lebron stans unite to hate on KD, because diminishing KD makes both of their favourite players look better.</p>

<p>I also think after 987,000th take, we have an idea that KD’s warrior move was weak. He can be a generational talent and also make the weakest move of all time. Idk how every time KD does something notable, people feel the need to bring back something to hate him on again.</p>

<p>Embiid may have some bonehead quotes but nothing pisses people off like a dude with all the natural ability you can ask for, just checking out of one of the greatest opportunities in the world at 25, and doing as little as possible to keep getting them checks.</p>

<p>You could have literally replaced KD with a bench player and the Warriors probably win 65+ and a title again.</p>

<p>To replace KD with any 10x All Star in their prime, the results aren&rsquo;t going to look a whole lot different than they were with KD.</p>

      <label for="lflkrir" class="commentText"><p>I agree. They do such a good job of not taking themselves seriously and making you feel like you&rsquo;re in that conversation with them.</p>

<p>I have a clip from an episode last year when Jimmy Murdered the Bucks and Wildes puts up a graphic and then when the graphic is over he&rsquo;s in front of the camera:</p>

<p>Wildes: &ldquo;hey, hey coach bud. They&rsquo;re on a 12-0 run. Call a time out!&rdquo; Then he steps away from the camera &ldquo;CALL A TIME OUT. GIANNIS IS TRYING TO CALL A TIME OUT, AND HE DOESNT HAVE THE BALL AND ITS A TURNOVER&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick chimes in: &ldquo;and for God sake&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wildes is on the side throwing up the time out sign. In the background &ldquo;just one of these&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick continues: &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not like the whole team is killing you. It&rsquo;s literally one guy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bru: &ldquo;maybe a double team????&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wildes feigns shock: &ldquo;oh boy there&rsquo;s an idea&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick goes on to continue his point: &ldquo;THEY&rsquo;RE UP 12 with four minutes left. After the huge run, holiday hits a 3 to bring the lead back to 5. That&rsquo;s the time for the time out. And you know what&hellip;if Caleb Martin beats you Caleb Martin beats you&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brou: &ldquo;AND HE MIGHT!&rdquo;</p>

<p>AND I JUST REMEMBER WATCHING THAT THINKING OH MY GOD THIS IS EXACTLY THE CONVERSATION MY FRIENDS AND I WERE HAVING AT THE BAR WATCHING THIS GAME. LIKE NO BS THIS SHOW IS JUST TAKING WHAT I&rsquo;M THINKING AND THROWING IT ON THE SCREEN!</p>

<p>Show is just different.</p>

But it&rsquo;s a good question to ask, who&rsquo;s the worst player that can replace Durant and still win (if rest of the team is still the same that is)?</p>

      <label for="lfodeg2" class="commentText"><p>I’ve always said that several factors lead to that 3-1 collapse that had nothing to do with Cleveland.
If Draymond doesn’t get suspended, if Bogut is not out with injury, if Steph isn’t injured as well? They would have closed it out in 5 games.</p>

<p>The whole “they couldn’t beat Lebron 100% of the time narrative that’s why they got KD” is such nonsense it’s ridiculous how that’s become the prevailing opinion.</p>

<p>Would they have won every year? Nah I think they split actually. But not possible full stop is ridiculous.</p>

<p>All the presence of KD did was make their team unbeatable, but prior to him they were still the best team.</p>

The point here being most of us are not impressed with KD’s rings and neither was KD that’s why he left</p>

<p>In 18 KD did not care anymore about the Warriors system, their offense grinded to a halt and the Rockets switching everything had it a lot easier defending a more iso-heavy offense.</p>

<p>In 2019 when KD went down, the Warriors without KD took care of business at the end of G5 and finished the series in 6 in Houston.</p>

<p>At this point people are just repeating narratives instead of watching the games&hellip;</p>

If KD stays on the Thunders and they have another year of gelling could knock the dubs out of the WCF.</p>

<p>KD could also have signed with other contenders that would have shaken things up.</p>

<p>I still think we would have a good chance with Pierce but the games wouldn’t have been anywhere near as good to watch nor be as potent because Pierce doesn’t fit as well as KD.</p>

<p>The warriors were way more talented than the rockets. They were just playing like shit and choking but they were so talented the margin for error was so high and they still won</p>

<p>The warriors 4 years later with a  much older core and klay post injuries still won another fucking title with Andrew Wiggins in KDs role.</p>

<p>I’m sorry but it’s straight up stupid, delusional and insane that people like you want to pretend the warriors needed Kevin Durant.</p>

<p>They needed a league average small forward to be a legit title contender, they needed Kevin Durant to be basically unbeatable</p>

      <label for="lfmfp5r" class="commentText"><p>I kinda feel like PP would have been a better fit to be honest.</p>

<p>That is not to say that I think PP is better, but as a fan of the style the Warriors were playing <em>before</em> Durant arrived, I was less impressed with their style of play with him.</p>

<p>Yes, they were historically good. But they had a strong passing game where every player (Curry, Dray, Bogut, Klay, Barnes) all became nodes and they&rsquo;d all set screens for one another.</p>

<p>With Durant, it shifted to a more individual style, and every player on the court was so good that they still dominated.</p>

<p>But we saw with PP in Boston that he was willing to do the dirty work. He&rsquo;d bust his ass on on D. He&rsquo;s made the extra pass.</p>

<p>And it is easy to forget that PP was dropping 25-26 ppg over several season in years when the only people outscoring him were Shaq, Kobe, Iverson, and T-Mac and when team were often scoring 90 points or less per game.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Warriors did BETTER in the regular season with Harrison Barnes than they ever did with Durant, it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to suggest that they would have seen as much success with PP as they did with Durant. Hell&hellip; the Warriors core won a title <em>after</em> Durant left with Wiggins in KD&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>And PP/KD comparisons are so far out of line. Obviously I take KD, but when you put their scoring averages in generational contexts, they are a lot closer than they would otherwise appear.</p>

This is who he is, a sensitive insecure little man inside a 7ft body. He can&rsquo;t even handle a reasonable rebuttal. KD is a better player than Pierce ever was but the Warriors would have won three with prime Pierce cause Pierce was much more durable and not a cupcake who would have bailed.</p>

      <label for="lfjb77s" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the question is do you think Pierce,Curry,Klay,Green plus role players would have beaten the 2017 Cavs. I think the answer is yes but I also think the Cavs would have had a much better chance to win if the Warriors didn’t have KD.</p>

<p>I think the biggest drop off would be defensively. KD on the Warriors was pretty close to all defensive level. I don’t think Piece would have been nearly as good on that end. KD being 6’11 allowed them to run small ball lines ups with very little rebounding fall off. That wouldn’t have worked as well with Pierce. With KD it felt like <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> or <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance the Cavs would lose. With Pierce it feels closer to a <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> or <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance the Cavs lose.</p>

<p>Naw, its not a serious question. The &ldquo;question&rdquo; is &ldquo;lol fuck KD, I&rsquo;m not impressed. Love, Keyshawn&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lfjfu3a" class="commentText"><p>You are basically swapping out an all-time great with another great player.  Obviously KD is the better overall player, but Pierce on that team would have the same open looks KD got and is probably a better on ball defender than KD (while KD is a better help defender).</p>

<p>Either way, they are still probably winning 3-straight if everyone is healthy.</p>

It wasn&rsquo;t as fulfilling for him. I do think the Draymond stuff didn&rsquo;t help, I do think the fact he joined the Warriors of all teams was a factor. But by the end of his Warriors tenure, he was ready to bounce. He wouldn&rsquo;t trade the decision though I&rsquo;m sure because he got rings from it.</p>

Hmm ya dont say? obviously i get hes trying to say that a lesser player wouldve won on that team, but to use paul pierce as an example when a. he wasnt even playing in that era, and b. he is still a pretty highly regarded player, just makes the statement sound dumb to me. I get hating that kd went to the warriors, its perfectly fine to feel that way, but statements like this dont make anymore sense just because you hate a player.</p>

<p>secondly, i hate hypotheticals, its like saying if water didnt have the property of wet, itd be dry. Like thats cool and all, but what does it matter to think about at this point, it didnt happen, and the hypothetical that he reached for here, couldnt have possibly happened.</p>

Add Paul Pierce to a 73-9 team and they likely win 2 or 3 rings. It’s just a comment on how overly stacked the warriors were.
