</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Here is KD&rsquo;s response:</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1817998281797988789" target="_blank">https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1817998281797988789</a></p>

<p>Overall I agree with KD here, and I think what Keyshawn is saying here is dumb, especially with comparing KD to Paul Pierce, like cmon bro, that&rsquo;s just disrespectful, there&rsquo;s a reason why the 2017 Warriors are considered the greatest team of all time by a lot of people.</p>

<p>Overall, what are your thoughts on KD&rsquo;s response to Keyshawn? Do you agree with him?</p>

      <label for="lfjahad" class="commentText"><p>Been on KDs nuts? Dude was the most hated player in this sub by far until Embid took his place.</p>

<p>Both curry and lebron stans unite to hate on KD, because diminishing KD makes both of their favourite players look better.</p>

<p>I also think after 987,000th take, we have an idea that KD’s warrior move was weak. He can be a generational talent and also make the weakest move of all time. Idk how every time KD does something notable, people feel the need to bring back something to hate him on again.</p>

<p>one is leaving the stacked team you were one win away from the finals with for the historically great 73-9 regular season record team you just choked a 3-1 lead to in the WCF</p>

<p>the other is leaving a team that was only good because LeBron played for them and couldn&rsquo;t get over the hump against an unprecedented super team built by trading everything for KG, Ray Allen, and Rondo built to beat LeBron</p>

<p>The Thunder were still competitive after KD left. The Cavs were the laughing stock of the league until Bron came back</p>

That only really changed for him over time cuz Bron won everywhere he’s played for. Durant only ever winning when he joined a 73-9 team (who won before he was on the team and after he left) is the issue here for KD.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a diff between &ldquo;I think KD&rsquo;s move was weak&rdquo; and &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a fucking snake who will never be respected ever&rdquo; and the type of shit you read online</p>

<p>The only reason we look down on KD joining the Warriors is because the Warriors were a complete tram that already won, while other greats that are viewed better were still the center pieces of their teams or were there before the team started dominating.</p>

The ultimate way to humiliate yourself as an athlete must be to crawl to your supposed rival and ask if it’s ok if you tag along for a title or two since you can’t win one yourself. Most people would be too proud to do so, but for Durant, no toll is too high for the “hardest road”.</p>

<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be praised for it? He did nothing wrong except join a team in FA that gave him the best chance to win. Thats why great players play right? To Win. Not his fault FA lined up and GS took measures to aquire KD when the oppertunity presented itself.</p>

This guy is literally a walking bucket and watching him now on the same team with LeBron on team USA is prob once in a lifetime occurrence.

Yes the warriors still win 2 (if not 3 if we say pierce wouldn’t have gotten injured when KD did) championships with Paul Pierce. The point here being most of us are not impressed with KD’s rings and neither was KD that’s why he left</p>

If KD stays on the Thunders and they have another year of gelling could knock the dubs out of the WCF.</p>

<p>KD could also have signed with other contenders that would have shaken things up.</p>

<p>I still think we would have a good chance with Pierce but the games wouldn’t have been anywhere near as good to watch nor be as potent because Pierce doesn’t fit as well as KD.</p>

      <label for="lfk0wlz" class="commentText"><p>I agree they would&rsquo;ve still won just because of how good the rest of the roster was, but KD&rsquo;s ability to protect the rim was pretty important for that Warriors team. PP&rsquo;s main skill was scoring in iso which I don&rsquo;t think the Warriors needed that much, and his skillset doesn&rsquo;t offer much without the ball besides just spot up shooting</p>

<p>However, he isn’t anywhere close to Durant. He made them unbeatable, and he was already a lot better than Pierce when he was on OKC.</p>

<p>That whole series was a defensive grind and KD was able to score consistently well against a fantastic defense</p>

<p>Idk if PP would be able to replicate that against</p>

<p>They needed KD in the west for that season, the 2018 Rockets are one of the best teams in the last 10 years.</p>

<p>The 2019 Rockets were nowhere near as dominant as in 2018, so it’s a bit dumb to use that argument against KD.</p>

<p>I think the biggest drop off would be defensively. KD on the Warriors was pretty close to all defensive level. I don’t think Piece would have been nearly as good on that end. KD being 6’11 allowed them to run small ball lines ups with very little rebounding fall off. That wouldn’t have worked as well with Pierce. With KD it felt like <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> or <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance the Cavs would lose. With Pierce it feels closer to a <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> or <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance the Cavs lose.</p>

      <label for="lfjzd28" class="commentText"><p>Swap a 32 yr old Pierce w a 32 yr old Durant. Thats him coming off the Achilles and playing with a one legged KG. Ray shot miserably through the majority of that Finals w a quad contusion</p>

<p>The Lakers biggest mismatch in the league was the ability to play 3 seven footers and control the glass. Durant doesn’t really help that. Styles win series</p>

<p>I hate hypotheticals. Pierce was great, KD is a great. Let that be</p>

<p>The warriors were way more talented than the rockets. They were just playing like shit and choking but they were so talented the margin for error was so high and they still won</p>

<p>The warriors 4 years later with a  much older core and klay post injuries still won another fucking title with Andrew Wiggins in KDs role.</p>

<p>I’m sorry but it’s straight up stupid, delusional and insane that people like you want to pretend the warriors needed Kevin Durant.</p>

<p>They needed a league average small forward to be a legit title contender, they needed Kevin Durant to be basically unbeatable</p>

<li><p>This only makes sense with prime Paul Pierce; and 2015-2019 Pierce is not prime in any sense of the term. So it&rsquo;s already stupid time traveling bull crap that does not matter.</p></li>

<li><p>Even with Prime Pierce, he was not the offensive talent that Durant was and still is. He would make the team OP, but not to the same degree as Durant. OP is a relative term anyway (and if the Cavs were the Cavs, and KD was still in OKC with Russ, etc., prime Pierce+GSW does not equal very OP).</p></li>

<li><p>There are only two dimensions where Paul Pierce maybe can maybe be better than KD and end up with the same level of success: Defense (I rate Pierce a better defender overall, though he would not have the versatility of KD&rsquo;s height) and as a more complementary teammate (KD often played more like an alternative to the rest of the team, not as a fully-integrated teammate in the system; Pierce <em>might</em> have been better in that regard).</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t think anything good we can say for Pierce in this hypothetical as opposed to Durant.</p></li>

It wasn&rsquo;t as fulfilling for him. I do think the Draymond stuff didn&rsquo;t help, I do think the fact he joined the Warriors of all teams was a factor. But by the end of his Warriors tenure, he was ready to bounce. He wouldn&rsquo;t trade the decision though I&rsquo;m sure because he got rings from it.</p>

      <label for="lfjuhhv" class="commentText"><p>I mean he’s right. He’s not saying Paul pierce is as good as KD. You could put a ton of all stars that are not hall of famers and they would have had the same success as KD with the warriors. Warriors didn’t even look like they cared during the regular season then went on to easily win championships.</p>

      <label for="lfjx11g" class="commentText"><p>im gonna be honest, i dont see the point, paul pierce was a great player, you&rsquo;re telling me a great player wouldve won on a great team? Hmm ya dont say? obviously i get hes trying to say that a lesser player wouldve won on that team, but to use paul pierce as an example when a. he wasnt even playing in that era, and b. he is still a pretty highly regarded player, just makes the statement sound dumb to me. I get hating that kd went to the warriors, its perfectly fine to feel that way, but statements like this dont make anymore sense just because you hate a player.</p>

<p>secondly, i hate hypotheticals, its like saying if water didnt have the property of wet, itd be dry. Like thats cool and all, but what does it matter to think about at this point, it didnt happen, and the hypothetical that he reached for here, couldnt have possibly happened.</p>

<p>KD is better than Pierce, but the only thing different if Warriors had prime Pierce instead of KD is that Steph has 2 extra FMVPs.</p>

      <label for="lfk3a3s" class="commentText"><p>I’m usually a KD defender, and Keyshawn is legitimately braindead and it’s torture hearing him talk but he’s not wrong this time. Add Paul Pierce to a 73-9 team and they likely win 2 or 3 rings. It’s just a comment on how overly stacked the warriors were. The 2017 and 2018 rings are the weakest rings ever for everyone involved.</p>
