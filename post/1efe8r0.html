</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Quotes are from an interview on ESPN700 radio, I got these from  <a href="https://x.com/Dunzod/status/1818039225348202958" target="_blank">This Twitter thread</a>. Tony Jones is the Jazz beat writer for The Athletic</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>On when Markkanen will sign his extension:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I would expect him to sign on Aug. 7th, or after Aug 6th. Lauri doesn&rsquo;t want to be traded so&hellip; I expect him to do it after Aug 6th so there&rsquo;s no trade talk this year&rdquo;  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even think him signing on Aug 6th is even an option. We&rsquo;re almost 100% trending towards him signing on Aug 7th.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lauri has really taken to Utah. His family has taken to Utah. Obviously the Jazz can trade him between now and Aug 6th, and Lauri knows that, but Lauri has forged a really close relationship to Will Hardy. And Will has really found a way to unlock his career&rdquo;  &ldquo;And Lauri really recognizes that and appreciates that, and wants to be a part of the rebuild.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Jazz perspective&hellip; Lauri is 27. His game is not predicated on athleticism&hellip; His game should age well. Meaning, the Jazz are fully confident that Lauri will still be this version of Lauri, or very close to it, the next time the Jazz are, in fact, good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The likely scenario is Lauri signs on Aug 7th, the Jazz prioritize the young guys during the season, and they try to enter the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes&rdquo;   &ldquo;The thing that people are not understanding is that the Jazz are going to really prioritize the young guys from Day 1. And if they had their druthers, they would have traded Jordan Clarkson&hellip; they would have traded John Collins.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Even with that, I still think the Jazz are going to de-emphasize the veterans and are going to prioritize the young guys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the front office is going to go into this with the mindset of: we have to do anything we can to get a top 5 pick in this draft&hellip; the Jazz realize how good this draft is. And I think they are going to act accordingly, whether Lauri is on the roster or not&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spence asks Tony what he believes the Jazz rotation will look like next year in order to prioritize the young guys</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well the number one thing is Walker Kessler becomes the starting center and John Collins comes off the bench&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>On the odds of Markkanen being traded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re down to 2 things&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Number one, they re-sign Lauri and they use the bulk of their cap space, they sign their rookies, they sign Eubanks, and their business is pretty much done&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second option is they trade Lauri, they take back Brandin Podziemski from the Warriors and a whole bunch of draft picks, and they become a team where other teams can dump salary for draft compensation&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re trending towards the Jazz NOT trading Lauri. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a package out there that they are overly interested in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spence asks Tony to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 on whether he believes Lauri gets traded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would probably put it at a 2&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>On why Utah hasn&rsquo;t completely blown up the roster yet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spence explains he doesn&rsquo;t understand the direction the Jazz are going &amp; wishes they would have picked a more definitive direction</p>

<p>Tony: &ldquo;They just couldn&rsquo;t trade their veterans. You can&rsquo;t trade people if there is no one who wants to trade for them&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John (Collins) makes a little too much money. And I don&rsquo;t anticipate the Jazz being able to trade him until the last year of his contract. Jordan Clarkson is the one that surprises me because I thought he&rsquo;d have more of a market this summer, but it just hasn&rsquo;t materialized&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing that has been unforeseen is teams being wary of the 1st &amp; 2nd salary cap aprons. Teams just aren&rsquo;t taking money as easily and readily as they&rsquo;ve done in the past.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>TL;DR: Very unlikely Markkanen gets traded, most likely he signs an extension on August 7th or later. The Jazz will embrace youth next season, with Walker Kessler likely to reenter the starting lineup. Veterans have not been traded yet because there is no market. Utah will do whatever they can to get a Top 5 pick in the 2025 draft.</p>

<p>Really? Are they Swedish by any chance? We have an alcohol monopoly over here where the Systembolaget is only open during certain hours(1000-1900 on weekdays), closed on holidays, closes 1500 on Saturday and closed on Sunday. Not for religious reasons though, it&rsquo;s to make it harder for alcoholics to buy a bottle of vodka on a Tuesday evening, beat the wife and drink themselves to sleep and call in sick to work the day after.</p>

Just look at how bad Russian alcohol consumption is, that could have been us if we didn&rsquo;t put a stop to it.</p>

<p>Not much to do in winter when it&rsquo;s cold and dark back in the day, people would turn to drinking.</p>

The vast majority of Utahns aren’t Mormon nowadays, the number of Mormons are exaggerated.

I am not sure if they are good sources but a very strong economy focused on tech with low cost of living, low crime rate and lots of national parks. I dont see why it wouldn&rsquo;t be. Also salt lake is about 24% active Mormons. So Mormons are the minority by far in salt lake.</p>

      <label for="lfkiisb" class="commentText"><p>Pretty much a repeat of what Jones and other Jazz beat writers have been saying since the season ended. Lauri isn&rsquo;t really on the market. They&rsquo;re not shopping him. If a team wants him, they have to hit a grand slam. Otherwise, the Jazz will renegotiate and extend and will build around Lauri.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the right move. He&rsquo;s in his prime, he wants to be a Jazz player, and they&rsquo;re not a free agency destination. He has the perfect game next to a superstar. There really is no necessity to move him.</p>

<p>If the Jazz really wanna tank they can find a way to do it but I think they&rsquo;re gonna ultimately do something similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen the last two seasons. Their current roster is worse than it was going into the last two seasons though.</p>

<p>Having said that, obv if Lauri is happy in Utah then you can see why they keep him.</p>

<p>I do think there’s a decent chance it reduces their odds at a top 4 pick bc I actually like the two guys coming off rookie seasons but so be it.</p>

      <label for="lfkor82" class="commentText"><p>It depends on what they do to add. They&rsquo;re only at 12 roster players so we know they will add. Olynyk was more important to their success than people realize and Fontecchio shot very well for them. Kessler re-assuming more time of course can make up for Olynyk on a value level but their wing situation, and their PG situation, is definitely not winning material&hellip;.but if Hendricks/George do take that leap, it could change. And those two absolutely could take a jump. The experience they gained last season will be invaluable.</p>

<p>If they added Okoro and Fultz than they&rsquo;d be a competitive, spunky team for sure, but right now? Not so much to me.</p>

Puts up big stats on a terrible team, but he’s at best the #3 guy on a contending team. (prime k-love is better than him)</p>

<p>You don’t win a ring in this league with Markkanen as your #1 or #2 options. He’s a #3 guy stat padding on a bad team</p>

<p>The flattened odds do make it more possible but you will always be more likely to win the lottery with top odds. Out of the last 5 drafts, 4 have been won by bottom 3 teams</p>

<p>Even getting a top 5 pick in a draft as loaded as 2025 will help alot</p>

<p>Plenty of stars have pressured the front office to make moves (like Giannis) and when they see that the writing is on the wall, then they want to leave (like Lillard, Harden, Westbrook, AD…etc)</p>

<p>Stars will always say and promise the right things in front of the media (especially while they’re up for an extension), but they can easily get frustrated if timelines between them and the organization aren’t aligned</p>

<p>Plenty of these guys realize they can force themselves to a better situation after they sign a huge contract. It’s better to secure your money first and then figure out where you actually want to be</p>

<p>Utah’s 2025 first round draft pick is top 1-10 protected. If it falls outside the top 10, it conveys to OKC.</p>

<p>Utah with Lauri is too good to tank, but not good enough to make the playoffs. Standings purgatory.</p>

<p>If Utah wants to bottom out and draft in the lottery for the next 1-3 seasons…. Lauri will be too old by the time these projected high draft picks get experienced enough (ie how long it took Jaylen and Jayson to develop to the players they are today?)</p>

<p>so…. wtf is Utah doing?</p>

      <label for="lfkq2pv" class="commentText"><p>Pretty much basic stuff, imo.</p>

<p>Ainge had already put Lauri in the not untouchable but I would take a Godfather offer.</p>

<p>It’s a maybe a cliché but Euro players tend to stick a bit when they are moved in a place, Lauri was an AS in Utah.</p>

<p>After moving from Chicago to Cleveland and landing in Utah.</p>

<p>There is some basic smokescreen in the report because Utah definitely didn’t except Lauri to be an AS, their team is also way too good to fully tank, they’re well coached so they’re try to pivot into developing their player.</p>

<p>Lauri is just in this spot, if he pushed for a move then they would be okay if they got their Mitchell/Gobert package as reported and I don’t think Lauri will do it. They’re okay extending him because they could easily trade him later.</p>
