</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Quotes are from an interview on ESPN700 radio, I got these from  <a href="https://x.com/Dunzod/status/1818039225348202958" target="_blank">This Twitter thread</a>. Tony Jones is the Jazz beat writer for The Athletic</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>On when Markkanen will sign his extension:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I would expect him to sign on Aug. 7th, or after Aug 6th. Lauri doesn&rsquo;t want to be traded so&hellip; I expect him to do it after Aug 6th so there&rsquo;s no trade talk this year&rdquo;  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even think him signing on Aug 6th is even an option. We&rsquo;re almost 100% trending towards him signing on Aug 7th.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lauri has really taken to Utah. His family has taken to Utah. Obviously the Jazz can trade him between now and Aug 6th, and Lauri knows that, but Lauri has forged a really close relationship to Will Hardy. And Will has really found a way to unlock his career&rdquo;  &ldquo;And Lauri really recognizes that and appreciates that, and wants to be a part of the rebuild.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Jazz perspective&hellip; Lauri is 27. His game is not predicated on athleticism&hellip; His game should age well. Meaning, the Jazz are fully confident that Lauri will still be this version of Lauri, or very close to it, the next time the Jazz are, in fact, good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The likely scenario is Lauri signs on Aug 7th, the Jazz prioritize the young guys during the season, and they try to enter the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes&rdquo;   &ldquo;The thing that people are not understanding is that the Jazz are going to really prioritize the young guys from Day 1. And if they had their druthers, they would have traded Jordan Clarkson&hellip; they would have traded John Collins.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Even with that, I still think the Jazz are going to de-emphasize the veterans and are going to prioritize the young guys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the front office is going to go into this with the mindset of: we have to do anything we can to get a top 5 pick in this draft&hellip; the Jazz realize how good this draft is. And I think they are going to act accordingly, whether Lauri is on the roster or not&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spence asks Tony what he believes the Jazz rotation will look like next year in order to prioritize the young guys</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well the number one thing is Walker Kessler becomes the starting center and John Collins comes off the bench&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>On the odds of Markkanen being traded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re down to 2 things&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Number one, they re-sign Lauri and they use the bulk of their cap space, they sign their rookies, they sign Eubanks, and their business is pretty much done&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second option is they trade Lauri, they take back Brandin Podziemski from the Warriors and a whole bunch of draft picks, and they become a team where other teams can dump salary for draft compensation&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re trending towards the Jazz NOT trading Lauri. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a package out there that they are overly interested in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spence asks Tony to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 on whether he believes Lauri gets traded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would probably put it at a 2&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>On why Utah hasn&rsquo;t completely blown up the roster yet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spence explains he doesn&rsquo;t understand the direction the Jazz are going &amp; wishes they would have picked a more definitive direction</p>

<p>Tony: &ldquo;They just couldn&rsquo;t trade their veterans. You can&rsquo;t trade people if there is no one who wants to trade for them&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John (Collins) makes a little too much money. And I don&rsquo;t anticipate the Jazz being able to trade him until the last year of his contract. Jordan Clarkson is the one that surprises me because I thought he&rsquo;d have more of a market this summer, but it just hasn&rsquo;t materialized&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing that has been unforeseen is teams being wary of the 1st &amp; 2nd salary cap aprons. Teams just aren&rsquo;t taking money as easily and readily as they&rsquo;ve done in the past.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>TL;DR: Very unlikely Markkanen gets traded, most likely he signs an extension on August 7th or later. The Jazz will embrace youth next season, with Walker Kessler likely to reenter the starting lineup. Veterans have not been traded yet because there is no market. Utah will do whatever they can to get a Top 5 pick in the 2025 draft.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>3% chance of happening = 97% chance of not happening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never happen again&rdquo; = fails to happen each year.</p>

<p>Fails to happen next year = 0.97.</p>

<p>Fails to happen next year and the following year = 0.97^2 = 0.9409.</p>

<p>Fails to happen the next three years = 0.97^3, etc.</p>

<p>More likely than not = over 50% chance, so the threshold is at 0.97^x = 0.5.</p>

<p>x = log 0.5 / log 0.97 = 22.757</p>

<p>Do you&hellip; do you think I won&rsquo;t live for another 23 years? Do you think human extinction is on the horizon, or is this a personal thing? Should I be asking my doctor for a screening?</p>

<p>Really? Are they Swedish by any chance? We have an alcohol monopoly over here where the Systembolaget is only open during certain hours(1000-1900 on weekdays), closed on holidays, closes 1500 on Saturday and closed on Sunday. Not for religious reasons though, it&rsquo;s to make it harder for alcoholics to buy a bottle of vodka on a Tuesday evening, beat the wife and drink themselves to sleep and call in sick to work the day after.</p>

<p>The weather, if you don&rsquo;t mind some snow, is particularly awesome. The air is dry, removing the sting from both heat and cold (and the reason the snow is so powdery,) high elevation means it just doesn&rsquo;t get THAT hot in degrees regardless, compared to my time in TX/AZ.</p>

<p>Politically it is no more a theocracy than the south, just Mormons instead of Baptists. I&rsquo;d say (ruralish) GA is much more &lsquo;theocratic&rsquo; than Utah, as most Mormons (against the stereotype) are reticent in pushing their beliefs onto the larger population, though obviously the religion informs the morality which informs the lawmaking direction.</p>

<p>Rural towns have rural people in it and they&rsquo;re priorities are often their hobbies and (farm) work ahead of religion, like most rural folk. They&rsquo;re often more interested in what guns you own or breeds you raise before your church affiliation.</p>

<p>Even in Provo, the heart of Mormondom, you&rsquo;ll hear a polyglot of languages spoken and a diverse set of folk, though still a relatively small set of Blacks (lots of Hispanic/Islander/Asians) and a great variety of international food choices.</p>

<p>Compared to Austin, its a very different vibe, without the large amount of alcohol as a social lubricant, but it is just as sophisticated and diverse.</p>

<p>If you love the sport and it&rsquo;s more than a job to you, you should make trade demands to a contender every chance you get and try to be a third wheel in a great team to get that ring? </p>

<p>But still good enough that as the Jazz come out of rebuild they will be a consistent 5 seed type squad. So he gets some playoffs, a nice place to live and a bag. </p>

For once you have star that wants to be loyal and stay on the team when they are struggling and that makes him somehow worth less? Like you wouldnt want that in a guy? Rather have dudes who will bounce and demand trades every other season to the next hot contender?</p>

<p> Like for example in European soccer the fans love the guys who will stay on the same team and they elevate into legends. </p>

      <label for="lfkiisb" class="commentText"><p>Pretty much a repeat of what Jones and other Jazz beat writers have been saying since the season ended. Lauri isn&rsquo;t really on the market. They&rsquo;re not shopping him. If a team wants him, they have to hit a grand slam. Otherwise, the Jazz will renegotiate and extend and will build around Lauri.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the right move. He&rsquo;s in his prime, he wants to be a Jazz player, and they&rsquo;re not a free agency destination. He has the perfect game next to a superstar. There really is no necessity to move him.</p>

<p>If the Jazz really wanna tank they can find a way to do it but I think they&rsquo;re gonna ultimately do something similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen the last two seasons. Their current roster is worse than it was going into the last two seasons though.</p>

<p>Having said that, obv if Lauri is happy in Utah then you can see why they keep him.</p>

<p>I do think there’s a decent chance it reduces their odds at a top 4 pick bc I actually like the two guys coming off rookie seasons but so be it.</p>

      <label for="lfkor82" class="commentText"><p>It depends on what they do to add. They&rsquo;re only at 12 roster players so we know they will add. Olynyk was more important to their success than people realize and Fontecchio shot very well for them. Kessler re-assuming more time of course can make up for Olynyk on a value level but their wing situation, and their PG situation, is definitely not winning material&hellip;.but if Hendricks/George do take that leap, it could change. And those two absolutely could take a jump. The experience they gained last season will be invaluable.</p>

<p>If they added Okoro and Fultz than they&rsquo;d be a competitive, spunky team for sure, but right now? Not so much to me.</p>

<p>Charlotte could be better if Lamelo stays healthy but he hasn’t been able to. Pistons, Bulls, Nets, Wizards and Blazers will all be worse</p>

      <label for="lfny34a" class="commentText"><p>There fine, but they are also more redundant in skill set. Clarkson isn’t that good any more, and Collins is a huge negative on defense. There were some nights I forgot he was even playing.</p>

<p>Sexton is good, but we have a large sample at this point of score 1st, defensively bad guards not contributing to win in that much. And Kessler is great defensively but still bad offensively. The only change is he’ll get more minutes.</p>

<p>Fontecchio are Olynyk were the only true 3&amp;D and the only natural passer respectively. Olynyk in particular was key for Lauri, who isn’t an amazing shot creator and needs good passers.</p>

<p>Again the exact same team minus the rooks went 1-11 with Lauri after the deadline. They’re by no means a bottom 5 lock, but I don’t think it’s a stretch either. </p>

      <label for="lfnz3f1" class="commentText"><p>I’m basing it on the players on the roster. Wizards, Pistons, Bulls, Nets, and Blazers are all worse. Sure the Jazz had a bad stretch last season but they’ve been close to .500 most of the time Lauri is there and while worse are still better on paper than the other teams.</p>

<p>KO isn’t a 3&amp;D player, just 3. I think it’s time to go to Kessler who showed a lot of promise his rookie year and is a far better defender. Sexton, Clarkson, Lauri, Collins, Kessler isn’t a great lineup but it’s still a lot better than the teams who are trying to tank with the possible exception of the Hornets if they can stay healthy</p>

      <label for="lfo3zcg" class="commentText"><p>Agree to disagree on that then I guess. I see them in the same tier as the Hornets, Pistons and Bulls. I’d only have the Blazers, Wizards and Nets as definitely worse at this point.</p>

<p>KO was the natural passer I referred to, Fontecchio was the 3&amp;D guy. KO didn’t take minutes from Kessler regardless, he played the 4 as much as he did the 5 in Utah. Collins is the bigger threat to Kesslers minutes, and is still on the roster. </p>

<p>Sexton, George, Hendricks, Lauri, Kessler is how I’d project be he starters. Clarkson won’t be starting, and it’s unlikely Collins will. If he is, it either means Kessler is sitting or they’re playing together, which was horrible last year. </p>

<p>Seems we just see things differently. I think you’re giving a few of the Jazz vets more credit than they deserve, but I guess we’ll see as the season unfolds. </p>

Thats not a significantly better team, both those guys struggled a lot last year. Bulls lost Derozan who was easily their best player and it looks like they have finally made a decision to tank. Colby White is solid but not at Lauris level. The Hornets I think we agree on it but it depends on their health which hasn’t worked out 3 of the past 4 seasons</p>

<p>It’s all speculation till it happens but if Lauri values stability and making money over being on a team that is competitive during his prime than this is the perfect place for him to remain.</p>

<p>Ainge just wants to fleece for the sake of the fleece and if Lauri doesn’t have a desire to really compete than whatever team he gets moved to will be miserable anyways. Especially after said team is gutted.</p>

I have no reason to doubt this dude&rsquo;s reporting at all, but no one in Utah (Lauri or the FO) is going to say they think a trade is likely because that&rsquo;s public leverage against them. Just like the Warriors or Spurs FO is going to say they&rsquo;re happy with the teams they currently have even if they&rsquo;re desperate for Markkanen.</p>

<p>Does make sense that Markkanen says he&rsquo;s not signing on August 6th, though. Getting traded midseason would suck. That&rsquo;s about the only news you can take from this.</p>

      <label for="lfkqsmh" class="commentText"><p>This is why it&rsquo;s crucial that we trade John Collins and Jordan Clarkson. The rookies and sophomores will make enough mistakes to lose even with Lauri and Sexton. I&rsquo;d honestly be ok with trading Sexton too, but I&rsquo;d love him as a sixth man in the future</p>

<p>The flattened odds do make it more possible but you will always be more likely to win the lottery with top odds. Out of the last 5 drafts, 4 have been won by bottom 3 teams</p>

<p>Even getting a top 5 pick in a draft as loaded as 2025 will help alot</p>

You don’t wanna be so bad that you can’t get good again, but you do wanna maximize odds to move up. This draft has 5 potential franchise talents, I’m hoping the Jazz can get one of them.</p>

      <label for="lflateq" class="commentText"><p>Zach Lowe already mentioned this in his latest podcast… Can Utah make up their mind?</p>

<p>Utah’s 2025 first round draft pick is top 1-10 protected. If it falls outside the top 10, it conveys to OKC.</p>

<p>Utah with Lauri is too good to tank, but not good enough to make the playoffs. Standings purgatory.</p>

<p>If Utah wants to bottom out and draft in the lottery for the next 1-3 seasons…. Lauri will be too old by the time these projected high draft picks get experienced enough (ie how long it took Jaylen and Jayson to develop to the players they are today?)</p>

<p>so…. wtf is Utah doing?</p>

<p>The question isn’t about keeping their pick or drafting in the lotto, that’s fine. It’s about whether they can keep Lauri and be bad enough to pick top 5. Which hard to say at this point.</p>

<p>Plenty of stars have pressured the front office to make moves (like Giannis) and when they see that the writing is on the wall, then they want to leave (like Lillard, Harden, Westbrook, AD…etc)</p>

<p>Stars will always say and promise the right things in front of the media (especially while they’re up for an extension), but they can easily get frustrated if timelines between them and the organization aren’t aligned</p>

<p>Plenty of these guys realize they can force themselves to a better situation after they sign a huge contract. It’s better to secure your money first and then figure out where you actually want to be</p>

      <label for="lfkq2pv" class="commentText"><p>Pretty much basic stuff, imo.</p>

<p>Ainge had already put Lauri in the not untouchable but I would take a Godfather offer.</p>

<p>It’s a maybe a cliché but Euro players tend to stick a bit when they are moved in a place, Lauri was an AS in Utah.</p>

<p>After moving from Chicago to Cleveland and landing in Utah.</p>

<p>There is some basic smokescreen in the report because Utah definitely didn’t except Lauri to be an AS, their team is also way too good to fully tank, they’re well coached so they’re try to pivot into developing their player.</p>

<p>Lauri is just in this spot, if he pushed for a move then they would be okay if they got their Mitchell/Gobert package as reported and I don’t think Lauri will do it. They’re okay extending him because they could easily trade him later.</p>
