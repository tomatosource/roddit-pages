</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Quotes are from an interview on ESPN700 radio, I got these from  <a href="https://x.com/Dunzod/status/1818039225348202958" target="_blank">This Twitter thread</a>. Tony Jones is the Jazz beat writer for The Athletic</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>On when Markkanen will sign his extension:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I would expect him to sign on Aug. 7th, or after Aug 6th. Lauri doesn&rsquo;t want to be traded so&hellip; I expect him to do it after Aug 6th so there&rsquo;s no trade talk this year&rdquo;  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even think him signing on Aug 6th is even an option. We&rsquo;re almost 100% trending towards him signing on Aug 7th.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lauri has really taken to Utah. His family has taken to Utah. Obviously the Jazz can trade him between now and Aug 6th, and Lauri knows that, but Lauri has forged a really close relationship to Will Hardy. And Will has really found a way to unlock his career&rdquo;  &ldquo;And Lauri really recognizes that and appreciates that, and wants to be a part of the rebuild.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Jazz perspective&hellip; Lauri is 27. His game is not predicated on athleticism&hellip; His game should age well. Meaning, the Jazz are fully confident that Lauri will still be this version of Lauri, or very close to it, the next time the Jazz are, in fact, good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The likely scenario is Lauri signs on Aug 7th, the Jazz prioritize the young guys during the season, and they try to enter the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes&rdquo;   &ldquo;The thing that people are not understanding is that the Jazz are going to really prioritize the young guys from Day 1. And if they had their druthers, they would have traded Jordan Clarkson&hellip; they would have traded John Collins.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Even with that, I still think the Jazz are going to de-emphasize the veterans and are going to prioritize the young guys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the front office is going to go into this with the mindset of: we have to do anything we can to get a top 5 pick in this draft&hellip; the Jazz realize how good this draft is. And I think they are going to act accordingly, whether Lauri is on the roster or not&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spence asks Tony what he believes the Jazz rotation will look like next year in order to prioritize the young guys</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well the number one thing is Walker Kessler becomes the starting center and John Collins comes off the bench&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>On the odds of Markkanen being traded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re down to 2 things&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Number one, they re-sign Lauri and they use the bulk of their cap space, they sign their rookies, they sign Eubanks, and their business is pretty much done&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second option is they trade Lauri, they take back Brandin Podziemski from the Warriors and a whole bunch of draft picks, and they become a team where other teams can dump salary for draft compensation&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re trending towards the Jazz NOT trading Lauri. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a package out there that they are overly interested in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spence asks Tony to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 on whether he believes Lauri gets traded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would probably put it at a 2&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>On why Utah hasn&rsquo;t completely blown up the roster yet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spence explains he doesn&rsquo;t understand the direction the Jazz are going &amp; wishes they would have picked a more definitive direction</p>

<p>Tony: &ldquo;They just couldn&rsquo;t trade their veterans. You can&rsquo;t trade people if there is no one who wants to trade for them&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John (Collins) makes a little too much money. And I don&rsquo;t anticipate the Jazz being able to trade him until the last year of his contract. Jordan Clarkson is the one that surprises me because I thought he&rsquo;d have more of a market this summer, but it just hasn&rsquo;t materialized&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing that has been unforeseen is teams being wary of the 1st &amp; 2nd salary cap aprons. Teams just aren&rsquo;t taking money as easily and readily as they&rsquo;ve done in the past.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>TL;DR: Very unlikely Markkanen gets traded, most likely he signs an extension on August 7th or later. The Jazz will embrace youth next season, with Walker Kessler likely to reenter the starting lineup. Veterans have not been traded yet because there is no market. Utah will do whatever they can to get a Top 5 pick in the 2025 draft.</p>

<p>Really? Are they Swedish by any chance? We have an alcohol monopoly over here where the Systembolaget is only open during certain hours(1000-1900 on weekdays), closed on holidays, closes 1500 on Saturday and closed on Sunday. Not for religious reasons though, it&rsquo;s to make it harder for alcoholics to buy a bottle of vodka on a Tuesday evening, beat the wife and drink themselves to sleep and call in sick to work the day after.</p>

It’s hard not to be aware of the air quality issues in general (winter inversions, summer smog, etc). But not everyone is caught up with how toxic that soil is, and that it’s already happening in certain hot spots.</p>

<p>Outside of those groups, in my experience hardly anyone even knows the lake is drying up, let alone the ramifications.</p>

      <label for="lflh39y" class="commentText"><p>Recently moved back from Texas to Utah after living sequentially in UT, AZ, GA, TX, UT. It had been since the mid 90s I&rsquo;ve lived in Utah.</p>

<p>The weather, if you don&rsquo;t mind some snow, is particularly awesome. The air is dry, removing the sting from both heat and cold (and the reason the snow is so powdery,) high elevation means it just doesn&rsquo;t get THAT hot in degrees regardless, compared to my time in TX/AZ.</p>

<p>Politically it is no more a theocracy than the south, just Mormons instead of Baptists. I&rsquo;d say (ruralish) GA is much more &lsquo;theocratic&rsquo; than Utah, as most Mormons (against the stereotype) are reticent in pushing their beliefs onto the larger population, though obviously the religion informs the morality which informs the lawmaking direction.</p>

<p>Rural towns have rural people in it and they&rsquo;re priorities are often their hobbies and (farm) work ahead of religion, like most rural folk. They&rsquo;re often more interested in what guns you own or breeds you raise before your church affiliation.</p>

<p>Even in Provo, the heart of Mormondom, you&rsquo;ll hear a polyglot of languages spoken and a diverse set of folk, though still a relatively small set of Blacks (lots of Hispanic/Islander/Asians) and a great variety of international food choices.</p>

<p>Compared to Austin, its a very different vibe, without the large amount of alcohol as a social lubricant, but it is just as sophisticated and diverse.</p>

I am not sure if they are good sources but a very strong economy focused on tech with low cost of living, low crime rate and lots of national parks. I dont see why it wouldn&rsquo;t be. Also salt lake is about 24% active Mormons. So Mormons are the minority by far in salt lake.</p>

The vast majority of Utahns aren’t Mormon nowadays, the number of Mormons are exaggerated. It overall depends on where you live in Utah, Salt Lake County is a lot more progressive compared to Utah and Washington County.</p>

Fast growing economy and you can choose to live a family lifestyle in the suburbs, a more normal lifestyle in the city, or be a cool granola cruncher type in Park City. It’s not nice if you like the ocean or can’t stand Mormons or their politics, and you do need to plan ahead with alcohol.</p>

<p>But still good enough that as the Jazz come out of rebuild they will be a consistent 5 seed type squad. So he gets some playoffs, a nice place to live and a bag. </p>

      <label for="lfkiisb" class="commentText"><p>Pretty much a repeat of what Jones and other Jazz beat writers have been saying since the season ended. Lauri isn&rsquo;t really on the market. They&rsquo;re not shopping him. If a team wants him, they have to hit a grand slam. Otherwise, the Jazz will renegotiate and extend and will build around Lauri.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the right move. He&rsquo;s in his prime, he wants to be a Jazz player, and they&rsquo;re not a free agency destination. He has the perfect game next to a superstar. There really is no necessity to move him.</p>

<p>If the Jazz really wanna tank they can find a way to do it but I think they&rsquo;re gonna ultimately do something similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen the last two seasons. Their current roster is worse than it was going into the last two seasons though.</p>

<p>Having said that, obv if Lauri is happy in Utah then you can see why they keep him.</p>

<p>I do think there’s a decent chance it reduces their odds at a top 4 pick bc I actually like the two guys coming off rookie seasons but so be it.</p>

      <label for="lfkor82" class="commentText"><p>It depends on what they do to add. They&rsquo;re only at 12 roster players so we know they will add. Olynyk was more important to their success than people realize and Fontecchio shot very well for them. Kessler re-assuming more time of course can make up for Olynyk on a value level but their wing situation, and their PG situation, is definitely not winning material&hellip;.but if Hendricks/George do take that leap, it could change. And those two absolutely could take a jump. The experience they gained last season will be invaluable.</p>

<p>If they added Okoro and Fultz than they&rsquo;d be a competitive, spunky team for sure, but right now? Not so much to me.</p>

<p>top 5 picks were half of the all NBA teams. which means the other 55 picks contributed only 50% of the all nba teams.</p>

<p>the value of a pick drastically drops off after the first couple of picks.</p>

<p>And the floor of a top 3 pick is also typically much much higher.</p>

<p>Put another way, do you think anyone would trade a top 3 pick for a 7th and 10th pick? usually no.</p>

<p>The flattened odds do make it more possible but you will always be more likely to win the lottery with top odds. Out of the last 5 drafts, 4 have been won by bottom 3 teams</p>

<p>Even getting a top 5 pick in a draft as loaded as 2025 will help alot</p>

      <label for="lflsixt" class="commentText"><p>I mean, the thing is that it&rsquo;s in every player&rsquo;s best interest to say they want to be in whatever city they&rsquo;re currently in publicly, even if they&rsquo;re demanding to be traded privately. I have no reason to doubt this dude&rsquo;s reporting at all, but no one in Utah (Lauri or the FO) is going to say they think a trade is likely because that&rsquo;s public leverage against them. Just like the Warriors or Spurs FO is going to say they&rsquo;re happy with the teams they currently have even if they&rsquo;re desperate for Markkanen.</p>

<p>Does make sense that Markkanen says he&rsquo;s not signing on August 6th, though. Getting traded midseason would suck. That&rsquo;s about the only news you can take from this.</p>

<p>Utah’s 2025 first round draft pick is top 1-10 protected. If it falls outside the top 10, it conveys to OKC.</p>

<p>Utah with Lauri is too good to tank, but not good enough to make the playoffs. Standings purgatory.</p>

<p>If Utah wants to bottom out and draft in the lottery for the next 1-3 seasons…. Lauri will be too old by the time these projected high draft picks get experienced enough (ie how long it took Jaylen and Jayson to develop to the players they are today?)</p>

<p>so…. wtf is Utah doing?</p>

<p>Plenty of star players are initially fine to be part of a rebuild until the media starts piling on them and people start questioning their impact</p>

      <label for="lfkp7vw" class="commentText"><p>I didn’t even mention anything about a ‘big market’, I’m talking about star players being frustrated in rebuilding environments</p>

<p>Plenty of stars have pressured the front office to make moves (like Giannis) and when they see that the writing is on the wall, then they want to leave (like Lillard, Harden, Westbrook, AD…etc)</p>

<p>Stars will always say and promise the right things in front of the media (especially while they’re up for an extension), but they can easily get frustrated if timelines between them and the organization aren’t aligned</p>

<p>Plenty of these guys realize they can force themselves to a better situation after they sign a huge contract. It’s better to secure your money first and then figure out where you actually want to be</p>

<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of teams tanking this season. I don&rsquo;t see them cracking the top 5 without the lottery going their way.</p>

      <label for="lfkq2pv" class="commentText"><p>Pretty much basic stuff, imo.</p>

<p>Ainge had already put Lauri in the not untouchable but I would take a Godfather offer.</p>

<p>It’s a maybe a cliché but Euro players tend to stick a bit when they are moved in a place, Lauri was an AS in Utah.</p>

<p>After moving from Chicago to Cleveland and landing in Utah.</p>

<p>There is some basic smokescreen in the report because Utah definitely didn’t except Lauri to be an AS, their team is also way too good to fully tank, they’re well coached so they’re try to pivot into developing their player.</p>

<p>Lauri is just in this spot, if he pushed for a move then they would be okay if they got their Mitchell/Gobert package as reported and I don’t think Lauri will do it. They’re okay extending him because they could easily trade him later.</p>
