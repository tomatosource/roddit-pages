      <label for="lens6sm" class="commentText"><p>Detroit&rsquo;s issue is they never had the players to flip for a truckload of assets the way OKC did with Westbrook and PG. The Thunder were able to trade those two for a combined 7 1st round picks and 4 1st round pick swaps along with an MVP candidate. All Detroit has been able to do is just lose games on purpose and hope for good lottery odds.</p>

<p>By the time that Chet works out all of the rookie growing pains SGA will be 30. It’s not that they can’t win, it’s that it would be better to have players that are refined and don’t make the kind of mistakes that young and learning players do. If Ant was a more refined player, that he will be one day, maybe the Timberwolves win it all. If KAT is traded maybe they can be better set for next year.</p>

<p>It’s about finding who you are building around and setting them as your timeline instead of taking a team roster approach that leaves you with players suffering development crunch and your team direction not going anywhere. </p>

<p>Would the Wizards have been worse off if they played Deni as a point forward with Rui and tried to build a team based on them? Would they be any worse if they traded Beal away after drafting Rui and tanked for a year or two? In 3 years, if Alex Sarr develops perfectly where will they be? </p>

<p>After drafting Boogie Cousins, the Kings spent the next 5 years getting</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jimmer Fredette - 10 (via trade)</p></li>

<li><p>Thomas Robinson - 5</p></li>

<li><p>Ben McLemore - 7</p></li>

<li><p>Nik Stauskas - 8</p></li>

<li><p>Willie Cauley-Stein - 6</p></li>

<p>Were they actively tanking all those years, probably not. But that&rsquo;s pretty terrible.</p>

<p>Cousins really wanted to go to the NJ Nets but they went with Derrick Favors who was seen as more upside and was later flipped to the Jazz for Deron Williams.</p>

<p>If the Nets went Cousins do the Kings take the upside of Favors and make that list look even worse or maybe get lucky with a higher pick.</p>

      <label for="leqae5p" class="commentText"><p>The owners were actively trying to torpedo the franchise to move it to Seattle.</p>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a tank job. It was purposeful malpractice.</p>

<p>They thought if they really tried to make a dog shit team, that the fans would stop coming to the games so they could move the team. Now that plan would probably haves worked with about 90 percent of franchises but the kings fans were so nuts they formed a grass roots movement to save the team and build one of the best arenas in the nba.</p>

<p>Then Vivek took over and truly didn&rsquo;t understand the sport. Like he wanted a player to cherry pick under the basketball every play because the tactic worked for his daughters u9 team. (literally couldn&rsquo;t make this shit up).</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t sign Rondo or Rudy Gay when your tanking. You don&rsquo;t hire a hall of fame coach when ur trying to tank.</p>

<p>They truly only began to tank when they traded boogie. That team was trying to win but sucked at basketball</p>

<p>I think what has helped it some is the play-in. A lot more potential playoff revenue on the line for teams in the 9 or 10 seed than there was a few years ago and it&rsquo;s more embarrassing to tank out of that unless you start early.</p>

Josh Hart was a journeyman who found a home. We drafted Mitch Robinson. We signed IHart as a backup and he played so well he priced us out. We got OG because we traded picks and talent we drafted later in the draft. The only &ldquo;big name&rdquo; free agent was Randle and he&rsquo;s not exactly a name that you think would turn the franchise around.

In the NFL the Pistons would be set after those first two-three seasons. What&rsquo;s the point of the draft if the worst team gets the 5th pick. They already can&rsquo;t get free agents, the cap fucks you up and now you have aprons to deal with and the one out isn&rsquo;t even an out it&rsquo;s a roulette wheel.</p>

      <label for="leo3e18" class="commentText"><p>That ignores how draft picks work and the reality of the James Harden Draft. There’s hardly been any big moves in the lottery in the last 3 years. All the rockets got were some additional picks that were later in the draft. Give Detroit or the Wizards those picks and they waste them.</p>

<p>It’s about management and front office structure. The pistons have one of the worst nepotism in the NBA, they suck at development/scouting/ and recruitment and it leads to an organization that can’t find talent or loses it. The Pacers have done better than the Pistons despite NEVER having a number 1 overall pick, or even having a #1 play for them.  </p>

<p>Nah. It was done to teach all the kids how to win.</p>

<p>The salary floor was passed by a large margin to bring in as much of the best talent possible.</p>

<p>Made plays on 3 of the biggest names in FA (2 of whom were gotten and then relied on heavily), because ownership wanted to add as many wins as possible as quickly as possible.</p>

      <label for="lemy1nc" class="commentText"><p>If LeBron hadn&rsquo;t come to save the day, the Lakers drafting of D&rsquo;Lo, Ingram, and Lonzo with three #2 picks in successive years would be under more scrutiny. Even in a universe where Lonzo stays healthy, that&rsquo;s the core of an 8 seed first round exit type of team.</p>

<p>Meanwhile their rival Celtics win a chip largely on the back of three guys who were all available with those picks (Zinger, Brown, and Tatum).</p>

      <label for="lenkmeb" class="commentText"><p>Tatum was never in the cards for LA. Remember, Boston had the #1 in the draft. Their guy was Tatum. If they thought the Lakers were going to draft Tatum, they wouldn’t have traded down. Because everyone and their mother knew the Lakers wanted Lonzo, they felt safe trading down and drafting Tatum 3rd.</p>

<p>Every highlight they showed of Lonzo wasn&rsquo;t impressive to say the least.  You just had to know with a father as blustery as Lavar to stay 10 miles away from his son.</p>

<p>Magic Johnson was a helluva player but a terrible coach and a terrible GM.</p>

<p>The near consensus during that time was that the clear 1 and 2 were Lonzo and Fultz. Tatum wasn&rsquo;t even the consensus 3 or 4, as most had Josh Jackson above him and some had Fox over him too.</p>

<p>Lonzo was an elite prospect, he would&rsquo;ve went top 3 with anyone as his parents</p>

<p>The draft is always going to encourage revisionism, but in this case those picks (Porzingis-Brown-Tatum) happened almost immediately after LA&rsquo;s selections, which makes it more egregious that they missed all of those guys.</p>

I feel like unlike the Pistons just completely missing on some of these, no one could&rsquo;ve foreseen Fultz&rsquo; shoulder issue after his great college season or Simmons just having a horrendous fall off whether it be mental issues or his back.</p>

<p>No one would&rsquo;ve passed on Simmons that year despite some of the red flags coming out of LSU.</p>

<p>They just had a terribly built team last season. They had no shooting, no rim protection, no secondary playmaking. Cade had zero space to operate and the team was horribly built to capitalize on his strengths.</p>

      <label for="lepc8bv" class="commentText"><p>Cade is a real NBA player, for sure. So that&rsquo;s a level of success. You&rsquo;re right that the context has made it extremely difficult to evaluate how good he is beyond that. Will he be a consistent All Star, or an All-NBA type at his prime? I really still don&rsquo;t know, because we basically haven&rsquo;t seen him play with a representative NBA team yet.</p>

<p>Ivey as a pick made sense, and like Cunningham there&rsquo;s obviously still evaluation to do. But the evidence so far is not as promising. </p>

<p>Thompson is currently a one-way player, but the defensive package offers enough to invest in trying to develop some offense; this is way more promising so far than Ivey.</p>

<p>Holland&rsquo;s evaluation hasn&rsquo;t really even started yet; most of what we&rsquo;ve seen from him came from a totally dysfunctional Ignite team. His summer league play seemed a good start on balance.</p>

<p>The two biggest problems for the Pistons are that they&rsquo;re years into this without a clear star yet (not even an Alperen Sengun-tier success so far!) and that they&rsquo;ve been trying to carry out talent evaluation in a team context that doesn&rsquo;t make even minimal structural sense. The first of those is hard to control, but they took great steps to address the second going into this coming season. At this point, they just need a bit of luck to finally go their way.</p>

I agree it was a quick turnaround, but for going completely scorched earth, to really only get 1 long term piece out of 3 years where you win 47 games total, and trading every single thing of value including 2 All Stars in Jrue Holiday and Andre Iguodala? It’s a pretty poor return. Especially with Embiid being plagued by injuries.</p>

      <label for="lenltp7" class="commentText"><p>Well the team was incredibly mediocre from 2005 to 2012, I don’t know if we count that as a tank job. And Iggy was traded for Bynum in order to make a playoff push, not as part of the process. The years we explicitly tanked were 2014, 2015, 2016, and part of 2017 after Embiid got hurt again. Saric and Simmons were both traded for All-Stars.</p>

<p>Like the roster was obviously not managed great but still it bettered the franchise overall. I don’t get that how that compares to teams like Detroit that hasn’t drafted an All-Star player in like 6 years. And I’d argue the Lakers and Knicks in the same stretch of the Process had worse results on paper, they tanked hard for 3-4 years too and the best players they got respectively were Ingram and Porzingis. They made betters move than us following that, but are we counting post-tank roster management as part of these “tank jobs”?</p>

      <label for="leo3jo6" class="commentText"><p>The only reason why the Process looks like that was because the league forced the Sixers to fire Hinkie and end the Process. Among the Process&rsquo; core tenets was that the draft was the best way to acquire talent, but that the draft was random and it was ideal to accumulate as many picks as possible rather than the highest possible picks to maximize the chances of getting star talent. Other tenets were that picks should always be made for best pick available rather than fit, and that young players that were to be traded should be traded for more picks and not for older star talent.</p>

<p>Colangelo was the one who made all the win-now or for-fit trades like ones for Butler, Tobi, and Ersan Ilyasova. Covington, Saric, Shamet, and Jerami Grant are the types of players you would want to surround Embiid/Simmons with, and the post-Hinkie Sixers traded them all away to prematurely go all-in.</p>

<p>Hinkie also never would have traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith since he believed in drafting for BPA rather than fit like Colangelo did. Colangelo also was the one who traded up for Fultz, giving up an extra first-rounder for virtually no reason, and dumped Richaun Holmes for free.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the Sixers would&rsquo;ve won a ring, but if they had stuck to the Process without making all-in/fit trades, they could&rsquo;ve had a roster that looked something like:</p>

<p>Starters: Simmons, Bridges, Grant, Covington, Embiid</p>

<p>Bench: Fultz, Shamet, Saric, Holmes</p>

<p>I would think that this roster could&rsquo;ve gone as far as the Sixers have gone over the last 7 or so years, and this isn&rsquo;t even accounting for the post-Colangelo picks like Maxey, Isaiah Joe, or Paul Reed.</p>

      <label for="lep2s9s" class="commentText"><p>The problem is that the “core tenet” of just randomly accumulating draft picks is clearly wrong. The draft is somewhat random but you have to actually develop talent, not just draft as many players as humanly possible. A big part of the Process was racking up second rounders and draft and stashes, none of which paid off for the Sixers.</p>

<p>A lot of the “Hinkie was wronged!” people on this sub act like the dude that drafted Okafor and was so proud of that pick he called him out in his farewell letter was this basketball super genius would have made all these miracle trades, even though none of his actual trades were particularly savvy aside from accumulating many draft picks, most of which he missed on.</p>

McConnell was also only in Philly for his rookie deal, Jerami Grant was in Philly for even less time than that and wasn’t good for them, RoCo was not only undrafted, so his acquisition was entirely unrelated to tanking, he didn’t even start his career with the Sixers lol.</p>

      <label for="lepr4vh" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this was gonna be my answer, they’re far from the worst but for how much they committed to tanking vs what they got out of it is pretty terrible.</p>

<p>Obviously they nailed it with embiid, but he’s a 31 year old mvp that still hasn’t been out of the second round.</p>

<p>They got unlucky they happened to tank in the okafor and Noel drafts, those were both pretty shitty drafts at the top (outside of KAT as the obvious first overall). Can’t really blame them for that, most other teams would’ve made the same pick.</p>

<p>Simmons is the one that really hurts, if he ever developed his game at all he could’ve been a great player. But there were signs going back all the way to lsu, and he was shown to be unplayable in the playoffs years before the big meltdown, they should have traded him when his value was high, long before 2020. Idk how any professional gm team ever thought you could win anything with a pg that teams don’t even have to guard in the playoffs. It didn’t help that the colangelos wanted to build the team around Ben instead of embiid since he was their pick.</p>

<p>Fultz was bad. I know he was good in college, but it’s not like he was some amazing standout. If you have a small guard that looks like shit when he works out for you, the team with the first overall pick is more than happy to trade down so you can pick him, just take a step back for a second…and don’t fucking pick him.</p>

<p>They had bridges too and basically gave him up for nothing before he ever played.</p>

<p>And I’m sorry, letting harden go when he was perfectly willing to take less than the max still makes no sense to me. His chemistry with Maxey was fire and you cannot tell me he and embiid wouldn’t have been even better together with more time. He also was the only thing that made them look like a real nba offense and just made every player on the court so much better. Not to mention you know you’ll actually be able to play him 37 mpg every game. Instead they wasted a year and embiids best playoff series ever, only to sign hardens worse team mate who is injury prone and obviously declining, not to mention decent perimeter shooting and defense are much easier to replace than what harden does, to a four year max.</p>

<p>Their defense is also like non existent when embiid is out, harden could at least keep them afloat record wise by making the offense so much better, a maxey PG iso fest is not gonna do the same.</p>

<p>It just makes no sense to me, I feel like a harden and maxey backcourt plus embiid would be way better than maxey, PG, and embiid. Harden has also gotten more athletic every season since the hamstring and has shown he can still carry you for a couple games in the playoffs against elite teams as a supposed to be second/third option when everyone else is shitting the bed.</p>

<p>I also find it hard to believe PG having his most efficient season ever at 34, the one season he played with harden, is a coincidence.</p>

<p>I like Maxey a lot and think he’s great as a secondary ballhandler. But people are acting like he’s capable of running the offense full time at an elite level. He’s not, at least not yet. I don’t think PG will ever look as good as he did last season again.</p>

<p>It just seems like such a desperation point move, especially considering morey is the gm, giving current PG a four year max was probably painful for him and only something he would do if he was desperate.</p>

      <label for="lenr0pm" class="commentText"><p>Post Dwight era Magic actually drafted decently but with no game changers. But Hennigan, being one of the worst GMs of all time traded the 2 best picks he made for 56 games of Serge Ibaka.</p>

<p>2013 - pick 2 - Victor Oladipo</p>

<p>2014 - pick 4 - Aaron Gordon</p>

<p>2014 - pick 12 - Dario Saric -&amp;gt; traded for Elfrid Payton</p>

<p>2015 - pick 5 - Mario Hezonja</p>

<p>2016 - pick 11 - Domantas Sabonis</p>

<p>2017 - pick 6 - Jonathan Isaac</p>

<p>2018 - pick 6 - Mo Bamba</p>

<p>So traded the two best picks, drafted two straight up busts and finally we are getting production from Jonathan Isaac.</p>

<p>P Will has been underwhelming but has played his full career as the 5th option on offense with little playmaking.</p>

<p>Ayo was an absolute steal in the second round.</p>

<p>Terry will get playing time this year so who knows.</p>

<p>Matas looks really promising but hasn&rsquo;t played yet.</p>

They were picks 7, 4, and 7 though so they&rsquo;re not busts either, I can&rsquo;t remember how bad their lottery luck was in those years.</p>

<p>The rebuild got the Knicks absolutely nowhere, it was free agency that saved them (Randle in 2020 and Brunson in 2022). If we didn’t sign those two free agents we would still be picking in the lottery probably</p>

But Embiid isn’t going to be in his prime for very much longer, honestly he might not even be in the NBA in five years, and they really don’t have much to show for it.</p>

      <label for="leo10mn" class="commentText"><p>How can you even ask that? It&rsquo;s the Sixers hands down. Of course there are different ways to judge &ldquo;worst results,&rdquo; and if you&rsquo;re going just by lottery balls then yeah other teams got lower picks. But if you&rsquo;re judging by how badly they fucked it up, it&rsquo;s gotta be the Sixers.</p>

<p>They tanked harder, longer, and more intentionally than any team ever. They were literally proud of their tank job. They gave it a nickname. They made it part of their core identity as a franchise. Their fans celebrated the fact that they were losers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna list all the ways they fucked up the rebuild because that would take hours and hopefully you already know a lot of it. Just a friendly reminder that they traded Mikal Bridges on draft night for a guy who&rsquo;s played a grand total of 13 games in the NBA.</p>

<p>The point is they bailed out of a good team with Jrue Holiday and other promising young players in order to be garbage for like five years, and a decade later they have nothing to show for it except a couple trips to the second round. Absolutely pathetic.</p>

      <label for="len999f" class="commentText"><p>Well to be fair, Detroit’s dumpster fire of a rebuild is not strictly about the position of the picks. There were good players available when they took Killian Hayes. That was like throwing a lottery pick in the toilet. Aside from Cade it remains to be seen whether or not they got great value with any of the other picks.</p>

<p>Troy Weaver also boned us with a bunch of terrible moves, so there was that. We traded two seconds for Marvin Bagley, then signed him for way too much money, then gave up two more seconds to trade him in the first year of the deal. That isn’t a franchise killing error, but when you apply that same ineptitude to everything you do as a franchise, you get a 14 win season and a 28 game losing streak. And, evidently, the fifth pick three years in a row.</p>

<p>2022 they would have to reach 7 picks to Jalen Williams in order to  pick someone who is an objectively, clearly better pick than Jaden Ivey. I don&rsquo;t think I remember any team who ever reached that far while in the lottery, so I&rsquo;ll spare blame on that pick too</p>

<p>2023 remains to be seen, the pistons took the highest upside player available, 2024 remains to be seen as well</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think any of these draft picks were truly awful like KANGS picking Papa Giannis and Willey Cauley stein in back to back drafts while holding an all nba center</p>

<p>Except they never committed to it. They tried every year to get better. They never flipped assets like Bogdanovic because they needed him to compete, despite having one promising player (Cade) and nothing else.</p>

<p>The record for teams that actually tank and manage to sustain it is really good. It&rsquo;s when ownership pulls the plug that it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
