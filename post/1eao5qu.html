The Rockets were labeled as being disgraceful to the league in how bad and uncultured they were and are now promising in the same timespine the Pistons have been tanking. Pistons are literally the never do drugs of tanking.  lmao</p>

      <label for="lens6sm" class="commentText"><p>Detroit&rsquo;s issue is they never had the players to flip for a truckload of assets the way OKC did with Westbrook and PG. The Thunder were able to trade those two for a combined 7 1st round picks and 4 1st round pick swaps along with an MVP candidate. All Detroit has been able to do is just lose games on purpose and hope for good lottery odds.</p>

<p>After drafting Boogie Cousins, the Kings spent the next 5 years getting</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jimmer Fredette - 10 (via trade)</p></li>

<li><p>Thomas Robinson - 5</p></li>

<li><p>Ben McLemore - 7</p></li>

<li><p>Nik Stauskas - 8</p></li>

<li><p>Willie Cauley-Stein - 6</p></li>

<p>Were they actively tanking all those years, probably not. But that&rsquo;s pretty terrible.</p>

<p>Cousins really wanted to go to the NJ Nets but they went with Derrick Favors who was seen as more upside and was later flipped to the Jazz for Deron Williams.</p>

<p>If the Nets went Cousins do the Kings take the upside of Favors and make that list look even worse or maybe get lucky with a higher pick.</p>

      <label for="lenx7rg" class="commentText"><p>I think they have made it more palatable for more teams to tank at once and a little less hard because being 4th worst is just as good as being the worst.</p>

<p>I think what has helped it some is the play-in. A lot more potential playoff revenue on the line for teams in the 9 or 10 seed than there was a few years ago and it&rsquo;s more embarrassing to tank out of that unless you start early.</p>

      <label for="leo3e18" class="commentText"><p>That ignores how draft picks work and the reality of the James Harden Draft. There’s hardly been any big moves in the lottery in the last 3 years. All the rockets got were some additional picks that were later in the draft. Give Detroit or the Wizards those picks and they waste them.</p>

<p>It’s about management and front office structure. The pistons have one of the worst nepotism in the NBA, they suck at development/scouting/ and recruitment and it leads to an organization that can’t find talent or loses it. The Pacers have done better than the Pistons despite NEVER having a number 1 overall pick, or even having a #1 play for them.  </p>

<p>Nah. It was done to teach all the kids how to win.</p>

<p>The salary floor was passed by a large margin to bring in as much of the best talent possible.</p>

<p>Made plays on 3 of the biggest names in FA (2 of whom were gotten and then relied on heavily), because ownership wanted to add as many wins as possible as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Sports that have 20 positions and 4 rounds can afford a fixed draft since the best rookie won&rsquo;t single handedly change a franchise.</p>

<p>Imagine the tanking we&rsquo;d see for the Wemby draft.</p>

<p>It would also have negative repercussions on good (not great) players trying to get paid and prove themselves since they&rsquo;d get load managed which would then let contenders pick them up for cheap, creating a wider talent gap.</p>

I feel like unlike the Pistons just completely missing on some of these, no one could&rsquo;ve foreseen Fultz&rsquo; shoulder issue after his great college season or Simmons just having a horrendous fall off whether it be mental issues or his back.</p>

<p>No one would&rsquo;ve passed on Simmons that year despite some of the red flags coming out of LSU.</p>

      <label for="lenafu4" class="commentText"><p>The only super dumb pick they’ve made in the rebuild was Killian. You could argue Barnes or Mobley over Cade but I’m not sold that they’d change our outlook considering the rest of the moves.</p>

<p>They just had a terribly built team last season. They had no shooting, no rim protection, no secondary playmaking. Cade had zero space to operate and the team was horribly built to capitalize on his strengths.</p>

I agree it was a quick turnaround, but for going completely scorched earth, to really only get 1 long term piece out of 3 years where you win 47 games total, and trading every single thing of value including 2 All Stars in Jrue Holiday and Andre Iguodala? It’s a pretty poor return. Especially with Embiid being plagued by injuries.</p>

      <label for="lenltp7" class="commentText"><p>Well the team was incredibly mediocre from 2005 to 2012, I don’t know if we count that as a tank job. And Iggy was traded for Bynum in order to make a playoff push, not as part of the process. The years we explicitly tanked were 2014, 2015, 2016, and part of 2017 after Embiid got hurt again. Saric and Simmons were both traded for All-Stars.</p>

<p>Like the roster was obviously not managed great but still it bettered the franchise overall. I don’t get that how that compares to teams like Detroit that hasn’t drafted an All-Star player in like 6 years. And I’d argue the Lakers and Knicks in the same stretch of the Process had worse results on paper, they tanked hard for 3-4 years too and the best players they got respectively were Ingram and Porzingis. They made betters move than us following that, but are we counting post-tank roster management as part of these “tank jobs”?</p>

<p>Then they tanked for three years. Then you get to the 2016 season when the league literally brought in Colangelo to end the process.</p>

      <label for="leo3jo6" class="commentText"><p>The only reason why the Process looks like that was because the league forced the Sixers to fire Hinkie and end the Process. Among the Process&rsquo; core tenets was that the draft was the best way to acquire talent, but that the draft was random and it was ideal to accumulate as many picks as possible rather than the highest possible picks to maximize the chances of getting star talent. Other tenets were that picks should always be made for best pick available rather than fit, and that young players that were to be traded should be traded for more picks and not for older star talent.</p>

<p>Colangelo was the one who made all the win-now or for-fit trades like ones for Butler, Tobi, and Ersan Ilyasova. Covington, Saric, Shamet, and Jerami Grant are the types of players you would want to surround Embiid/Simmons with, and the post-Hinkie Sixers traded them all away to prematurely go all-in.</p>

<p>Hinkie also never would have traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith since he believed in drafting for BPA rather than fit like Colangelo did. Colangelo also was the one who traded up for Fultz, giving up an extra first-rounder for virtually no reason, and dumped Richaun Holmes for free.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the Sixers would&rsquo;ve won a ring, but if they had stuck to the Process without making all-in/fit trades, they could&rsquo;ve had a roster that looked something like:</p>

<p>Starters: Simmons, Bridges, Grant, Covington, Embiid</p>

<p>Bench: Fultz, Shamet, Saric, Holmes</p>

<p>I would think that this roster could&rsquo;ve gone as far as the Sixers have gone over the last 7 or so years, and this isn&rsquo;t even accounting for the post-Colangelo picks like Maxey, Isaiah Joe, or Paul Reed.</p>

<p>2013 - pick 2 - Victor Oladipo</p>

<p>2014 - pick 4 - Aaron Gordon</p>

<p>2014 - pick 12 - Dario Saric -&amp;gt; traded for Elfrid Payton</p>

<p>2017 - pick 6 - Jonathan Isaac</p>

<p>2018 - pick 6 - Mo Bamba</p>

<p>So traded the two best picks, drafted two straight up busts and finally we are getting production from Jonathan Isaac.</p>

      <label for="lenm9n2" class="commentText"><p>The process doesn’t really get close to the worst, but I feel like we expected more. The tank itself got the top end talent with Embiid and Simmons. Simmons and Fultz fall off was not really predictable. But Embiid isn’t going to be in his prime for very much longer, honestly he might not even be in the NBA in five years, and they really don’t have much to show for it.</p>

      <label for="len999f" class="commentText"><p>Well to be fair, Detroit’s dumpster fire of a rebuild is not strictly about the position of the picks. There were good players available when they took Killian Hayes. That was like throwing a lottery pick in the toilet. Aside from Cade it remains to be seen whether or not they got great value with any of the other picks.</p>

<p>Troy Weaver also boned us with a bunch of terrible moves, so there was that. We traded two seconds for Marvin Bagley, then signed him for way too much money, then gave up two more seconds to trade him in the first year of the deal. That isn’t a franchise killing error, but when you apply that same ineptitude to everything you do as a franchise, you get a 14 win season and a 28 game losing streak. And, evidently, the fifth pick three years in a row.</p>

      <label for="lenbeqa" class="commentText"><p>Well 2020 was COVID year so I think there should be leniency with that whiff</p>

<p>2022 they would have to reach 7 picks to Jalen Williams in order to  pick someone who is an objectively, clearly better pick than Jaden Ivey. I don&rsquo;t think I remember any team who ever reached that far while in the lottery, so I&rsquo;ll spare blame on that pick too</p>

<p>2023 remains to be seen, the pistons took the highest upside player available, 2024 remains to be seen as well</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think any of these draft picks were truly awful like KANGS picking Papa Giannis and Willey Cauley stein in back to back drafts while holding an all nba center</p>

That every other pick didn’t pan out ultimately drags it down but not enough to make it not worth doing. Those igoudala teams were only slowly going to get worse way they were looking.</p>

 The thing that’s bad though is that while Simmons and fultz weren’t mvp caliber players, which is normal they weren’t even able to start by the end of their time their.</p>

      <label for="leo10mn" class="commentText"><p>How can you even ask that? It&rsquo;s the Sixers hands down. Of course there are different ways to judge &ldquo;worst results,&rdquo; and if you&rsquo;re going just by lottery balls then yeah other teams got lower picks. But if you&rsquo;re judging by how badly they fucked it up, it&rsquo;s gotta be the Sixers.</p>

<p>They tanked harder, longer, and more intentionally than any team ever. They were literally proud of their tank job. They gave it a nickname. They made it part of their core identity as a franchise. Their fans celebrated the fact that they were losers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna list all the ways they fucked up the rebuild because that would take hours and hopefully you already know a lot of it. Just a friendly reminder that they traded Mikal Bridges on draft night for a guy who&rsquo;s played a grand total of 13 games in the NBA.</p>

<p>The point is they bailed out of a good team with Jrue Holiday and other promising young players in order to be garbage for like five years, and a decade later they have nothing to show for it except a couple trips to the second round. Absolutely pathetic.</p>

<p>Except they never committed to it. They tried every year to get better. They never flipped assets like Bogdanovic because they needed him to compete, despite having one promising player (Cade) and nothing else.</p>

<p>The record for teams that actually tank and manage to sustain it is really good. It&rsquo;s when ownership pulls the plug that it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
