      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d7lj8j/where_does_steve_nash_rank_among_the_greatest/"><p>Where does Steve Nash rank among the greatest shooters ever?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Steve Nash gets a bad rep within NBA discourse since many people believe both of his MVPs should’ve been given to another guy (even though I think neither of those seasons were actually his best year), but because of that I feel like he gets lost in the shuffle when talking about the all time greats. Obviously when it comes to shooting, we know the normal suspects that get brought up in that conversation. Steph, Klay, Ray, Reggie, Larry, etc. I rarely hear about Steve Nash though, and that’s surprising to me, so I’ve compiled a little list of numbers here.</p>

<p>From 2001-2012 (Nash’s prime years):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Percentages of 49.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>43</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>90</sub>.8</p></li>

<li><p>10th in total made 3s</p></li>

<li><p>4th in 3pt%</p></li>

<li><p>Hit 40+% of his 3s in 10 of those years, and 14 of his 18 seasons</p></li>

<li><p>Rim FG% on par with Tony Parker, albeit on far fewer attempts</p></li>

<li><p>All time FT% record until Steph broke it</p></li>

<li><p>47.8% midrange shooter (on par with Dirk Nowitzki) on 4600 attempts, again far fewer</p></li>

<li><p>Most career 50-40-90 seasons with 4</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Nash was just crazy efficient and he didn’t have any sort of cold zones on the court, it just seems like his “fake” MVPs and possibly his inferior shot attempt numbers hold him back from this conversation specifically. So, thoughts? Where does he stand amongst the league’s GOAT shooters?</p>

If he got to catch-and-shoot as much as Ray/Reggie did, who knows what his efficiency would look like? He just happened to be one of the greatest playmakers of all time too</p>

      <label for="l70bk9m" class="commentText"><p>Just because he can handle the ball well doesn’t mean he can shoot well off the dribble.  They’re too entirely different skill sets.  Yes, I believe that Nash could create space, he did so in the key while being surrounded by defenders and managed to hit the roll man and occasionally score himself down there.  Don’t get me wrong, all point guards should be watching Steve Nash film, but people are making a lot of assumptions based on nothing.  He never showed he could hit 3’s off the dribble at a good clip.  Even today, when it’s a skill that is encouraged there are few enough who are good at it.  It’s not impossible he’d be great at it, but these assumptions are based on nothing, and there is some evidence to the contrary.</p>

      <label for="l7084gj" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Nash was ahead of his time. In a podcast I feel like he mentioned he would have shot even more 3 pointers knowing what he knows now. Some call Steph Curry’s game Nash 2.0 and Nash was a player development coach on staff for the Warriors for a couple of seasons.  Nash was so pass first that teams would try to force him to be a scorer and he didn’t solve that too well he admits. Wish he never broke his leg on Damian Lillard in a fluke preseason Lakers game. Really ruined his twilight of his career and messed with his back too.</p>

He was a top tier facilitator with a really solid cast in Phoenix so he didn&rsquo;t really have to shoot that much. If he was more of a primary scorer he would get the same recognition as bird, curry, etc..</p>

      <label for="l708qzi" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know I never felt Shaq really deserved that mvp over him. It was one of Shaq&rsquo;s worst seasons. And LeBron was 21 for the other runner up a year later. His 3rd year back in phoenix he was better than the 2 mvp seasons. He was the engine that made them sun&rsquo;s teams go. He was the most valuable player on some juggernaut regular season teams. He was irreplaceable. And they had some good playoff runs too just Dallas and San Antonio were better. But I never thought of him as a shooter when he played. He just Didn&rsquo;t miss the ones he took. He could have been scoring 23 or 24 ppg back then I think if he hunted his shot more. Nowadays he would probably be more like Trey young and avg high 20s . I never looked at his mvp&rsquo;s as not being legit. It was different than what you usually saw. I&rsquo;m Canadian so I&rsquo;m a little biased but. I thought it was good for the game. And that team wasn&rsquo;t working with any one else.</p>

When people think of great shooters, they think of volume, and Nash just wasn&rsquo;t a volume shooter. I think there&rsquo;s also an argument to be made that part of the reason he shot so well was because he was taking shots he was comfortable with, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really the case, I think he just was bigger into getting the offense moving. I do think he&rsquo;d dip down a bit, and might fall out of that conversation if he shot more, but who knows.</p>

<li><p>Steph - yes</p></li>

<li><p>Ray Allen - no way. He was a significantly worse shooter from a TS% perspective and limited to catch and shoot, never off the bounce. On top of that he had a number of choke jobs in the playoffs and was pretty un-clutch outside of one single shot. The fact that he did the 3 point contest 6 times and only won once looks embarrassing next to someone like Larry Bird who won <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> he was in.</p></li>

<li><p>Larry Bird - you could make this argument, especially relative to the competition and normal shooting percentages of the era.</p></li>

<li><p>Reggie Miller - Another measurably worse shooter with slightly more volume and extremely limited to catch and shoot. I have no idea what argument you&rsquo;d make for Reggie over Nash.</p></li>

<li><p>Klay - Again, the only thing he has on Nash is volume and being on better teams. Catch and release shooter who had a ton of open 3&rsquo;s due to Curry&rsquo;s gravity, and still shot worse than Nash.</p></li>

<li><p>Dirk - better player, worse shooter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I mean the way you&rsquo;re ranking volume over efficiency I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you actually argued that Carmelo was a better shooter than Nash.</p>

      <label for="l708iyf" class="commentText"><p>Hard to tell. At his peak, I&rsquo;d say he was in the top 5 at least. But nowadays, you have guys shooting great percentages with a shit ton more volume and points. So I think he&rsquo;ll slowly fall out of the top 10 soon.</p>

      <label for="l706otp" class="commentText"><p>I still think he robbed tf out of Lebron James for MVP. Freaking insane Lebron didn’t win with 31.4 points 7.0 rebounds 6.6 assists 1.6 steals and .8 blocks at 21! Also nuts when you look at Nash 2 MVP’s that CP3 didn’t win it with 21.1 points 4.0 rebounds 11.6 assists 2.7 steals .1 blocks 49% FG, 37% 3P, 85% FT, 17.8 WS, .284 win shares per 48 mins! Nash didn’t deserve either MVP but he was a SUPER underrated player and shooter</p>
