      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d7lj8j/where_does_steve_nash_rank_among_the_greatest/"><p>Where does Steve Nash rank among the greatest shooters ever?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Steve Nash gets a bad rep within NBA discourse since many people believe both of his MVPs should’ve been given to another guy (even though I think neither of those seasons were actually his best year), but because of that I feel like he gets lost in the shuffle when talking about the all time greats. Obviously when it comes to shooting, we know the normal suspects that get brought up in that conversation. Steph, Klay, Ray, Reggie, Larry, etc. I rarely hear about Steve Nash though, and that’s surprising to me, so I’ve compiled a little list of numbers here.</p>

<p>From 2001-2012 (Nash’s prime years):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Percentages of 49.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>43</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>90</sub>.8</p></li>

<li><p>10th in total made 3s</p></li>

<li><p>4th in 3pt%</p></li>

<li><p>Hit 40+% of his 3s in 10 of those years, and 14 of his 18 seasons</p></li>

<li><p>Rim FG% on par with Tony Parker, albeit on far fewer attempts</p></li>

<li><p>All time FT% record until Steph broke it</p></li>

<li><p>47.8% midrange shooter (on par with Dirk Nowitzki) on 4600 attempts, again far fewer</p></li>

<li><p>Most career 50-40-90 seasons with 4</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Nash was just crazy efficient and he didn’t have any sort of cold zones on the court, it just seems like his “fake” MVPs and possibly his inferior shot attempt numbers hold him back from this conversation specifically. So, thoughts? Where does he stand amongst the league’s GOAT shooters?</p>

      <label for="l70bk9m" class="commentText"><p>Just because he can handle the ball well doesn’t mean he can shoot well off the dribble.  They’re too entirely different skill sets.  Yes, I believe that Nash could create space, he did so in the key while being surrounded by defenders and managed to hit the roll man and occasionally score himself down there.  Don’t get me wrong, all point guards should be watching Steve Nash film, but people are making a lot of assumptions based on nothing.  He never showed he could hit 3’s off the dribble at a good clip.  Even today, when it’s a skill that is encouraged there are few enough who are good at it.  It’s not impossible he’d be great at it, but these assumptions are based on nothing, and there is some evidence to the contrary.  Shooters who are good at this include Steph, who has the fastest release of all time, Dame, whose first two steps are lightning quick, and a bunch of guys who are way taller and stronger with a higher release.  Nash created space with his body in the key, which is great if you’re waiting to hit the right cutter or get a floater/finger roll if they sag to stop the pass.  It’s not really a way to get a 3 point shot off.  And I don’t know where you get that Steve Nash was breaking ankles, that wasn’t really his thing.  He was just super dependable with the ball and constantly made the correct decision with it.  He wasn’t really flooring dudes with a killer crossover.</p>

You said you don’t get to 42% career from 3 without being able to create your own space and shoot off the dribble.  Steve Kerr shot 45.4% over his career from 3 on nearly exclusively catch and shoot.  Even Reggie Miller shot over 80% of his 3’s on catch and shoot.  It is how the NBA used to work.  There were fewer snipers, it was emphasized less, and for the people who could really knock em down it was still viewed as a niche talent that needed to be set up by coming off screens and getting them the easiest possible shot.  Steve Nash was drafted into an NBA that still had this mindset.</p>

      <label for="l70fdet" class="commentText"><p>Directly out of their ass. 43% of his 3s were assisted during his prime years on the Suns and they&rsquo;re acting like he was Klay lmao. So what is the idea here? He was just left wide open to shoot off the dribble as he held the ball? Pure nonsense. The stats literally don&rsquo;t add up even if you never watched him play.</p>

      <label for="l70fbyy" class="commentText"><p>Nash was not as heliocentric as players like Harden, Luka and Trae are today.  He didn’t run every single play.  Sometimes iso Joe, JRich, Barbosa, Amare, Boris, even young Dragic etc would cook.  When he was on the Mavs he was standing around a lot when Dirk or Mike Finley iso’d.  There just wasn’t the kick out to shooters gravity we have today.</p>

<p>If they got stuck and kicked it out to him, he’d knock them down at a great clip.  But the dude averaged 3.2 3’s a game for his career and they were almost none of them off the dribble.</p>

Their offenses weren’t even geared towards getting 3’s.  3’s were taken when wide open or if they didn’t have enough time on the shot clock to shoot from closer.</p>

He didn’t have a jump shot release 10 feet in the air, he didn’t have a lightning quick stepback.  He didn’t have the quick release of Steph.  You’re assuming he can just get 3 point shots and not looking at the logistics of how he did it or how he would go about increasing volume.

Some call Steph Curry’s game Nash 2.0 and Nash was a player development coach on staff for the Warriors for a couple of seasons.  Nash was so pass first that teams would try to force him to be a scorer and he didn’t solve that too well he admits. Wish he never broke his leg on Damian Lillard in a fluke preseason Lakers game. Really ruined his twilight of his career and messed with his back too.</p>

He was on a great team for one and for 2 they had a huge early advantage of being the first small ball 5 out style offense and it was stupid fast paced. Nash was awesome he just wasn’t the most valuable player in the league or the best player for the year he won. His raw stats and advanced stats weren’t great either. He had the 50/40/90 split on low volume in a super wide open offense and somehow parlayed that into 2 MVP’s</p>

Seems pretty valuable to me. Then in 06, Amar&rsquo;e missed the entire season and because of Nash, Phoenix still won 54 games and had the 2nd best offense in the league.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fine if you think someone else deserved those MVPs more, but the narrative that Nash didn&rsquo;t deserve them or that he just wasn&rsquo;t as valuable is just plain stupid. That team started and stopped with Nash.</p>

<p>He only missed 10 games in those 2 years, and without him they went 2-8 and their offense was one of the worst in the league. Almost exactly like how they were before Nash arrived there</p>

And LeBron was 21 for the other runner up a year later. His 3rd year back in phoenix he was better than the 2 mvp seasons. He was the engine that made them sun&rsquo;s teams go. He was the most valuable player on some juggernaut regular season teams. He was irreplaceable. And they had some good playoff runs too just Dallas and San Antonio were better. But I never thought of him as a shooter when he played. He just Didn&rsquo;t miss the ones he took. He could have been scoring 23 or 24 ppg back then I think if he hunted his shot more. Nowadays he would probably be more like Trey young and avg high 20s . I never looked at his mvp&rsquo;s as not being legit. It was different than what you usually saw. I&rsquo;m Canadian so I&rsquo;m a little biased but. I thought it was good for the game. And that team wasn&rsquo;t working with any one else.</p>

      <label for="l70bqe0" class="commentText"><p>Its tough because he was such an efficient shooter, but he didn&rsquo;t score. When people think of great shooters, they think of volume, and Nash just wasn&rsquo;t a volume shooter. I think there&rsquo;s also an argument to be made that part of the reason he shot so well was because he was taking shots he was comfortable with, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really the case, I think he just was bigger into getting the offense moving. I do think he&rsquo;d dip down a bit, and might fall out of that conversation if he shot more, but who knows.</p>

<li><p>Steph - yes</p></li>

<li><p>Ray Allen - no way. He was a significantly worse shooter from a TS% perspective and limited to catch and shoot, never off the bounce. On top of that he had a number of choke jobs in the playoffs and was pretty un-clutch outside of one single shot. The fact that he did the 3 point contest 6 times and only won once looks embarrassing next to someone like Larry Bird who won <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> he was in.</p></li>

<li><p>Larry Bird - you could make this argument, especially relative to the competition and normal shooting percentages of the era.</p></li>

<li><p>Reggie Miller - Another measurably worse shooter with slightly more volume and extremely limited to catch and shoot. I have no idea what argument you&rsquo;d make for Reggie over Nash.</p></li>

<li><p>Klay - Again, the only thing he has on Nash is volume and being on better teams. Catch and release shooter who had a ton of open 3&rsquo;s due to Curry&rsquo;s gravity, and still shot worse than Nash.</p></li>

<li><p>Dirk - better player, worse shooter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I mean the way you&rsquo;re ranking volume over efficiency I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you actually argued that Carmelo was a better shooter than Nash.</p>
