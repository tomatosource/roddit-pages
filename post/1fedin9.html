      <label for="lmmvc7m" class="commentText"><p>Completely agree.</p>

<p>Celtics won in 2008 and I was 19. It was incredible. KG/PP/RA were larger than life superheroes. It was such a cool moment.</p>

<p>This latest championship came when I was 35. It was a lot of fun but mostly just that: fun. A bunch of rich 25 year olds won a basketball game. I still got bills to pay.</p>

<p>As you get older your perspective on sports changes. And that’s healthy. Guys who are 25+ who live and die by their teams need to reassess their priorities.</p>

It&rsquo;s the best sport in the world but the NBA does it&rsquo;s best to ruin it. They put out such a terrible product, it&rsquo;s borderline unwatchable with all the breaks and commercials.</p>

<p>Following the league as a whole? Absolutely. I&rsquo;d never want to go back to the 2010&rsquo;s with superteam after superteam and the regular season being foregone conclusions. We are in a golden age of parity and there has never been this many teams fighting for the chip. The talent is at an all time high as well, every team has a star or 2.</p>

<p>The issue is if they allowed that in the regular season consistently. Like 5 players would be fit at the end of the year. The league is more intense and physical than it has ever been on both sides of the ball in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lmmt0v5" class="commentText"><p>Yes, it has, but foul baiting and flopping is certainly still a thing. There is not enough consequences.</p>

<p>One issue is that the NBPA regulates how high fines can be and they are so pathetic. The NBA as a whole is too forgiving in who they give a fine to, but even when they do, it&rsquo;s such a small % of their salaries that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>I want defenders to be able to play defense again. Offense has way too much leeway when it comes to how fouls are called. The fouling at end of games needs to be looked at as well. I don&rsquo;t really have a solution, but games drag on way too long if it&rsquo;s close.</p>

      <label for="lmmvhfm" class="commentText"><p>Yea you&rsquo;re probably right. They didn&rsquo;t have a picture-in-picture though in the middle of the game where Charles and Kenny is telling us about the spread if Donovan Mitchell scores over or under 50 points this game. It sticks out so much in my memory cause that was the first time I saw them pitch some shitty gambling website in the middle of the game. It was a bit shocking how far they had fallen, especially seeing the Inside the NBA crew do it while the game was live.</p>

<p>As for the amount of commercials, I feel like it&rsquo;s gotten a  bit worse since I became a fan in the 2000&rsquo;s. For example: We never get to see player intros in the playoffs anymore. There is so much hype surrounding that and legendary moments.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8gXugd4z4k" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8gXugd4z4k</a></p>

<p>2013 Heat</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcyYl-Bk60A" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcyYl-Bk60A</a></p>

<p>2005 Pistons</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn6kiimEsYc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn6kiimEsYc</a></p>

<p>97 Bulls</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t get that at all anymore. Now it&rsquo;s just quick shouting match from ESPN straight into tipoff.</p>

      <label for="lmmud6y" class="commentText"><p>Basketball is the only sport where I don&rsquo;t want it to be close at the end because the game just drags. A 3 point lead turns, what should be a close exciting game, into a free throw shooting contest with constant interruptions from timeouts.</p>

<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t even get into the reviews which can take several minutes and still get the call wrong. Though it is nice they&rsquo;ve fixed it for next year where the refs can call a foul while reviewing plays.</p>

<p>The game itself is for the most part better than ever with more skill and strategy than ever before. But the actual product the NBA produces is getting worse.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Better strategy often makes games worse. It&rsquo;s why min-maxing in videogames is boring, and why everyone being a stealth archer in Oblivion/Skyrim is boring.</p>

<p>Basketball-wise, fouling when you&rsquo;re up 3 with 5 seconds left is smart strategy. Viewer-wise, I wanna see the offensive team make or miss that 3 because it&rsquo;s more fun than watching FTs.</p>

<p>Pretty much every bad thing about the modern NBA can be boiled down to smarter strategy, at the cost of fun/entertainment. Foul-baiting is smart, flopping is smart, load management is smart, calling a bunch of timeouts at the end of the game is smart, and every team playing the same style of volume-chucking 3s is smart. They&rsquo;re all smart strategies, and ways to min-max basketball.</p>

The NBA knows that most people only focus on a game when time is almost up and it&rsquo;s still close, so there&rsquo;s no better time to force feed the ads and promotions.</p>

      <label for="lmmhxk5" class="commentText"><p>personally 04-15 was peak basketball. the focus on the 3 ball has made the game less interesting from a strategic and personnel standpoint. it was cool watching role players like JR Smith or Mo Peterson light people up from time to time. nowadays all role players do are shoot 3s. one positive is that there are more all star calibre players, who are all very skilled, and parity is back.</p>

      <label for="lmml552" class="commentText"><p>I tend to agree. For the first year or two of what came to be known as Moreyball, it was exciting to see such high scoring affairs, with players lighting up box score sheets and obliterating single-season records left and right. But now that we&rsquo;re a decade into it, the style has gotten stale. It seems the sport has gained a lot of efficiency at the expense of its artistry.</p>

      <label for="lmmoeqn" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with this, but I think it&rsquo;s worth saying that NBA schemes are <em>really</em> sophisticated right now, and the fast rotations, pre-help, and switchability that Thibs/Spoelstra/Kerr teams&rsquo; defenses pioneered is now kinda the norm, which is incredible and really cool in its own way.</p>

<p>That said I think the 3 is just too efficient for what it is, and offenses in general have had things skew their way really hard. Average of 35 3 point attempts a game from each team last year and there&rsquo;s some offensive ratings in the 120s. Like the game isn&rsquo;t simpler, it&rsquo;s not players&rsquo; faults or players being too one dimensional/playing too much like AAU stars(which is an issue that I think the game has gotten a lot better on), it&rsquo;s that the current skills in the current environment of the rules has made the game more solved. It definitely didn&rsquo;t feel that way in 2008 or 2011. The game had their own issues at the time, but I think this is very distinct and kinda extreme.</p>

<p>I think they really cleaned it up this past year. They allowed way more contact, especially in the playoffs. Going forward they need to maintain this. The spacing, sets, and skills are super fun to watch right now.</p>

      <label for="lmmhnom" class="commentText"><p>The talent is off the charts better. 5th and 6th guys today would be role players in the early 2000&rsquo;s. The agility / athleticism and shot making is way more fun / impressive.</p>

<p>The grit / competitiveness is nowhere near the same as back in the day so it&rsquo;s harder to be as devoted to players or teams when they don&rsquo;t seem to care as much.</p>

<p>The shot selections can be awesome or tedious. Seeing a bunch of missed threes sucks. I also miss the post-up game.</p>

      <label for="lmmicko" class="commentText"><p>For me, there&rsquo;s two parts. Watching a game live, and the &ldquo;fun factor&rdquo; of keeping up with teams / players / drama.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&rsquo;t gamble, I don&rsquo;t love how much it&rsquo;s started to impact watching the sport. Whether that&rsquo;s just perceptions or impacting gameplay is obviously up for debate, but I anticipate the vibes only getting worse over the next few seasons. But between that and the insane frequency and length of ad breaks, I definitely did enjoy the watching games more in the past.</p>

<p>But as far as enjoying the game, being able to engage and talk shit with other people live, getting to see highlights from games the next day (whenever you want!!), and&hellip; talking more shit afterwards, it&rsquo;s SO much more fun now.</p>

<p>My favorite player is still AI, which is when I got really into watching, but in the Jordan era basketball was just ubiquitous.</p>

      <label for="lmmuy5r" class="commentText"><p>No, I think the NBA has sold their soul to maximize as much profit as possible, which is also something that&rsquo;s happening everywhere else in society. That being said, it should be the best ever but right now it&rsquo;s not. I think it kind of Peaks about 2016. There is a few good moments since then but I feel like there is never-ending moments that were incredible between the 80s until 2016. Last year&rsquo;s Dallas Mavs teams were fun to watch but I&rsquo;m also a fan of theirs, but I haven&rsquo;t seen nearly as many all-time great moments lately. I guess the block in the 2021 finals? Everything else seems like a blur. Even though Denver was dominant and amazing, I can&rsquo;t think of a single moment from their playoff run. Boston was an all-time team this past year but I can&rsquo;t really think of too many moments and it hasn&rsquo;t even been that long. 2022 warriors? Maybe a couple of Staff shots and a Gary Payton between the legs pass or something like that and that&rsquo;s about it</p>

Tatum is clear example of it. While he’s a good player, the way he plays the game and the way he is portrayed in the media is just so blah. Like I couldn’t care less about them winning a chip.</p>

<p>I feel like in the past we always had a hero and a villain archetype to root and cheer against and that’s like complete gone now.</p>

<p>The big difference between this era and say 10 or 20 years ago is the parity and how many teams are actually competing for the title, not sure if it&rsquo;s better for ratings to have 2 teams that are true competitors or 4-8 like we have now but that&rsquo;s the main difference imo.</p>

      <label for="lmn68ku" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching since the early 80s.</p>

<p>And while the Lakers Celtics rivalry for that period remains unmatched in my mind, I can&rsquo;t say that overall the &lsquo;fun factor&rsquo; was that high.  Though in fairness, it was impossible for most people to watch more than a game or two a week unless you lived in a market, and then you basically only got that markets games.</p>

<p>I absolutely hated the 90s and the way the Pistons and Knicks played, by far the least fun era for me.  Though much schandenfreude in the Knicks inevitable failures I guess.</p>

<p>The 2000s were fun because of the Spurs Lakers rivalry (and the Suns were just a fun team).</p>

<p>The 2010s were a blur for some reason, nothing really stands out, other than the obvious Warriors/Cavs stuff at the end, but I don&rsquo;t think I enjoyed watching the game that much, even though I did enjoy the Warriors style.</p>

<p>The 2020s are off to a great start though.  So many great players spread on a bunch of different teams.  So many older players still capable of playing great ball, so many young players trying to make that leap.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably mostly just recency bias for me though, but I do think that this current era is the most fun to watch.</p>

      <label for="lmmggef" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think it’s as simple as that, the nba has highs and lows in terms of fun level and they aren’t linear</p>

<p>For example, as a theoretical unbiased viewer the nba was probably really fun in 2008-2012, prime Kobe lakers vs heatles vs big 3 Celtics vs spurs vs up and coming teams like kd thunder, ton of star power and really competitive basketball</p>

<p>And then again, 2015-2016 was one of the best stretches ever with the 73 win warriors and all the parity and storylines from that time</p>

<p>But you follow that with the kd warriors which wasn’t fun at all for someone who just wants parity, and then shortly after that the pandemic, we definitely had a rough stretch</p>

<p>I think it’s coming back around though, the young guys behind lebron Steph and kd are entering their prime so we are finally entering into a new era of stars and the league has a ton of parity, been a new champ every year since the warriors, I think it’s gonna be a great next few years</p>

Late 90&rsquo;s early 00&rsquo;s were my favourite, loved the Webber/Divac/Williams Kings and Don Nelson Dallas teams, they were a joy to watch.</p>

<p>I grew up watching European basketball, so I prefer offense with a lot of motion, iso feels boring. I feel like NBA is finally getting a modern game it deserves, offense is more structured with less 1-on-1 and iso and more team motion to create space. I don&rsquo;t mind the positionless aspect, big guys who can&rsquo;t shoot or pass have no place on the court anyways.</p>

You get to see the skill of players 1-5 the openness and space of the court which this applies to all teams. You had teams that were fun to watch as they were outliers like the Showtime Lakers, 7 seconds or less, Bird Celtics, 80s Nuggets, Suns, Run TMC Warriors, 90s Sonics. Now even though the bad teams are in the league they style of play they have can be exciting, its not good but exciting. Compared to the slow pace, walk the ball up the court, 5 seconds left running the offense, by throwing it down to a big man that wasnt elite bad teams.</p>

      <label for="lmn5677" class="commentText"><p>I remember watching basketball as a kid on a 1980’s 21” television. Basketball has gotten more fun for me to watch as TV’s have gotten bigger with better definition. I’ve been to a lot of games and sat in the nosebleeds and courtside a couple times. Basketball is a game that is a much better experienced up close and personal. Poster dunks from 10 angles in 4k where you can see the sweat flying off bodies, the insane above the rim play we see in today’s game in 4k slowed down and close up…I find myself watching more basketball and appreciating the experience more today. The production value of the broadcast can be a bit off putting when I see how it’s all about ridiculous money these days but it’s still more fun to watch now than in the past.</p>

<p>As far as eras go…I’m a Kings fan and they’ve been shit for a long time. But boy was basketball fun late 90’s early 00’s when my team was good. My team being good was more fun to me than any era of greats like Jordan or Magic vs. Bird or Shaw and Kobe.</p>

The mid 2000&rsquo;s, especially 2005 Spurs vs Pistons where the Spurs won and only one game had a team go past 100 was excruciating to watch. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like good defense but those games were not fun as a whole.</p>

<p>So, most fun? No. Comparable to other times that were fun? Yes.  Watching Jordan dominate was fun basketball overall, even if though her kept winning and I didn&rsquo;t like it.  Watching Steph change the game with his shooting is comparable.</p>

<p>My 2¢.</p>

      <label for="lmn8yj4" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching since I was a kid in 2002, and I think it was more fun when I was growing up than it is now. I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of games that used to end with slugfests that ended with teams scoring 60 to 70 points as the final score, but once they opened it up around 2005, I really enjoyed it. From 2005 until around 2013 or so was the sweet spot. Still tough defense, but not a ton of threes, and teams had a variety of playstyles. The Warriors and Rockets ushering in the three point evolution where teams chuck 50 to 60 threes a game, instead of say 30, really made it kind of boring in comparison. Plus post play is missing in today&rsquo;s era. I still love the NBA, but it&rsquo;s definitely more of a chore to watch than it was 15 years ago.</p>

      <label for="lmmg11k" class="commentText"><p>I started in the early 2000s as a Sixers fan but didn&rsquo;t get to see as much as Iverson as I wish I could. Before LeBron left Cleveland, I feel like it was really fun rooting for him and seeing him dominate while growing. But imo the league has more visible stars, and the speed and spacing of those Warriors teams facing Durant and Westbrook on the Thunder, Harden leading the Rockets, and Bron finally reaching the ultra elite level was all amazing to me</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching since the 80&rsquo;s and the most fun was 2012-2014 because I&rsquo;m a spurs fan and the ball movement oriented, deep team with crafty vets was thrilling to watch.</p>

Would say at this point in time the league is in a good place with the depth of talent league wide, and more parity than usual. Though I think the era a lot of people here (based on age, style preferences, etc) will prefer is the mid to late 2010&rsquo;s as it had elements of previous eras while also seeing some teams start emphasizing more of the pace and space style we currently see.</p>

Its easy to idolize people back then (early 2000s). Almost each of us then had our idols and we pattern our game to them. Nowadays, theres a lot more hating, legacy points. Comparing eras bs.</p>

<p>As for watching the games, id go to the early 2000s where reaching 100 pts is an epic night, someone reaching 40pts is also a hot topic the next day, and a triple double is as rare as a shiny mewtwo. And oh, when a 3 pointer is such a celebration.</p>

<p>Finally. When all star games are not for the soft and spoiled millionares.</p>

<p>The problem is, this isn&rsquo;t soccer. The NBA has always been about star power. The 2010s had Kobe, Lebron, Steph, KD, Harden, Kawhi, Melo, Dwight, CP3, etc.</p>

<p>I feel like the stars of today just don&rsquo;t have that same status, partly because everyone else around them is better so they don&rsquo;t shine as brightly. And when I see the media try hard to try and appoint new superstars like Anthony Edwards, it comes across as cringe to me. Lebron Kobe and Steph never needed to be anointed by the media, they took their crowns by dominating</p>

      <label for="lmmo1kt" class="commentText"><p>I started watching basketball in the late 2000s in middle school (Im 27) The best era for the league in general IMO was 2012-2015. The balance between defense and offense in todays nba is awful. Guy have inflated averages and games have way to many possessions. I went back and watched some 2000s and early 2010s basketball and every point felt like it meant way more. People say it was nothing but iso but I disagree most of the playoff match ups I watched had great basketball they just needed to shoot less long twos.</p>

<p>For my team specifically its honestly 2016 until now. People clown on the &ldquo;late playoff struggles of the celtics&rdquo; or whatever but dont realize how fun it is watching your team go deep in the playoffs almost every year and basically have linear improvement until they finally win one.</p>

<p>Basketball is beautiful every era of the nba is fun in its own way</p>

<p>For a long time it was literally just Lebron and/or Steph in the finals, and we all knew that was going to happen before the season even started lol</p>

      <label for="lmmp0ot" class="commentText"><p>No - historically speaking I actually think the game is in a rather &ldquo;not fun&rdquo; spot at the moment.</p>

<p>The extreme prevalence of the 3-point shot often makes games dull, the flopping and foul baiting is out of control, instant replay and endless commercials really drag games out, the cost to attend a game in person has reached an absurd point, defense has been neutered, and the ads are getting relentless with the on court and other in game advertising.  And don&rsquo;t get me going on the gambling angle being shoved into our faces endlessly.  Lastly, the whole social media era has really turned much of the fan discourse into something awful.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame too because the league has way more talent than ever, but the league keeps pushing and pushing the product to squeeze more nickels out at the cost of fan experience.</p>

<p>The 80&rsquo;s were the most exciting and fun era - the feuds, the physical play, the high octane pace and scoring without the 3-point shot, the emergence of the sport in general and players becoming celebrities&hellip;</p>

<p>League was in a pretty good place through the mid-90&rsquo;s.  95-05-ish were some rough years.  Then I thought the decade from 05-ish to 15-ish was great - at first the 3-point emergence was a breath of fresh air, scoring got back to a decent level, talent level was really increasing.  But since then, the NBA game has turned into a bit of a caricature of the sport.  Silver is showing no signs of slowing anything down, so I fear for what is coming in the next few years.</p>

Stable franchises incrementally improving to try to catch up to the current kings of the mountain. Detroit ramping up to beat the Celtics. Chicago learning how to beat Detroit. Distinct team styles built up over years. Strong looming threats like the Knicks, Pacers, Jazz. The Rockets two year breakthrough. Strong long term booking as a pro wrestling fan might call it. It all felt higher stakes and rivalries were more personal and well founded.  </p>

<li><p>Efficiency leaps/understanding has made most teams offense pretty much identical. Watching a million 3pt shooting contests each season might be efficient, but it just creates homogeneity.</p></li>

<li><p>Foul baiting/weak whistle. The second half of last season was better, but the rule changes that have knee capped in recent decades have made the game… less impressive. Defense is fun. Watching the greatest athletes in the world compete is fantastic. Watching layup lines and free throw contests… not so much.</p></li>

      <label for="lmmpu10" class="commentText"><p>I think the noise around the game takes away from it. I LOVED how Dame described the 2010 finals. He said that the last time it felt like two teams were going at it and the whole world was just watching it rather than feeling like they were involved in the game and had a say. I wish I could find the clip to describe it better, but essentially it felt like everyone was watching that series to enjoy it and just watch rather than looking for something else to drag it out.</p>

<p>Obviously there has always been media and narratives, but I think with Social Media, it has really taken away from the purity of the game. If someone has a bad game, it is a mark on their legacy. If someone has a good game, it takes away from everyone else in the league/history. Sadly I think it does come from an access to information, you can&rsquo;t really be a diehard fan if someone else can dissect every objective reason why your team/players aren&rsquo;t as good or won&rsquo;t be good.</p>

Ads on ads on ads, frequent timeouts to show more ads, a million different jersey and court combinations. Everything is a constant reminder on how over-capitalistic it’s become. It does affect how much I look forward to games now.</p>

<p>Basketball-wise, talent is at an all time high. Pace and space is far more entertaining than watching grindfests any day, but I do think it should be dialed back some. 105-110 PPG for the average team is ideal imo. Average team was like 115 PPG last year which is crazy.</p>

<p>Also, I get how it can be viewed as exciting that a 15 point lead is no longer safe with 6 minutes left in the fourth quarter, but it’s also annoying at how common coming back from a 15-20 point deficit is in today’s game.</p>

<p>Give me late 2000s-2010s basketball for sure when Durant was on OKC and the Spurs were good.</p>

      <label for="lmmsdpz" class="commentText"><p>I grew up loving basketball. I was obsessed for close to 20 years, maybe a bit longer. There was a solid like 10-year stretch where I watched (literally) every playoff game outside of some of the first-round matchups where some games were on at the same time as other games (like Raptors/Magic in 08 comes to mind).</p>

<p>But that really changed with the Moneyball aspect  that changed the league, along with Steph. I LOVE watching Steph, but I hate what he did to the league in that everybody is trying to be him and teams are just threes and dunks (just look at the shot distributions nowadays compared to 15 years ago, it’s all threes or around the rim). I love watching Steph, not poor imitations of Steph.</p>

<p>I understand WHY the game changed, but that doesn’t mean that it is an entertaining product for me to watch. Since Durant went to the Warriors, my interest in the NBA has dropped precipitously. I still watch, but not nearly to the extent that I used to. Giannis helped kind of get me into it again and now Ant, as they have kind of an old school vibe to them. I enjoy watching LBJ and Curry play still.</p>

<p>For me, I loved growing up in the 90s and 2000s where there was the golden era for centers and two guards. My favorite position is the two, so growing up with Kobe, Wade, VC, TMac, etc was awesome.</p>

<p>I miss the variety in play and tough defense.</p>

<p>But that also has a lot to do with Kobe Bryant as that was at his absolute best.</p>

<p>The other individual seasons I’ve enjoyed to a lesser extent were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2011</p></li>

<li><p>2013</p></li>

<li><p>2015</p></li>

<li><p>2016</p></li>

<li><p>2018</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The game has changed a lot where more 3 pointers are being launched and it makes for less variety in terms of entertainment.</p>

<p>The mid 2000s to mid 2010s were perfect for myself because you had the bigs down low in the post passing out to the guards and overall the points distribution felt better.</p>

<p>There was a good period from late 2000&rsquo;s to mid 2010&rsquo;s where defense, offense, and 3pt shooting were balanced. That&rsquo;d be my rational choice.</p>

<p>People (Charles barkley mostly :D) told me Michael Jordan era blah blah blah, I didn&rsquo;t even watch a single game from him how do you expect me to believe you? Nah.

I&rsquo;d say no, it&rsquo;s not as fun as it was in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s, however it is the most fun it has been since then. It is probably part nostalgia for me for my youth and bygone eras. But I feel in the 2000&rsquo;s it really kind of hit a low point in terms of watch ability for a while. But the last decade has really been a huge improvement. I really enjoy the NBA right now. I say this as a Hawks fan who has legit only had a couple of great moments in my lifetime so it has little to do with how my team is doing. I just love watching pro basketball.</p>

      <label for="lmmu21r" class="commentText"><p>I feel its a lot worse now. Touch fouls have always been a problem but they seem to be worse now. Spread out offences and 3 point volume make games look like playground games. There are always teams that are fun to watch, that run half court offence and not just spread pick an roll.</p>

<p>But games seem longer, with less defense and it seems like every game is a cointoss on who is making more 3s.</p>

<p>I also hate how any emotional response is a tech.</p>

It was pre AAU revolution so a lot of these guys had tougher backgrounds so they played harder. Less foul baiting, less 3 point shooting, and not to mention, the dawn of the ‘03 draft class during the dominance of Kobe/shaq/duncan/garnett/dirk/etc era.</p>

      <label for="lmmuhgy" class="commentText"><p>The “fun” period for the NBA was between 2007 and 2014.</p>

<p>The NBA’s reputation recovered from the immediate after-Jordan years and (according to critics) being too “hip hop” with guys like Iverson, Steve Francis, and T-Mac playing AND1 isoball. This was the period where we got teams with 2-3 stars per club like the Celtics, Lakers, Nuggets, Magic, and Cavs in the first half of the period, and then Bulls, Spurs, Heat, Clippers, Thunder, and Grizzlies in the second half. This was the time NBA 2K was at its peak and elevated from standard basketball video game to the same echelon of pop-culture relevance like Madden and FIFA.</p>

<p>It began with the KG-Allen-Pierce Celtics and ended with the Spurs of 2014 playing ‘total basketball.’ And then the Splash Bros. Warriors and them whoring the three-point line came along to seal the NBA’s fate.</p>

I have some friends who swear that the 80s and 90s were peak ball times. Me personally I think I agree with the general consensus that early 2000s 2010s were good. Right now I find the game so damn slow and waaaaaaaay too many whistles.</p>

I used to be more excited to watch random teams play throughout the week, but big games get me more excited I guess.

<p>I’m not a fan of today’s game. The no calls on traveling, flops and most games have about 75-100 three point shot attempts.</p>

<p>I enjoyed slashers to the hoop with the ball and those going to the hoops and somebody feeding it to them as they’re cutting to the hoop. Every generation has dudes with killer hops that dunk. I watched Dominique, Worthy, Dr. J, Orlando Woolridge, Darryl Dawkins, Darrell Griffith , etc. fly through the air.</p>

<p>Not sure if there has been a rivalry as contentious and talented as the 80’s Celtics/Lakers and even the Celtics/76ers.</p>

<p>The Lakers had a HOF GM, coach, Magic, Worthy, Kareem and Cooper. The Celts had HOF credentials in ownership, GM, Bird, McHale, Parrish, and Dennis Johnson.</p>

<p>That’s a crap-ton of talent and supporting talent butting heads.</p>

      <label for="lmmutcj" class="commentText"><p>I’ve been watching since the late 80s and there were terrible years after Jordan leaving the Bulls that wasn’t great basketball just because the game was so slow with low scoring. Outside of that, there were always  great players and great storylines that made NBA fun to watch. I think the superteam era is overblown. No superteam has ever really lived up to the hype. Miami with Lebron should have won 4 rings and Warriors with KD also should have at least 4 rings. Hell Lakers with Malone and Payton should have at least beaten Detroit.</p>

<p>If anything, it makes the league more interesting to watch. I will say the biggest drop has been the Allstar game. People use to get so amped for that. It was like a mini-Super Bowl.</p>

I think the NBA is always fun when you&rsquo;re watching great teams square off, especially in the playoffs, regardless of era. The NBA was supposedly at a low point in the late 70s but I remember watching all of those Seattle-Washington Finals games and loving it.</p>

<p>But when you&rsquo;re watching shitty teams, in any era, it&rsquo;s a chore. A Pistons-Wizards game is something you would have to pay me to watch. That&rsquo;s different than football, where even bad teams can be somewhat interesting.</p>

<p>Lebron carried the crappy Cavs rosters year after year through the Eastern Conference. Watching him play pre-2010 was mesmerizing. I never saw such a heavy guy move so fluidly (6’9’’, 260+).</p>

      <label for="lmmx71k" class="commentText"><p>It..depends. There&rsquo;s some things I really like about today&rsquo;s game and things I like of the past.</p>

<p>I liked games being more grit and grind and scores being in the 80s and 90s. Teams routinely scoring 115+ kinda makes the thrill of these offensive showings less interesting. </p>

<p>At the same time the high scoring is a result of the talent of players increasing throughout the years. Role players having that &ldquo;once in a while great game&rdquo; is much more common. Furthermore, 20 point leads are no longer a sign of certain victory so now games become more interesting when teams try and make a late run. There&rsquo;s pros and cons to both.</p>

      <label for="lmmxvp2" class="commentText"><p>Starting watching in 2011 when I was 10, and imo 2011-2016 was the best era. Part of me thinks it&rsquo;s cause I was just younger and just discovering the wonders of sports.</p>

<p>At the same time I do also think the game was just better. Positions actually meant something, teams wouldn&rsquo;t shoot 3s on every possession. Playoff atmosphere was better also. Fans would actually wear the playoff shirts in the crowd and teams actually had structure in terms of what jersey they&rsquo;re wearing. Prime LeBron and the heat were great villains, rise of the Warriors, lob city, Spurs were still cooking, OKC was electric. I also started watching football around then and I enjoy it more today, so I don&rsquo;t think me being young is the only reason I prefer it</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m singling out a specific season from a non rooting interest perspective, it&rsquo;s probably 93-94.  The 94 Playoffs were phenomenal.</p>

      <label for="lmmy7er" class="commentText"><p>I cite the 2013-2016 period as my personal favorite. (For whatever that is worth, I was older than 18-22.)</p>

<p>I thought it perfectly blended the ball-movement shot-making of today, but, unlike now, it also had defence, mid-rangers, and post-play.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Nuggets fan, but the 2014 Spurs are my favourite Non-Denver basketball team of all time, and they came a year after one of the best Finals of all time. Then, 2015 was the rise of the Warriors, which was amazing until 2017. LeBron was also at the peak of his powers during this period, and Kobe/Duncan were still decent (until the final year).</p>

<p>Those OKC Thunder teams were really fun; Harden came out of nowhere; Steph emerged as an all-timer; and you had more randomly weird characters like Birdman, JR Smith and Stephen Jackson.</p>

<p>During those years, the NBA was easily my favorite sport, and I thought I would be an NBA superfan for life. Unfortunately, these past few years have been pretty boring (except my Nuggets!!!), and I have drifted toward College Football, the NFL and even MLB.</p>

      <label for="lmmy9z0" class="commentText"><p>Way too much stuff that’s not actually basketball is ruining the nba watching experience. I don’t like watching so many ad breaks, they have tv timeouts, 6 team time outs, quarter breaks, halftime is all ads pretty much especially for ESPN, official review breaks, sometimes they lay over ads to the game if the ads run over time. And it’s the same ads over and over again. What is the point of secaucus if they can’t just tell the refs immediately if shit is out of bounds or a foul or a goal tend, why have the headphones on and discuss for like 10 minutes. Sooo much talk about sports gambling, can’t imagine being a kid and watching and learning about over and under and the line. Too many fouls on defenders that shouldn’t be called and too many carries/travels (yes I know about the steps start from when you gather the ball) that gives the offensive too much advantage. How can a defender possibly have a chance if the offensive player’s hesitation dribble is a carry half the time and these players now have the ability to really shoot from anywhere. Give my defensive boys a chance damn. Too much emphasis on young players development, yes they need development but veterans are important and I don’t like watching a bottom tier team just throwing out 5 below 22 year olds getting crushed by 30 year olds vets because they don’t know how to play nba basketball.</p>

<p>With that being said, nba has never been as accessible as it is now, and you can hyper follow anything about anyone. I don’t know if that’s more enjoyable but it’s an improvement.</p>

The 2000-2010 stretch was great, MJ still around, Lakers, Spurs, Kings, Kobe, Lebron, KG, Shaq, Duncan. I love the 10s with Miami as the evil empire and the CLE v GS battles but honestly the last 4-6 years may have been my favorite. There are issues with the game, foul batting, flopping, traveling, review process, etc. but the league is so much fun across the board. I can watch so many different trans and be entertained where back 10 and more years ago, the would be 4 or 5 teams that would be entertaining (plus the Bucks, good bad or ugly, Im invested).</p>

<p>I would say from late 2000&rsquo;s to late 2010&rsquo;s was the best era, imo.</p>

<p>We had amazing teams formed like Big 3 Celtics and Heat, eventually Cavs. Western Conference was stacked with teams like Spurs, Mavs, Lakers, Thunder, Rockets.</p>

<p>You had to be a GREAT team to win a title in those years.</p>

The game allowed a nice level of physicality on both sides of the ball. The level of physicality meant it wasn&rsquo;t easy to score like it is today, but it wasn&rsquo;t impossible to score like it was in the 90s.</p>
