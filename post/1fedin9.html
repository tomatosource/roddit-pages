<p>That happened to coincide with an era where scoring 100 points was a great offensive night and likely to get you a win. That made for very easy watching.</p>

      <label for="lmmvc7m" class="commentText"><p>Completely agree.</p>

<p>Celtics won in 2008 and I was 19. It was incredible. KG/PP/RA were larger than life superheroes. It was such a cool moment.</p>

<p>This latest championship came when I was 35. It was a lot of fun but mostly just that: fun. A bunch of rich 25 year olds won a basketball game. I still got bills to pay.</p>

<p>As you get older your perspective on sports changes. And that’s healthy. Guys who are 25+ who live and die by their teams need to reassess their priorities.</p>

It&rsquo;s the best sport in the world but the NBA does it&rsquo;s best to ruin it. They put out such a terrible product, it&rsquo;s borderline unwatchable with all the breaks and commercials.</p>

<p>Following the league as a whole? Absolutely. I&rsquo;d never want to go back to the 2010&rsquo;s with superteam after superteam and the regular season being foregone conclusions. We are in a golden age of parity and there has never been this many teams fighting for the chip. The talent is at an all time high as well, every team has a star or 2.</p>

<p>The issue is if they allowed that in the regular season consistently. Like 5 players would be fit at the end of the year. The league is more intense and physical than it has ever been on both sides of the ball in the playoffs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to the owners, the NBA and the NBPA together with the ref org to actually follow the rulebook they themselves have written. It&rsquo;s very unprofessional that the book says one thing and then they do something completely different.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing when they come out and say they&rsquo;re going to do something, like fine flopping, every single year and then drop it after 3-4 weeks. Why? People welcome these changes. It&rsquo;s unprofessional and it&rsquo;s not on the refs, they get undeserved criticism. It&rsquo;s on the league as a whole.</p>

      <label for="lmoafn2" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. What makes it unwatchable are all the small things too like players complaining about the refs on EVERY call, the lack or inability to play tough defense, the surplus of timeouts, the catering to the physically weak players like Trae Young, the flopping like Embiid, Harden. Can you imagine if you played like these people do in pickup ball? You&rsquo;d be laughed at or worse.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you try to bring in more casual viewers when its absolutely unwatchable and that&rsquo;s coming from someone who&rsquo;s followed the NBA since 2001.</p>

      <label for="lmmt0v5" class="commentText"><p>Yes, it has, but foul baiting and flopping is certainly still a thing. There is not enough consequences.</p>

<p>One issue is that the NBPA regulates how high fines can be and they are so pathetic. The NBA as a whole is too forgiving in who they give a fine to, but even when they do, it&rsquo;s such a small % of their salaries that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>I want defenders to be able to play defense again. Offense has way too much leeway when it comes to how fouls are called. The fouling at end of games needs to be looked at as well. I don&rsquo;t really have a solution, but games drag on way too long if it&rsquo;s close.</p>

      <label for="lmmvhfm" class="commentText"><p>Yea you&rsquo;re probably right. They didn&rsquo;t have a picture-in-picture though in the middle of the game where Charles and Kenny is telling us about the spread if Donovan Mitchell scores over or under 50 points this game. It sticks out so much in my memory cause that was the first time I saw them pitch some shitty gambling website in the middle of the game. It was a bit shocking how far they had fallen, especially seeing the Inside the NBA crew do it while the game was live.</p>

<p>As for the amount of commercials, I feel like it&rsquo;s gotten a  bit worse since I became a fan in the 2000&rsquo;s. For example: We never get to see player intros in the playoffs anymore. There is so much hype surrounding that and legendary moments.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8gXugd4z4k" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8gXugd4z4k</a></p>

I get league pass at the start of every year because I am so hyped the league is back, and I never renew it for the 2nd month because watching non-Playoff games is a terrible experience. There&rsquo;s simply no reason to watch a full game with the 10 minute full game highlight vids on Youtube being posted within an hour or the game ending.</p>

<p>Following the league is awesome, though. Probably my main hobby. The amount of great teams makes it a thrill, even with Boston, GS or LAL winning it all still happening often. It has been so cool to see the Nuggets, Buck and Raptors win it all. Hope we&rsquo;re not entering in to a Boston 3-peat era or an OKC dynasty or something like that.</p>

A 3 point lead turns, what should be a close exciting game, into a free throw shooting contest with constant interruptions from timeouts.</p>

<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t even get into the reviews which can take several minutes and still get the call wrong. Though it is nice they&rsquo;ve fixed it for next year where the refs can call a foul while reviewing plays.</p>

<p>Better strategy often makes games worse. It&rsquo;s why min-maxing in videogames is boring, and why everyone being a stealth archer in Oblivion/Skyrim is boring.</p>

<p>Basketball-wise, fouling when you&rsquo;re up 3 with 5 seconds left is smart strategy. Viewer-wise, I wanna see the offensive team make or miss that 3 because it&rsquo;s more fun than watching FTs.</p>

<p>Pretty much every bad thing about the modern NBA can be boiled down to smarter strategy, at the cost of fun/entertainment. Foul-baiting is smart, flopping is smart, load management is smart, calling a bunch of timeouts at the end of the game is smart, and every team playing the same style of volume-chucking 3s is smart. They&rsquo;re all smart strategies, and ways to min-max basketball.</p>

      <label for="lmo3bmx" class="commentText"><p>I’ll be honest. I think that the NBA figuring out the value of the 3pt shot has made the game less exciting. I feel like the value of good shooter should be in their ability get the same 2 points as other players but from further away.</p>

<p>The problem with the 3pt line is that the extra point is so valuable that even average shooters best serve in their offenses as floor spreaders, despite the fact that they aren’t even good shooters. So you have these guys taking long range shots, despite not being great shooters, and it’s still a good shot because of the extra point.</p>

<p>If you take away the 3pt line, now the guy that can hit the corner shot at 35% is a liability and the defense can mostly ignore them. And I think this would be a good thing, it would raise the skill necessary to be an effective offensive player.</p>

Can’t fight over a screen because the ball handler can just stop and jump sideways into a jump shot and get 3 free throws. Couldn’t defend a drive because unless you were a fucking statue in the lane 2 steps before the guy gets there or it’s a block.</p>

<p>Guys like Dame REALLY benefited from the way offenses were allowed to clear space without consequence. The league basically mandated a clean shot every possession</p>

Maybe I was just heavy into football in that stretch with how the patriots were, after 09 big 3 broke up and pivoted to hockey as a secondary.</p>

      <label for="lmo3whb" class="commentText"><p>For sure. 90s basketball was great for several reasons. Stars didn’t jump teams as much so each team had a stronger identity and style. Rivalries were fun back then. </p>

<p>Also the level of exposure was in a sweet spot where you could watch highlights on ESPN, but there weren’t a million social media channels and podcasts filled with hot takes, armchair analytics, and pointless arguments between former and current players about who’s better.</p>

      <label for="lmmhxk5" class="commentText"><p>personally 04-15 was peak basketball. the focus on the 3 ball has made the game less interesting from a strategic and personnel standpoint. it was cool watching role players like JR Smith or Mo Peterson light people up from time to time. nowadays all role players do are shoot 3s. one positive is that there are more all star calibre players, who are all very skilled, and parity is back.</p>

      <label for="lmml552" class="commentText"><p>I tend to agree. For the first year or two of what came to be known as Moreyball, it was exciting to see such high scoring affairs, with players lighting up box score sheets and obliterating single-season records left and right. But now that we&rsquo;re a decade into it, the style has gotten stale. It seems the sport has gained a lot of efficiency at the expense of its artistry.</p>

      <label for="lmmoeqn" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with this, but I think it&rsquo;s worth saying that NBA schemes are <em>really</em> sophisticated right now, and the fast rotations, pre-help, and switchability that Thibs/Spoelstra/Kerr teams&rsquo; defenses pioneered is now kinda the norm, which is incredible and really cool in its own way.</p>

<p>That said I think the 3 is just too efficient for what it is, and offenses in general have had things skew their way really hard. Average of 35 3 point attempts a game from each team last year and there&rsquo;s some offensive ratings in the 120s. Like the game isn&rsquo;t simpler, it&rsquo;s not players&rsquo; faults or players being too one dimensional/playing too much like AAU stars(which is an issue that I think the game has gotten a lot better on), it&rsquo;s that the current skills in the current environment of the rules has made the game more solved. It definitely didn&rsquo;t feel that way in 2008 or 2011. The game had their own issues at the time, but I think this is very distinct and kinda extreme.</p>

<p>Anyways, I only came back because of Wemby and it was a good decision, basketball is exciting again</p>

<p>The grit / competitiveness is nowhere near the same as back in the day so it&rsquo;s harder to be as devoted to players or teams when they don&rsquo;t seem to care as much.</p>

<p>The shot selections can be awesome or tedious. Seeing a bunch of missed threes sucks. I also miss the post-up game.</p>

I kind of knew at the time that we were spoiled and may never witness another period where so many all time greats are at their peaks at the same exact time. Not long from now, we&rsquo;ll look back and realize that our latest Olympic run was the literal end of an era. The last piece of hardware for 3 of the top 15 players of all time.</p>

<p>While the players you mentioned will likely give us another 2-3 years of solid play, I&rsquo;d be genuinely surprised if any of those guys get another chip before retiring.</p>

      <label for="lmmicko" class="commentText"><p>For me, there&rsquo;s two parts. Watching a game live, and the &ldquo;fun factor&rdquo; of keeping up with teams / players / drama.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&rsquo;t gamble, I don&rsquo;t love how much it&rsquo;s started to impact watching the sport. Whether that&rsquo;s just perceptions or impacting gameplay is obviously up for debate, but I anticipate the vibes only getting worse over the next few seasons. But between that and the insane frequency and length of ad breaks, I definitely did enjoy the watching games more in the past.</p>

<p>But as far as enjoying the game, being able to engage and talk shit with other people live, getting to see highlights from games the next day (whenever you want!!), and&hellip; talking more shit afterwards, it&rsquo;s SO much more fun now.</p>

<p>My favorite player is still AI, which is when I got really into watching, but in the Jordan era basketball was just ubiquitous.</p>

      <label for="lmnict0" class="commentText"><p>I definitely agree while people are arguing about which era is better I’m loving the evolution of the game and love watching how the new players every decade feed off what the last decade taught them.  Euro’s, side steps, three point bombs from the logo.  It’s such beautiful progression.</p>

      <label for="lmmo9z0" class="commentText"><p>I enjoyed the years from about 06-13. At that time being a 20 + ppg scorer meant you were legit &amp; teams didn’t score 115 points every night. It seems like stats are inflated now and it’s too easy to score in the regular season. I think that time period had the right balance of scoring and tough defense.</p>

      <label for="lmn68ku" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching since the early 80s.</p>

<p>And while the Lakers Celtics rivalry for that period remains unmatched in my mind, I can&rsquo;t say that overall the &lsquo;fun factor&rsquo; was that high.  Though in fairness, it was impossible for most people to watch more than a game or two a week unless you lived in a market, and then you basically only got that markets games.</p>

<p>I absolutely hated the 90s and the way the Pistons and Knicks played, by far the least fun era for me.  Though much schandenfreude in the Knicks inevitable failures I guess.</p>

<p>The 2000s were fun because of the Spurs Lakers rivalry (and the Suns were just a fun team).</p>

<p>The 2010s were a blur for some reason, nothing really stands out, other than the obvious Warriors/Cavs stuff at the end, but I don&rsquo;t think I enjoyed watching the game that much, even though I did enjoy the Warriors style.</p>

<p>The 2020s are off to a great start though.  So many great players spread on a bunch of different teams.  So many older players still capable of playing great ball, so many young players trying to make that leap.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably mostly just recency bias for me though, but I do think that this current era is the most fun to watch.</p>

      <label for="lmmuy5r" class="commentText"><p>No, I think the NBA has sold their soul to maximize as much profit as possible, which is also something that&rsquo;s happening everywhere else in society. That being said, it should be the best ever but right now it&rsquo;s not. I think it kind of Peaks about 2016. There is a few good moments since then but I feel like there is never-ending moments that were incredible between the 80s until 2016. Last year&rsquo;s Dallas Mavs teams were fun to watch but I&rsquo;m also a fan of theirs, but I haven&rsquo;t seen nearly as many all-time great moments lately. I guess the block in the 2021 finals? Everything else seems like a blur. Even though Denver was dominant and amazing, I can&rsquo;t think of a single moment from their playoff run. Boston was an all-time team this past year but I can&rsquo;t really think of too many moments and it hasn&rsquo;t even been that long. 2022 warriors? Maybe a couple of Staff shots and a Gary Payton between the legs pass or something like that and that&rsquo;s about it</p>

      <label for="lmmw3kp" class="commentText"><p>This is how I feel too. The players and teams these days except for a handful of players are just so boring. Both on and off the court. Tatum is clear example of it. While he’s a good player, the way he plays the game and the way he is portrayed in the media is just so blah. Like I couldn’t care less about them winning a chip.</p>

<p>I feel like in the past we always had a hero and a villain archetype to root and cheer against and that’s like complete gone now.</p>

      <label for="lmmhm39" class="commentText"><p>Started in late 80&rsquo;s. 90&rsquo;s were rough times, slow pace and lack of shooting to stretch the defense made for some snoozefests. Late 90&rsquo;s early 00&rsquo;s were my favourite, loved the Webber/Divac/Williams Kings and Don Nelson Dallas teams, they were a joy to watch.</p>

<p>I grew up watching European basketball, so I prefer offense with a lot of motion, iso feels boring. I feel like NBA is finally getting a modern game it deserves, offense is more structured with less 1-on-1 and iso and more team motion to create space. I don&rsquo;t mind the positionless aspect, big guys who can&rsquo;t shoot or pass have no place on the court anyways.</p>

<p>The big difference between this era and say 10 or 20 years ago is the parity and how many teams are actually competing for the title, not sure if it&rsquo;s better for ratings to have 2 teams that are true competitors or 4-8 like we have now but that&rsquo;s the main difference imo.</p>

      <label for="lmmk6sb" class="commentText"><p>Have watched it since the 80s, this is the most fun basketball to watch. You get to see the skill of players 1-5 the openness and space of the court which this applies to all teams. You had teams that were fun to watch as they were outliers like the Showtime Lakers, 7 seconds or less, Bird Celtics, 80s Nuggets, Suns, Run TMC Warriors, 90s Sonics. Now even though the bad teams are in the league they style of play they have can be exciting, its not good but exciting. Compared to the slow pace, walk the ball up the court, 5 seconds left running the offense, by throwing it down to a big man that wasnt elite bad teams.</p>

      <label for="lmo11nw" class="commentText"><p>Started watching around ‘94 but started really grasping it on a deeper level during ‘96-98 (9-10 years old).</p>

<p>90s were great because I was just enthralled by the league but when you go back and watch games they don’t compare to todays games in terms of athleticism. Like, the swings in todays game can so fun to watch, and when a player gets on a roll. Also the pace of a team like Indiana is just so much goddamn fun to watch.</p>

<p>What I hate about today? When neither teams are moving the ball and just shooting 3s. It’s painful to watch. I hate when teams default to that. The 90s had some serious wars of attrition that could be fun to watch.</p>

<p>My least favorite time was like post-Laker Shaq until early prime LeBron (2004-2008/09ish). After prime LeBron the league has (imo) continued to get better— you had prime Bron start into Miami LeBron era followed by spreading the court with Steph and the rise of the 3-pt game. Now this era of international players and positionless basketball.</p>

<p>I understand having frustrations about today’s game, i listed mine, but LORD ALMIGHTY, this is the best the game’s ever been.</p>

      <label for="lmmggef" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think it’s as simple as that, the nba has highs and lows in terms of fun level and they aren’t linear</p>

<p>For example, as a theoretical unbiased viewer the nba was probably really fun in 2008-2012, prime Kobe lakers vs heatles vs big 3 Celtics vs spurs vs up and coming teams like kd thunder, ton of star power and really competitive basketball</p>

<p>And then again, 2015-2016 was one of the best stretches ever with the 73 win warriors and all the parity and storylines from that time</p>

<p>But you follow that with the kd warriors which wasn’t fun at all for someone who just wants parity, and then shortly after that the pandemic, we definitely had a rough stretch</p>

<p>I think it’s coming back around though, the young guys behind lebron Steph and kd are entering their prime so we are finally entering into a new era of stars and the league has a ton of parity, been a new champ every year since the warriors, I think it’s gonna be a great next few years</p>

      <label for="lmn5677" class="commentText"><p>I remember watching basketball as a kid on a 1980’s 21” television. Basketball has gotten more fun for me to watch as TV’s have gotten bigger with better definition. I’ve been to a lot of games and sat in the nosebleeds and courtside a couple times. Basketball is a game that is a much better experienced up close and personal. Poster dunks from 10 angles in 4k where you can see the sweat flying off bodies, the insane above the rim play we see in today’s game in 4k slowed down and close up…I find myself watching more basketball and appreciating the experience more today. The production value of the broadcast can be a bit off putting when I see how it’s all about ridiculous money these days but it’s still more fun to watch now than in the past.</p>

<p>As far as eras go…I’m a Kings fan and they’ve been shit for a long time. But boy was basketball fun late 90’s early 00’s when my team was good. My team being good was more fun to me than any era of greats like Jordan or Magic vs. Bird or Shaw and Kobe.</p>

The mid 2000&rsquo;s, especially 2005 Spurs vs Pistons where the Spurs won and only one game had a team go past 100 was excruciating to watch. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like good defense but those games were not fun as a whole.</p>

<p>So, most fun? No. Comparable to other times that were fun? Yes.  Watching Jordan dominate was fun basketball overall, even if though her kept winning and I didn&rsquo;t like it.  Watching Steph change the game with his shooting is comparable.</p>

<p>My 2¢.</p>

There have been 2 really great periods in my viewing life, 1986-1998 and 2007-2019, because there was a good balance between offense and defense. 1998-2005 was a tough watch because they played too slow, and they let the defenses get away with too much. Today the pace is good, but defenses are hamstrung to the point that scoring is cheap. I appreciate the skill of the players, but it is less compelling to watch.</p>

      <label for="lmo2gu9" class="commentText"><p>It’s weird, I think the NBA is more fun to follow now, but worse to watch as an actual product. The parity makes it fun to follow, but watching actual games is kind of boring to me now. Defense has been neutered and the flopping is as bad as soccer at this point.</p>

<p>On the flipside, the games were more fun to watch in the 10s even if you pretty much knew the one or two teams who were going to the Finals in each conference 99% of the time. The game still looked a lot like the basketball I grew up with in the 90s and 00s, but the super teams got old after a few years. Modern basketball is just fundamentally different to the basketball I watched and played before, so maybe I’m just an old head but I don’t really like watching the game as it’s  played now.</p>

      <label for="lmo5a8y" class="commentText"><p>Basketball wise, I probably say the years around 2015 was the most fun. Especially 2016. Could be bias as I&rsquo;m a Warriors fan but a lot of things went on that year.</p>

<p>I watched basketball in the 80s and 90s but the games were slow. I enjoyed the fights and the fouls especially whenever the Heat/Knicks/Pacers played. I also found the illegal D rules to be the dumbest thing ever. So glad they moved away from that</p>

<p>However for the drama of the NBA, there&rsquo;s no time like today.  I swear I watch basketball strictly for the drama and not the actual playing.</p>

      <label for="lmo6b4v" class="commentText"><p>I started watching in the 07-08 season.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite seasons were:</p>

<p>2010-11: The heat hate was fascinating to observe, also a ton of parity still. Celtics, Heat, Magic, Bulls, Mavs, Spurs, Thunder, Lakers were all title contenders.</p>

<p>2014-15 &amp; 2015-16: a lot of parity at this time. The west had many strong contenders. The emergence of GSW was really compelling. The 2016 finals was amazing.</p>

<p>2017-18: as a Rockets fan, very fun season</p>

<p>2019-20: The NBA landscape had shifted significantly, AD to LAL, PG and Kawhi to LAC, Westbrook to HOU, Butler to MIA</p>

<p>2023-24: I’m a Timberwolves fan, so finally having a fun season was utter ecstasy.</p>

<p>Worst season:</p>

<p>2016-17: Lack of parity made it boring and a foregone conclusion</p>

      <label for="lmp5b7e" class="commentText"><p>It is not the most fun to watch right now, but a lot of that is due to the fact that as a kid and teenager, I cared way more about Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, and Tracy Mcgrady than I could ever care about a professional athlete now at 32 years old.</p>

<p>However, I do believe there was something a bit more enjoyable when it was about a player just trying really fuckin hard to be better than the person in front of them, rather than what is always the exact technically and mathematically correct thing to do.
When T-Mac and Kobe would take contested long two fadeaways over 3 people, that shit obviously wasn’t the best shot to take but holy shit was it fun to watch.</p>

<p>I think that’s why Steph is the most watched player of the last 10 years, because he does that wild nonsense AND it’s the analytically correct shot so he gets away with it.</p>

<p>I think the more the game has been filtered by algorithms and analytics, the less magical it has become.</p>

<p>The reason sports are fun, and humans started playing them, is because of raw human feeling and instincts.</p>

Before LeBron left Cleveland, I feel like it was really fun rooting for him and seeing him dominate while growing. But imo the league has more visible stars, and the speed and spacing of those Warriors teams facing Durant and Westbrook on the Thunder, Harden leading the Rockets, and Bron finally reaching the ultra elite level was all amazing to me</p>

Would say at this point in time the league is in a good place with the depth of talent league wide, and more parity than usual. Though I think the era a lot of people here (based on age, style preferences, etc) will prefer is the mid to late 2010&rsquo;s as it had elements of previous eras while also seeing some teams start emphasizing more of the pace and space style we currently see.</p>

Its easy to idolize people back then (early 2000s). Almost each of us then had our idols and we pattern our game to them. Nowadays, theres a lot more hating, legacy points. Comparing eras bs.</p>

<p>As for watching the games, id go to the early 2000s where reaching 100 pts is an epic night, someone reaching 40pts is also a hot topic the next day, and a triple double is as rare as a shiny mewtwo. And oh, when a 3 pointer is such a celebration.</p>

<p>Finally. When all star games are not for the soft and spoiled millionares.</p>

<p>The problem is, this isn&rsquo;t soccer. The NBA has always been about star power. The 2010s had Kobe, Lebron, Steph, KD, Harden, Kawhi, Melo, Dwight, CP3, etc.</p>

<p>I feel like the stars of today just don&rsquo;t have that same status, partly because everyone else around them is better so they don&rsquo;t shine as brightly. And when I see the media try hard to try and appoint new superstars like Anthony Edwards, it comes across as cringe to me. Lebron Kobe and Steph never needed to be anointed by the media, they took their crowns by dominating</p>

      <label for="lmmo1kt" class="commentText"><p>I started watching basketball in the late 2000s in middle school (Im 27) The best era for the league in general IMO was 2012-2015. The balance between defense and offense in todays nba is awful. Guy have inflated averages and games have way to many possessions. I went back and watched some 2000s and early 2010s basketball and every point felt like it meant way more. People say it was nothing but iso but I disagree most of the playoff match ups I watched had great basketball they just needed to shoot less long twos.</p>

<p>For my team specifically its honestly 2016 until now. People clown on the &ldquo;late playoff struggles of the celtics&rdquo; or whatever but dont realize how fun it is watching your team go deep in the playoffs almost every year and basically have linear improvement until they finally win one.</p>

<p>Basketball is beautiful every era of the nba is fun in its own way</p>

      <label for="lmmody3" class="commentText"><p>Honestly was fun as a Laker fan and since I was naturally fixated on the Western conference I got to see really good, competitive games. What wasn&rsquo;t fun was already knowing who&rsquo;d be in the finals year after year. 2019 was one of the best. Covid was covid and I kind of lost interest a bit.</p>

<p>For a long time it was literally just Lebron and/or Steph in the finals, and we all knew that was going to happen before the season even started lol</p>

      <label for="lmmp0ot" class="commentText"><p>No - historically speaking I actually think the game is in a rather &ldquo;not fun&rdquo; spot at the moment.</p>

<p>The extreme prevalence of the 3-point shot often makes games dull, the flopping and foul baiting is out of control, instant replay and endless commercials really drag games out, the cost to attend a game in person has reached an absurd point, defense has been neutered, and the ads are getting relentless with the on court and other in game advertising.  And don&rsquo;t get me going on the gambling angle being shoved into our faces endlessly.  Lastly, the whole social media era has really turned much of the fan discourse into something awful.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame too because the league has way more talent than ever, but the league keeps pushing and pushing the product to squeeze more nickels out at the cost of fan experience.</p>

<p>The 80&rsquo;s were the most exciting and fun era - the feuds, the physical play, the high octane pace and scoring without the 3-point shot, the emergence of the sport in general and players becoming celebrities&hellip;</p>

<p>League was in a pretty good place through the mid-90&rsquo;s.  95-05-ish were some rough years.  Then I thought the decade from 05-ish to 15-ish was great - at first the 3-point emergence was a breath of fresh air, scoring got back to a decent level, talent level was really increasing.  But since then, the NBA game has turned into a bit of a caricature of the sport.  Silver is showing no signs of slowing anything down, so I fear for what is coming in the next few years.</p>

      <label for="lmmp9xd" class="commentText"><p>As an old I’d have to say the most fun was Magic/Bird to the end of the Jordan era. Stable franchises incrementally improving to try to catch up to the current kings of the mountain. Detroit ramping up to beat the Celtics. Chicago learning how to beat Detroit. Distinct team styles built up over years. Strong looming threats like the Knicks, Pacers, Jazz. The Rockets two year breakthrough. Strong long term booking as a pro wrestling fan might call it. It all felt higher stakes and rivalries were more personal and well founded.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Efficiency leaps/understanding has made most teams offense pretty much identical. Watching a million 3pt shooting contests each season might be efficient, but it just creates homogeneity.</p></li>

<li><p>Foul baiting/weak whistle. The second half of last season was better, but the rule changes that have knee capped in recent decades have made the game… less impressive. Defense is fun. Watching the greatest athletes in the world compete is fantastic. Watching layup lines and free throw contests… not so much.</p></li>

      <label for="lmmpu10" class="commentText"><p>I think the noise around the game takes away from it. I LOVED how Dame described the 2010 finals. He said that the last time it felt like two teams were going at it and the whole world was just watching it rather than feeling like they were involved in the game and had a say. I wish I could find the clip to describe it better, but essentially it felt like everyone was watching that series to enjoy it and just watch rather than looking for something else to drag it out.</p>

<p>Obviously there has always been media and narratives, but I think with Social Media, it has really taken away from the purity of the game. If someone has a bad game, it is a mark on their legacy. If someone has a good game, it takes away from everyone else in the league/history. Sadly I think it does come from an access to information, you can&rsquo;t really be a diehard fan if someone else can dissect every objective reason why your team/players aren&rsquo;t as good or won&rsquo;t be good.</p>

Ads on ads on ads, frequent timeouts to show more ads, a million different jersey and court combinations. Everything is a constant reminder on how over-capitalistic it’s become. It does affect how much I look forward to games now.</p>

<p>Basketball-wise, talent is at an all time high. Pace and space is far more entertaining than watching grindfests any day, but I do think it should be dialed back some. 105-110 PPG for the average team is ideal imo. Average team was like 115 PPG last year which is crazy.</p>

      <label for="lmmq65i" class="commentText"><p>This era is worse to watch overall. Coaches used to draw up plays and have actual offenses. It just feels that it’s a 3 point contest now and the only offense is a pick and roll done over and over again.</p>

<p>Also, I get how it can be viewed as exciting that a 15 point lead is no longer safe with 6 minutes left in the fourth quarter, but it’s also annoying at how common coming back from a 15-20 point deficit is in today’s game.</p>

<p>Give me late 2000s-2010s basketball for sure when Durant was on OKC and the Spurs were good.</p>

      <label for="lmmsdpz" class="commentText"><p>I grew up loving basketball. I was obsessed for close to 20 years, maybe a bit longer. There was a solid like 10-year stretch where I watched (literally) every playoff game outside of some of the first-round matchups where some games were on at the same time as other games (like Raptors/Magic in 08 comes to mind).</p>

<p>But that really changed with the Moneyball aspect  that changed the league, along with Steph. I LOVE watching Steph, but I hate what he did to the league in that everybody is trying to be him and teams are just threes and dunks (just look at the shot distributions nowadays compared to 15 years ago, it’s all threes or around the rim). I love watching Steph, not poor imitations of Steph.</p>

<p>I understand WHY the game changed, but that doesn’t mean that it is an entertaining product for me to watch. Since Durant went to the Warriors, my interest in the NBA has dropped precipitously. I still watch, but not nearly to the extent that I used to. Giannis helped kind of get me into it again and now Ant, as they have kind of an old school vibe to them. I enjoy watching LBJ and Curry play still.</p>

<p>For me, I loved growing up in the 90s and 2000s where there was the golden era for centers and two guards. My favorite position is the two, so growing up with Kobe, Wade, VC, TMac, etc was awesome.</p>

<p>I miss the variety in play and tough defense.</p>

      <label for="lmmsfi9" class="commentText"><p>I started in late 05 and obviously this may be bias but the most that I’ve enjoyed was from 06-10.</p>

<p>But that also has a lot to do with Kobe Bryant as that was at his absolute best.</p>

<p>The other individual seasons I’ve enjoyed to a lesser extent were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2011</p></li>

<li><p>2013</p></li>

<li><p>2015</p></li>

<li><p>2016</p></li>

<li><p>2018</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The game has changed a lot where more 3 pointers are being launched and it makes for less variety in terms of entertainment.</p>

<p>The mid 2000s to mid 2010s were perfect for myself because you had the bigs down low in the post passing out to the guards and overall the points distribution felt better.</p>

<p>There was a good period from late 2000&rsquo;s to mid 2010&rsquo;s where defense, offense, and 3pt shooting were balanced. That&rsquo;d be my rational choice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say which era you started watching heavily influences what you find fun.</p>

<p>People (Charles barkley mostly :D) told me Michael Jordan era blah blah blah, I didn&rsquo;t even watch a single game from him how do you expect me to believe you? Nah. Same thing for Barkley really, only lasted when he was playing. You won&rsquo;t be able to register modern basketball as well as when you were young.</p>

      <label for="lmmta8s" class="commentText"><p>90s was the best. Game moved faster. More physical. No flopping. Stars played every night and played through difficulty. And regular season was competitive and watchable. Today’s game outside the playoffs is very hit or miss.</p>

      <label for="lmmtv2x" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching since around 1981. I&rsquo;d say no, it&rsquo;s not as fun as it was in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s, however it is the most fun it has been since then. It is probably part nostalgia for me for my youth and bygone eras. But I feel in the 2000&rsquo;s it really kind of hit a low point in terms of watch ability for a while. But the last decade has really been a huge improvement. I really enjoy the NBA right now. I say this as a Hawks fan who has legit only had a couple of great moments in my lifetime so it has little to do with how my team is doing. I just love watching pro basketball.</p>

      <label for="lmmu21r" class="commentText"><p>I feel its a lot worse now. Touch fouls have always been a problem but they seem to be worse now. Spread out offences and 3 point volume make games look like playground games. There are always teams that are fun to watch, that run half court offence and not just spread pick an roll.</p>

<p>But games seem longer, with less defense and it seems like every game is a cointoss on who is making more 3s.</p>

<p>I also hate how any emotional response is a tech.</p>

That being said I was in university from 2009-2013, nba was much more fun, as were my other favourite sports, to follow and watch when I was in my late teens and early 20’s.</p>

<p>Doesn’t have the same magic these days, still enjoy watching.</p>

It was pre AAU revolution so a lot of these guys had tougher backgrounds so they played harder. Less foul baiting, less 3 point shooting, and not to mention, the dawn of the ‘03 draft class during the dominance of Kobe/shaq/duncan/garnett/dirk/etc era.</p>

<p>My god it was beautiful.</p>

      <label for="lmmuhgy" class="commentText"><p>The “fun” period for the NBA was between 2007 and 2014.</p>

<p>The NBA’s reputation recovered from the immediate after-Jordan years and (according to critics) being too “hip hop” with guys like Iverson, Steve Francis, and T-Mac playing AND1 isoball. This was the period where we got teams with 2-3 stars per club like the Celtics, Lakers, Nuggets, Magic, and Cavs in the first half of the period, and then Bulls, Spurs, Heat, Clippers, Thunder, and Grizzlies in the second half. This was the time NBA 2K was at its peak and elevated from standard basketball video game to the same echelon of pop-culture relevance like Madden and FIFA.</p>

<p>It began with the KG-Allen-Pierce Celtics and ended with the Spurs of 2014 playing ‘total basketball.’ And then the Splash Bros. Warriors and them whoring the three-point line came along to seal the NBA’s fate.</p>

I have some friends who swear that the 80s and 90s were peak ball times. Me personally I think I agree with the general consensus that early 2000s 2010s were good. Right now I find the game so damn slow and waaaaaaaay too many whistles.</p>

      <label for="lmmuldy" class="commentText"><p>It seems more chaotic and less thoughtful now, but its probably the opposite. I used to be more excited to watch random teams play throughout the week, but big games get me more excited I guess. Like I could watch a Nets Trailblazers game from 1997, but would rather watch a warriors Cavs game in the finals. Right now though its not quite the most fun.</p>

      <label for="lmmuscf" class="commentText"><p>The first game I watched through its entirety was Magic/Bird in the NCAA championship. Then grew up in SoCal watching the Showtime Lakers.</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of today’s game. The no calls on traveling, flops and most games have about 75-100 three point shot attempts.</p>

<p>I enjoyed slashers to the hoop with the ball and those going to the hoops and somebody feeding it to them as they’re cutting to the hoop. Every generation has dudes with killer hops that dunk. I watched Dominique, Worthy, Dr. J, Orlando Woolridge, Darryl Dawkins, Darrell Griffith , etc. fly through the air.</p>

<p>Not sure if there has been a rivalry as contentious and talented as the 80’s Celtics/Lakers and even the Celtics/76ers.</p>

<p>The Lakers had a HOF GM, coach, Magic, Worthy, Kareem and Cooper. The Celts had HOF credentials in ownership, GM, Bird, McHale, Parrish, and Dennis Johnson.</p>

<p>That’s a crap-ton of talent and supporting talent butting heads.</p>

      <label for="lmmutcj" class="commentText"><p>I’ve been watching since the late 80s and there were terrible years after Jordan leaving the Bulls that wasn’t great basketball just because the game was so slow with low scoring. Outside of that, there were always  great players and great storylines that made NBA fun to watch. I think the superteam era is overblown. No superteam has ever really lived up to the hype. Miami with Lebron should have won 4 rings and Warriors with KD also should have at least 4 rings. Hell Lakers with Malone and Payton should have at least beaten Detroit.</p>

<p>If anything, it makes the league more interesting to watch. I will say the biggest drop has been the Allstar game. People use to get so amped for that. It was like a mini-Super Bowl.</p>

As a fan I dont like seeing a game where the best players arent playing. Imagine saving all that money just to get notified before the game that your favorite player isnt playing because of &ldquo;load management&rdquo;</p>

Something is just lacking in today’s players that past players had. I think it’s a combination of charisma and showmanship or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Watching guys like Kobe, Tmac, AI, KG, Dirk, Duncan, Shaq, young Lebron and D wade. Those are just legendary players and I got to see all of them compete at a high level.</p>

The 2016 warriors going for 73 and needing it to keep off the Thunder and Spurs was great to watch. I started watching around 2001, cheering for AI’s Sixers against the Lakers. Now is pretty fun, much better than the kinda boring mid-2000s ball.</p>
