<p>That happened to coincide with an era where scoring 100 points was a great offensive night and likely to get you a win. That made for very easy watching.</p>

The NBA knows that most people only focus on a game when time is almost up and it&rsquo;s still close, so there&rsquo;s no better time to force feed the ads and promotions.</p>

      <label for="lmml552" class="commentText"><p>I tend to agree. For the first year or two of what came to be known as Moreyball, it was exciting to see such high scoring affairs, with players lighting up box score sheets and obliterating single-season records left and right. But now that we&rsquo;re a decade into it, the style has gotten stale. It seems the sport has gained a lot of efficiency at the expense of its artistry.</p>

      <label for="lmmjdyz" class="commentText"><p>Hopefully you realized it was an all-time great era at the time and made sure to soak it in.  I kind of knew at the time that we were spoiled and may never witness another period where so many all time greats are at their peaks at the same exact time. Not long from now, we&rsquo;ll look back and realize that our latest Olympic run was the literal end of an era. The last piece of hardware for 3 of the top 15 players of all time.</p>

<p>While the players you mentioned will likely give us another 2-3 years of solid play, I&rsquo;d be genuinely surprised if any of those guys get another chip before retiring.</p>

      <label for="lmmih55" class="commentText"><p>Watching actual games? I&rsquo;m not so sure. Foul-baiting, free-throws, commercials, gambling. Feels like it&rsquo;s never been this bad. It&rsquo;s the best sport in the world but the NBA does it&rsquo;s best to ruin it. They put out such a terrible product, it&rsquo;s borderline unwatchable with all the breaks and commercials.</p>

<p>Following the league as a whole? Absolutely. I&rsquo;d never want to go back to the 2010&rsquo;s with superteam after superteam and the regular season being foregone conclusions. We are in a golden age of parity and there has never been this many teams fighting for the chip. The talent is at an all time high as well, every team has a star or 2.</p>

      <label for="lmmicko" class="commentText"><p>For me, there&rsquo;s two parts. Watching a game live, and the &ldquo;fun factor&rdquo; of keeping up with teams / players / drama.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&rsquo;t gamble, I don&rsquo;t love how much it&rsquo;s started to impact watching the sport. Whether that&rsquo;s just perceptions or impacting gameplay is obviously up for debate, but I anticipate the vibes only getting worse over the next few seasons. But between that and the insane frequency and length of ad breaks, I definitely did enjoy the watching games more in the past.</p>

<p>But as far as enjoying the game, being able to engage and talk shit with other people live, getting to see highlights from games the next day (whenever you want!!), and&hellip; talking more shit afterwards, it&rsquo;s SO much more fun now.</p>

<p>My favorite player is still AI, which is when I got really into watching, but in the Jordan era basketball was just ubiquitous.</p>

      <label for="lmmf1fm" class="commentText"><p>It’s more than reasonable to say I’m biased given I grew up watching late 90s/2000s basketball and my team won a lot but 2000s was the most fun era to watch in general imo.</p>

<p>I still love modern basketball and I know it’s a cliche complaint, but I’m sorry, the meta of teams launching 40 3s per game and positionless basketball is just not as spectator friendly. Players are way more talented and you still get amazing moments but generally midrange and post game ball was just more entertaining to me. It was less efficient but it just felt cooler. And when shooting big men like Dirk were a rarity who could stretch the floor it made those skillsets that much more game changing.</p>

      <label for="lmmggef" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think it’s as simple as that, the nba has highs and lows in terms of fun level and they aren’t linear</p>

<p>For example, as a theoretical unbiased viewer the nba was probably really fun in 2008-2012, prime Kobe lakers vs heatles vs big 3 Celtics vs spurs vs up and coming teams like kd thunder, ton of star power and really competitive basketball</p>

<p>And then again, 2015-2016 was one of the best stretches ever with the 73 win warriors and all the parity and storylines from that time</p>

<p>But you follow that with the kd warriors which wasn’t fun at all for someone who just wants parity, and then shortly after that the pandemic, we definitely had a rough stretch</p>

<p>I think it’s coming back around though, the young guys behind lebron Steph and kd are entering their prime so we are finally entering into a new era of stars and the league has a ton of parity, been a new champ every year since the warriors, I think it’s gonna be a great next few years</p>

      <label for="lmmgspj" class="commentText"><p>2018-2022 was really really bad. The defensive touch fouls in addition to offensive players being able to create any contact they wanted was just putrid basketball.</p>

<p>I think they really cleaned it up this past year. They allowed way more contact, especially in the playoffs. Going forward they need to maintain this. The spacing, sets, and skills are super fun to watch right now.</p>

      <label for="lmmhnom" class="commentText"><p>The talent is off the charts better. 5th and 6th guys today would be role players in the early 2000&rsquo;s. The agility / athleticism and shot making is way more fun / impressive.</p>

<p>The grit / competitiveness is nowhere near the same as back in the day so it&rsquo;s harder to be as devoted to players or teams when they don&rsquo;t seem to care as much.</p>

<p>The shot selections can be awesome or tedious. Seeing a bunch of missed threes sucks. I also miss the post-up game.</p>

      <label for="lmmjd6w" class="commentText"><p>The off seasons are the most fun right now, i don&rsquo;t think in any era the regular season mattered outside of nationalized tv games and the playoffs are really good just like it always was.</p>

<p>The big difference between this era and say 10 or 20 years ago is the parity and how many teams are actually competing for the title, not sure if it&rsquo;s better for ratings to have 2 teams that are true competitors or 4-8 like we have now but that&rsquo;s the main difference imo.</p>

Before LeBron left Cleveland, I feel like it was really fun rooting for him and seeing him dominate while growing. But imo the league has more visible stars, and the speed and spacing of those Warriors teams facing Durant and Westbrook on the Thunder, Harden leading the Rockets, and Bron finally reaching the ultra elite level was all amazing to me</p>

      <label for="lmmhm39" class="commentText"><p>Started in late 80&rsquo;s. 90&rsquo;s were rough times, slow pace and lack of shooting to stretch the defense made for some snoozefests. Late 90&rsquo;s early 00&rsquo;s were my favourite, loved the Webber/Divac/Williams Kings and Don Nelson Dallas teams, they were a joy to watch.</p>

<p>I grew up watching European basketball, so I prefer offense with a lot of motion, iso feels boring. I feel like NBA is finally getting a modern game it deserves, offense is more structured with less 1-on-1 and iso and more team motion to create space. I don&rsquo;t mind the positionless aspect, big guys who can&rsquo;t shoot or pass have no place on the court anyways.</p>

Though I think the era a lot of people here (based on age, style preferences, etc) will prefer is the mid to late 2010&rsquo;s as it had elements of previous eras while also seeing some teams start emphasizing more of the pace and space style we currently see.</p>

You get to see the skill of players 1-5 the openness and space of the court which this applies to all teams. You had teams that were fun to watch as they were outliers like the Showtime Lakers, 7 seconds or less, Bird Celtics, 80s Nuggets, Suns, Run TMC Warriors, 90s Sonics. Now even though the bad teams are in the league they style of play they have can be exciting, its not good but exciting. Compared to the slow pace, walk the ball up the court, 5 seconds left running the offense, by throwing it down to a big man that wasnt elite bad teams.</p>

Its easy to idolize people back then (early 2000s). Almost each of us then had our idols and we pattern our game to them. Nowadays, theres a lot more hating, legacy points. Comparing eras bs.</p>

<p>As for watching the games, id go to the early 2000s where reaching 100 pts is an epic night, someone reaching 40pts is also a hot topic the next day, and a triple double is as rare as a shiny mewtwo. And oh, when a 3 pointer is such a celebration.</p>

<p>Finally. When all star games are not for the soft and spoiled millionares.</p>

      <label for="lmml952" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching since the mid 1980s, and I&rsquo;d say the amount of talent in the league right now is very high compared to most eras I&rsquo;ve seen. Seems like almost every team has at least one must-watch player &ndash; any many of the top guys are obscenely talented and frankly much better than the top players in previous decades. Anyway, that&rsquo;s what makes it fun for me.</p>
