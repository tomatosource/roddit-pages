<p>The Celtics have nobody on that tier (though the Mavs do), but they have a top tier supporting cast. Probably the best supporting cast since the KD Warriors.</p>

<p>The number 1s on most of those teams can be both. Giannis, Jokic and Steph have been way better than anyone else on their teams, while Lebron had AD.</p>

      <label for="l9142lr" class="commentText"><p>And since it&rsquo;s an award for a single series, the FMVP ends up being a reflection of how the opponent chose to defend, rather than who actually played well. I&rsquo;ve always thought it should be Playoffs MVP. We have an MVP for the regular season, we should have one for the playoffs. Making it just for the finals makes it so the first three rounds of the playoffs are not reflected in any award voting, which is crazy since the Western Conference Finals have been the &ldquo;real finals&rdquo; several times over the last twenty five years.</p>

      <label for="l91o6bp" class="commentText"><p>When opposing defenses load up and game plan for a single individual talent, it generally results in 2nd tier talent feasting.  Several examples of this strategy just not working.  On the flip side, you have examples of series where opposing defenses just let the alpha do his thing against 1 on 1 defense, focused on stopping the team as a whole entity, and succeeded.  That&rsquo;s how you get guys like Michael Jordan dropping 63 against the Celtics, but also never once winning a playoff game against the Celtics while a guy like Larry Bird can average 15 against the Rockets in the finals, lose &ldquo;FMVP&rdquo; to the beneficiary of this strategy, but be the actual most important reason his team won.</p>

<p>Long way of saying, assuming Boston manages to actually win this series it seems likely someone other than Tatum will win FMVP but it will not change the fact that Tatum has been his team&rsquo;s most valuable player all playoffs - including every Finals game.</p>

The issue is that the Mavs need both of Kyrie and Luka to be good to win. Their margin of victory is so slim when the Celtics have been able to get by with bad Tatum games because they have Brown, KP, White, and Holliday</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To the extent that it&rsquo;s true for Curry? Not at all. Against most stars, you&rsquo;re doubling them once they get the ball at their sweet spots, at the point of attack on a PnR, and by bringing late help on drives to the basket.</p>

<p>For Curry, you&rsquo;re literally defending him with all 5 players at all times because of his off ball movement. Defending Curry is wildly different from defending nearly every other superstar in NBA history.</p>

Pulling defenders to the logo create 4v3 halfcourt situations, which not only creates open threes (like Giannis or Bron driving do), but also easy cuts for open dunks or lobs.</p>

<p>The warriors were routinely the team with the dunks despite not having nothing remotely close to a Giannis volume dunker. That was created by Steph, a guy who never dunks.</p>

<p>Like in 1985, where people telling Magic his ring didn’t “count” because Kareem was the finals mvp? What about Kareem in 80 when Magic won the award?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s different from Tatum where he&rsquo;s been his team&rsquo;s most important player on offense and arguably his team&rsquo;s most important player on defense as well.</p>

<p>The only thing that changed from then till the 2008-2010 run is that he took more 3s.</p>

      <label for="l91fr22" class="commentText"><p>Nah, you don&rsquo;t need FMVP to talk about how Kobe&rsquo;s five rings aren&rsquo;t the same as Jordan&rsquo;s six.</p>

<p>Shaq wasn&rsquo;t just FMVP, he was indisputably the best player on the team. It&rsquo;s not comparable to today where Tatum was the better player all season long but Jaylen Brown is pretty good too and maybe outplayed him in the finals. For the Lakers 3peat Shaq was the most dominant force in the league. Kobe was maybe the most overqualified Robin ever but he was still clearly Robin.</p>

      <label for="l91p846" class="commentText"><p>yes and by &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; we mean &ldquo;best counting stats&rdquo;.  I still think Tatum has been his team&rsquo;s most valuable player in every Finals game, but he hasn&rsquo;t got the same counting stats in part because he&rsquo;s the focus of the opposing defense and in part because he&rsquo;s missed shots.  But his impact on both ends is hard to argue against.</p>

When Magic won in 1980 Kareem had already proved that he could be the guy on a finals team because he won a championship and FMVP in 1971. Similarly in 1985 Magic had already proven it by winning FMVP in 1980 and 1982. Curry before he won it or Kobe during the Shaq years would be more comparable.</p>

<p>KD: 28/11/8 on 65% TS</p>

<p>Curry: 28/6/7 on 56% TS</p>

<p>A 9% difference in efficiency, KD is obviously a vastly better defender because of length and size.</p>

Sure Curry got more defensive attention at times but KD capitalized upon it and was very productive. He definitely earned that FMVP and had a good argument for both of them.</p>

<p>I know people love Curry and hate KD on here but maybe don&rsquo;t be a dumbass who thinks KD was wide open every possession?</p>

      <label for="l912wdb" class="commentText"><p>2018 Steph had that one awful game, I think it was game 3 where KD also shot a game-winner. When a series ends in 4 games, you can&rsquo;t afford to be bad for 25% of it.</p>

<p>Just going off the top of my head, in 2018, KD had better stats than Curry in every category except steals, and he shot better. His defence was also better.</p>

<p>I mean, I understand that Steph got more defensive attention at times, and he&rsquo;s the reason that the system works so well, but it&rsquo;s tough to say he played better than KD in that finals even taking that into account.</p>

KD scored slightly more, took down more rebounds, dished out more assists and his efficiency was miles better, 10% higher TS than Steph’s. Steph shot barely 40% from the field, KD put up 50/40/90 shooting splits and played much better defense as well.</p>

      <label for="l91nxgl" class="commentText"><p>Why can&rsquo;t people understand that KD might&rsquo;ve been better in the finals, but throughout the year his argument for being the better player becomes much weaker?</p>

<p>Durant had both of his best series against the Cavs in both the 2017 and 2018 playoffs, Curry had both of his weakest series against the Cavs in the 2017 and 2018 playoffs. It might just be a case where Durant matched up better against those specific teams(Those Cavs teams were below average defenses both years by the way).</p>

<p>The gap between how they play with Curry and no Durant vs Durant and no Curry is massive, theres about a 25 win pace difference. If there box score numbers look similar year by year, why is Curry adding way more wins?</p>

<p>Curry&rsquo;s estimated shot creation for his teammates far outpace Durant, there are models that try to capture his shot creation and his shot creation is at an all time great level. Durant is just nowhere near that level as a shot creator/playmaker, that massive difference just doesn&rsquo;t show up in Curry&rsquo;s assists but it absolutely does exist.</p>

<p>Curry was easily the Warriors best player in every conference finals he played in, and I don’t think any of them are even that arguable. And btw in 2018 the conference finals was by far their hardest series.</p>

      <label for="l912wob" class="commentText"><p>If it makes you feel better, had the Nets not made that trade they would not have bottomed out so bad and would have never gotten a chance at Tatum or Brown themselves anyways.</p>

<p>Now with that out of the way, yes, if the Celtics win a ring or two that trade is probably going to end up the worst trade in NBA history.  The craziest part is that the Celtics flipped the 3rd pick (2018) for Kyrie and the Cavs took Sexton.  Ainge said they guy he would have taken was none other than Shai Gilgeous.  So there&rsquo;s a parallel universe right now with all 3 of Tatum, SGA, and Jaylen winning like 5 titles in a row.</p>

      <label for="l91bfk2" class="commentText"><p>I mean, KG was, what, 35 in &lsquo;13? PP was 33? They clearly wanted more but their bodies were too hurt from what I remember. Nets had a great plan from my perspective but it didn&rsquo;t turn out so well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have Al Horford who is 38 in the NBA Finals. We have him in a position where he should be the back-up for the primary center off the bench, but when they have been hurt like KP and Rob Williams have been, he still sees a lot of start time. An enigma? Maybe. Tom Brady&rsquo;s secret sauce? Shhhhhhh&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l90yajo" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a great response and he&rsquo;s right. Even though it might seem weird to some people that Iggy won Finals MVP that first Golden State title I don&rsquo;t think most reasonable people discredited Steph. We saw how that first Finals went with Iggy and LeBron. I don&rsquo;t think reasonable people discredited Kobe. It&rsquo;s about the journey getting to the Finals as well.</p>

<p>Now with that said reasonable people aren&rsquo;t on TV 20+ hours a week spouting off shit takes. And if Brown wins you just know the Tatum slander is going to be out there. It&rsquo;s like some people have this weird agenda against the guy when I&rsquo;ve personally never seen a reason to dislike Tatum. If he wins a ring he accomplished the ultimate goal and that&rsquo;s all that matters, fuck anyone who tries to discredit that.</p>

<p>Plus he&rsquo;s young. He&rsquo;ll have more opportunities. This isn&rsquo;t a fluke run.</p>

I used to think people just thought he was overrated which is whatever, it&rsquo;s probably at least a little true. But now I think these people genuinely hate him for some reason and actively root for him to fail. I find it strange bc Tatum is so vanilla and boring as a personality</p>

      <label for="l916rjh" class="commentText"><p>I truly believe it’s because so many people are fans of individual players, not teams. So if your entire identity is built around idolizing LeBron/Giannis/Butler/etc, a star player underperforming just gives you more ammo for your shtick. Whereas if you’re a fan of a team, you couldn’t care less who wins FMVP. Hell, give it to Luka for all I care as long as Boston secures the banner.</p>

All u see in retaliation to steph praise he doesn&rsquo;t have a fmvp like that award made him a lesser player than others. I can respect your opinion on fmvp because it&rsquo;s a worthless award to me for that heist pulled in the 15 finals. In general fmvp meant the best player on a winning team playing at worst very good. For some reason 2015 didn&rsquo;t fit the narrative being pushed. Every other yr before and after did which i find very interesting</p>

      <label for="l919qjf" class="commentText"><p>I’m a Jayson Tatum fan. He’s my favorite player. But more than that I’m a Celtics fan, and I truly do believe he knows which proper noun on his jersey is the important one. I mean are people really rooting for a FMVP over just a championship for their team? He can’t hit the broad side of a barn right now which sucks, but as long as he’s contributing overall to us winning I don’t care if he has the best series.</p>

      <label for="l90zmhb" class="commentText"><p>Side tangent about Isiah Thomas&mdash;I think he might have been slightly overrated because since he was the best player on two title-winning teams, people look at him with the more modern player vs player lens as him &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; the team when it was more of a group effort. In the years where they went to the Finals (1988-1990), he was not in the MVP discussion, and did not make All-NBA. To be completely fair, there were only two All-NBA teams until the 1988-89 season. He never won MVP, and I was surprised that he never really came close (5th in 1984 and that&rsquo;s it).</p>

Brown is averaging 20.08 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.8 assist but more efficient at 49%. So it really depends on your narrative. You can make a case for either one whoever you want to win. So as I say with everything, context matters and in this case it doesn’t mean as much in weight.</p>
