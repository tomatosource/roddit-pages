Lakers dynasty started out while Shaq dominating entirely while Kobe was still a rising star. But Kobe had the benefit of playing with prime Shaq, so he even though he wasn&rsquo;t ready to lead a team to title he was able to collect 3 rings despite 0 Finals MVPS.</p>

<p>Kobe - 15.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.2</p>

      <label for="l923gf6" class="commentText"><p>enough with the kobe only averaging 15 points per game in the 2000 nba finals, you guys keep forgetting that jalen rose intentionally injured his ankle in game 2 of the finals when he only played 9 minutes and had 2 points. that game is still counted in the average. if you go by the 4 full games he played, hes averaging 19 points per game as a second option in his first finals with a sprained ankle for most of the series.</p>

<p>when shaq fouled out kobe became the first option and won the lakers the game in OT (120-118) in game 4 scoring 28 points, which is very respectable and was the difference between a tight 2-2 series vs a comfortable 3-1 lead with game 5 being in indiana (2-3-2 finals format back then). indiana blew out the lakers by 30 in game 5 btw, so lakers couldve  very well been down 3-2 if it wasnt for kobes heroics in game 4 ( on a sprained ankle btw) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSdhzK-ud3U&amp;ab_channel=sburkha3" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSdhzK-ud3U&amp;ab_channel=sburkha3</a></p>

<p>yes kobe wasnt first option in his first 3 titles but actually study the context instead of just reading the box score</p>

It&rsquo;s almost like getting intentionally hurt by your opponent will fuck up your averages. Kobe was averaging 23/4/5 with All-Defensive First Team calibre of defense up until the Finals, Shaq wouldn&rsquo;t have made past the Kings in the 1st Round without him.</p>

<p>2001 is a great example of this, Kobe was straight up BETTER than Shaq overall in that run, but a bunch of people that never watched a single game of that 3-peat repeat &ldquo;BUT SHAQ WAS FINALS MVP THOUGH&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The Celtics have nobody on that tier (though the Mavs do), but they have a top tier supporting cast. Probably the best supporting cast since the KD Warriors.</p>

<p>The number 1s on most of those teams can be both. Giannis, Jokic and Steph have been way better than anyone else on their teams, while Lebron had AD.</p>

      <label for="l9265nu" class="commentText"><p>I think the narrative then was that if Iguodala remained the 6th man that whole series, Lebron would’ve singehandedly beat the Warriors anyway… As he led Cavs to 2-1 lead with the 1 loss being in OT. Then when Iggy was made a starter the Warriors won the next 3. </p>

<p>Also Steph took the biggest leap of an MVP winner ever after that season, so he wasn’t really seen the same way as is he is now. He was closer to a D-Rose/Nash level MVP that year, not top 10-12 player all time</p>

      <label for="l9142lr" class="commentText"><p>And since it&rsquo;s an award for a single series, the FMVP ends up being a reflection of how the opponent chose to defend, rather than who actually played well. I&rsquo;ve always thought it should be Playoffs MVP. We have an MVP for the regular season, we should have one for the playoffs. Making it just for the finals makes it so the first three rounds of the playoffs are not reflected in any award voting, which is crazy since the Western Conference Finals have been the &ldquo;real finals&rdquo; several times over the last twenty five years.</p>

      <label for="l91o6bp" class="commentText"><p>When opposing defenses load up and game plan for a single individual talent, it generally results in 2nd tier talent feasting.  Several examples of this strategy just not working.  On the flip side, you have examples of series where opposing defenses just let the alpha do his thing against 1 on 1 defense, focused on stopping the team as a whole entity, and succeeded.  That&rsquo;s how you get guys like Michael Jordan dropping 63 against the Celtics, but also never once winning a playoff game against the Celtics while a guy like Larry Bird can average 15 against the Rockets in the finals, lose &ldquo;FMVP&rdquo; to the beneficiary of this strategy, but be the actual most important reason his team won.</p>

<p>Long way of saying, assuming Boston manages to actually win this series it seems likely someone other than Tatum will win FMVP but it will not change the fact that Tatum has been his team&rsquo;s most valuable player all playoffs - including every Finals game.</p>

<p>To the extent that it&rsquo;s true for Curry? Not at all. Against most stars, you&rsquo;re doubling them once they get the ball at their sweet spots, at the point of attack on a PnR, and by bringing late help on drives to the basket.</p>

<p>For Curry, you&rsquo;re literally defending him with all 5 players at all times because of his off ball movement. Defending Curry is wildly different from defending nearly every other superstar in NBA history.</p>

Pulling defenders to the logo create 4v3 halfcourt situations, which not only creates open threes (like Giannis or Bron driving do), but also easy cuts for open dunks or lobs.</p>

<p>The warriors were routinely the team with the most dunks despite not having nothing remotely close to a Giannis volume dunker. That was created by Steph, a guy who ironically, never dunks.</p>

<p>Shaq wasn&rsquo;t just FMVP, he was indisputably the best player on the team. It&rsquo;s not comparable to today where Tatum was the better player all season long but Jaylen Brown is pretty good too and maybe outplayed him in the finals. For the Lakers 3peat Shaq was the most dominant force in the league. Kobe was maybe the most overqualified Robin ever but he was still clearly Robin.</p>

I still think Tatum has been his team&rsquo;s most valuable player in every Finals game, but he hasn&rsquo;t got the same counting stats in part because he&rsquo;s the focus of the opposing defense and in part because he&rsquo;s missed shots.  But his impact on both ends is hard to argue against.</p>

      <label for="l90x0of" class="commentText"><p>I think its more Lebron vs Curry or earlier with Kobe not having a ring without Shaq. Lebron&rsquo;s problem was not having as many rings as Jordan not the amount of finals MVPs since he always won that.</p>

      <label for="l918npa" class="commentText"><p>FMVP was a talking point before Curry really blew up. Def used with Kobe in regards to his years with Shaq. I also clearly remember it being used on Bron after his ‘11 finals series where some thought he intentionally threw the series away so that Wade couldn’t win FMVP (which is lol).</p>

      <label for="l90yx61" class="commentText"><p>Bad examples. When Magic won in 1980 Kareem had already proved that he could be the guy on a finals team because he won a championship and FMVP in 1971. Similarly in 1985 Magic had already proven it by winning FMVP in 1980 and 1982. Curry before he won it or Kobe during the Shaq years would be more comparable.</p>

      <label for="l923qw7" class="commentText"><p>Magic&rsquo;s 1980 FMVP describes the throwaway nature of the award though back then.</p>

<p>He got the award only because Kareem injured his ankle in G5 and, rather than flying to Philly, he rested in LA. So he wasn&rsquo;t present to accept the award and the NBA wanted to give it to someone there in person, and Magic put up an unexpected Herculean G6 production.</p>

<p>But Kareem was far better than Magic in the series. But nobody cared who got the FMVP because nobody cared about the award.</p>

      <label for="l91nxgl" class="commentText"><p>Why can&rsquo;t people understand that KD might&rsquo;ve been better in the finals, but throughout the year his argument for being the better player becomes much weaker?</p>

<p>Durant had both of his best series against the Cavs in both the 2017 and 2018 playoffs, Curry had both of his weakest series against the Cavs in the 2017 and 2018 playoffs. It might just be a case where Durant matched up better against those specific teams(Those Cavs teams were below average defenses both years by the way).</p>

<p>The gap between how they play with Curry and no Durant vs Durant and no Curry is massive, theres about a 25 win pace difference. If there box score numbers look similar year by year, why is Curry adding way more wins?</p>

<p>Curry&rsquo;s estimated shot creation for his teammates far outpace Durant, there are models that try to capture his shot creation and his shot creation is at an all time great level. Durant is just nowhere near that level as a shot creator/playmaker, that massive difference just doesn&rsquo;t show up in Curry&rsquo;s assists but it absolutely does exist.</p>

      <label for="l9105v9" class="commentText"><p>There is no case in 2018 lol. KD had another crazy finals. The stats are just not close. Reddit has tried to revise this period after Steph won in 22, but KD was the x factor here for easily swatting the Cavs after losing in 7 in 2016</p>

<p>KD: 28/11/8 on 65% TS</p>

<p>Curry: 28/6/7 on 56% TS</p>

<p>A 9% difference in efficiency, KD is obviously a vastly better defender because of length and size.</p>

      <label for="l914n5j" class="commentText"><p>This is such a stupid generalization of how it worked. Do you really think KD got left open every possession or something? Sure Curry got more defensive attention at times but KD capitalized upon it and was very productive. He definitely earned that FMVP and had a good argument for both of them.</p>

<p>I know people love Curry and hate KD on here but maybe don&rsquo;t be a dumbass who thinks KD was wide open every possession?</p>

      <label for="l912wdb" class="commentText"><p>2018 Steph had that one awful game, I think it was game 3 where KD also shot a game-winner. When a series ends in 4 games, you can&rsquo;t afford to be bad for 25% of it.</p>

<p>Just going off the top of my head, in 2018, KD had better stats than Curry in every category except steals, and he shot better. His defence was also better.</p>

<p>I mean, I understand that Steph got more defensive attention at times, and he&rsquo;s the reason that the system works so well, but it&rsquo;s tough to say he played better than KD in that finals even taking that into account.</p>

      <label for="l910154" class="commentText"><p>He really did not have a case because after all, the award is mostly based on raw numbers. KD scored slightly more, took down more rebounds, dished out more assists and his efficiency was miles better, 10% higher TS than Steph’s. Steph shot barely 40% from the field, KD put up 50/40/90 shooting splits and played much better defense as well.</p>

<p>Now with that out of the way, yes, if the Celtics win a ring or two that trade is probably going to end up the worst trade in NBA history.  The craziest part is that the Celtics flipped the 3rd pick (2018) for Kyrie and the Cavs took Sexton.  Ainge said they guy he would have taken was none other than Shai Gilgeous.  So there&rsquo;s a parallel universe right now with all 3 of Tatum, SGA, and Jaylen winning like 5 titles in a row.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have Al Horford who is 38 in the NBA Finals. We have him in a position where he should be the back-up for the primary center off the bench, but when they have been hurt like KP and Rob Williams have been, he still sees a lot of start time. An enigma? Maybe. Tom Brady&rsquo;s secret sauce? Shhhhhhh&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

Even though it might seem weird to some people that Iggy won Finals MVP that first Golden State title I don&rsquo;t think most reasonable people discredited Steph. We saw how that first Finals went with Iggy and LeBron. I don&rsquo;t think reasonable people discredited Kobe. It&rsquo;s about the journey getting to the Finals as well.</p>

<p>Now with that said reasonable people aren&rsquo;t on TV 20+ hours a week spouting off shit takes. And if Brown wins you just know the Tatum slander is going to be out there. It&rsquo;s like some people have this weird agenda against the guy when I&rsquo;ve personally never seen a reason to dislike Tatum. If he wins a ring he accomplished the ultimate goal and that&rsquo;s all that matters, fuck anyone who tries to discredit that.</p>

<p>Plus he&rsquo;s young. He&rsquo;ll have more opportunities. This isn&rsquo;t a fluke run.</p>

I can respect your opinion on fmvp because it&rsquo;s a worthless award to me for that heist pulled in the 15 finals. In general fmvp meant the best player on a winning team playing at worst very good. For some reason 2015 didn&rsquo;t fit the narrative being pushed.

But more than that I’m a Celtics fan, and I truly do believe he knows which proper noun on his jersey is the important one. I mean are people really rooting for a FMVP over just a championship for their team? He can’t hit the broad side of a barn right now which sucks, but as long as he’s contributing overall to us winning I don’t care if he has the best series.</p>

      <label for="l90zmhb" class="commentText"><p>Side tangent about Isiah Thomas&mdash;I think he might have been slightly overrated because since he was the best player on two title-winning teams, people look at him with the more modern player vs player lens as him &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; the team when it was more of a group effort. In the years where they went to the Finals (1988-1990), he was not in the MVP discussion, and did not make All-NBA. To be completely fair, there were only two All-NBA teams until the 1988-89 season. He never won MVP, and I was surprised that he never really came close (5th in 1984 and that&rsquo;s it).</p>

Brown is averaging 20.08 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.8 assist but more efficient at 49%. So it really depends on your narrative. You can make a case for either one whoever you want to win. So as I say with everything, context matters and in this case it doesn’t mean as much in weight.</p>
