<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Mavs can win with a rookie in the Finals it&rsquo;s that simple.  I cant see where anyone has won with rookie getting minutes in the last 30 years.  It&rsquo;s kind of a big flaw in their lineup. Experience and defensive IQ is really important this deep.</p>

      <label for="l7jwvea" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Boston&rsquo;s just so ridiculously experienced with playoff basketball at this point. I do think people sometimes overrate the advantages of playoff experience (or at least overrate the advantages of 90 games vs 30 games of experience), but it definitely helps.</p>

<p>Derrick White would have the second-most playoff experience on the Mavs, he&rsquo;s only 5th among the Celtics.</p>

<p>Kyrie Irving wouldn&rsquo;t crack Boston&rsquo;s top 3 for most playoffs games played (and in terms of playoff minutes, he&rsquo;s ~200 ahead of Jrue, but ~500 behind Brown, ~800 behind Tatum, and ~2800 minutes behind Horford).</p>

<p><strong>Boston:</strong></p>

<p>Horford -182 playoff games<br>
Brown - 120<br>
Tatum -109<br>
Jrue - 85<br>
White - 68<br>
Porzingis - 15</p>

<p><strong>Dallas:</strong></p>

<p>Irving - 92<br>
Luka - 46<br>
Jones - 40<br>
Gafford - 23<br>
Washington - 18<br>
Lively - 17</p>

<p>Kyrie had Lebron doing the game management and whilst luka is close to as good as they come at stuff like that it&rsquo;s not quite the same until you are there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you and OP don&rsquo;t have a point, but the fact is the Mavs are in the Finals with a rookie playing heavy, heavy important minutes. I expect they&rsquo;ll play better next game, and if they do what they&rsquo;ve done to this point, get better every game after that.</p>

<p>Warriors didn’t have business winning that chip: Undersized, Draymond getting benched, Klay a shell of himself.  We lucked out with Poole, Looney and Wiggins peaking in their careers simultaneously. All three have gone downhill since.  Iggy and Otto playing thru pain—they would go on to play only 8 and 23 more games, respectively, in their careers.</p>

      <label for="l7jm5n7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say that Lively&rsquo;s play is one of the reasons they are in the Finals. Lively/Gafford duo has combined for 17.4 PPG, 12.8 RPG while playing good defense, especially Lively. It&rsquo;s Game 1, it&rsquo;s in Boston, and Mavs team is far less experienced. It&rsquo;s normal for them to come out of the gate a bit flat, be nervous, etc. Game 2 will be the real measure of how well Mavs will do.</p>

Lively has been better than Gafford in the playoffs, especialy on the defensive end. The Mavs would not be here without him and i dont think they should go away from him.</p>

<p>Every game i can remeber of the Mavs after a long rest period has been awful, they always look slow, i think they will be better game 2 and Lively is a key piece. He just needs to be confident and that stems from a good start to the game.</p>

<p>People knew he was a rookie before the series started and knew he is the Mavs best center so i dont understand the point of this analysis. Of course its not ideal to depend on a player with low experience but it was a given from the start</p>

<p>None of us make game decisions regardless so from that perspective there is just no point in talking about what we see at all.</p>

<p>Afaik, he isn&rsquo;t really a back it down type of guy, which means he can&rsquo;t punish the defense when they get a size mismatch barring someone like Pritch. It also means the Cs can get away with just an athletic wing to disrupt the lob</p>

<p>In contrast, when Mobley was aggressive in the semis, he was a nightmare because we just had no answer for him. He could create his own shot, and was too fast for Horford and too big for Tatum</p>

<p>Idk if Lively can do that, but like you said it&rsquo;s one game and maybe the Kidd and the Mavs can find a way to get him going</p>

<p>He is not playing the Braun role on the. Nuggets since he is played way more minutes and the Mavs success is detrimental to his production and it’s possible for them to flip the series without him.</p>

<p>They are also the underdog.</p>

      <label for="l7jyeae" class="commentText"><p>Okay so if he said &ldquo;Top 5 minutes&rdquo; or &ldquo;starter minutes&rdquo; that would be less cherry picked, and his point would still stand because Lively is an integral part of the Mavs success. OP extended his point to &ldquo;Top 7&rdquo; to try to hammer his point home about how sophisticated the game is at that level, and CB from the Nuggets last year runs right up against that line, but if you ignore the arbitrary lines that were drawn and just look at the point OP is making about over-reliance on less experienced players at the highest level of the sport, I think there is some merit to what they are saying.</p>

If the Celtics have found the holes in Lively’s game then this thing is over. I think it’s more likely he just had a bad game and will bounce back in game 2</p>

      <label for="l7jvn36" class="commentText"><p>this logic does not compute. CB CLOSED GAMES FOR MPJ. just because the celtics attacked lively in game 1 does not negate what happened last year. maybe CB is just better than lively but it does not take away that he was a rookie last year and the nuggets won. maybe the celtics are just better than the mavs. so just say that. no need to make up fake points to express your opinion.</p>

The Nuggets beat the Celtics twice in the regular season to the extent this is even relevant (and argue it’s not relevant) Braun played 5 minutes in one win and 17 minutes in another win. Lively played 18 minutes last night because he was in extreme foul trouble. The Mavs intended on playing him more minutes</p>

His point is that the game becomes so sophisticated at this level that rookie players largely lack the experience to play at this level and not be exploited.

      <label for="l7jr6mw" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, Gobert has no offensive bag and Chet is a rookie as well. This time he&rsquo;s going against an elite stretch big in KP, plus the rest of the Celtics team attacking him knowing he&rsquo;s gonna foul a lot. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s gonna improve over the series, but being a rookie and taking on that much responsibility in the finals is definitely a factor as well.</p>

<p>Could they have been no calls? Yes</p>

<p>Lively has more playoff games played than KP.</p>

      <label for="l7k0tvz" class="commentText"><p>I posted this same thing yesterday before the game, pointing out the Mavs top 7 is far too young to win a championship.</p>

<p>For example, the Mavs top 7 have an average age of 24 years old. The 2015 warriors are the youngest in the last 10 years at 26. All others are 28-30.</p>

<p>The Mavs giving so many minutes to inexperienced players has zero precedent for winning a champioship.</p>

Fact is Boston punched back and Dallas could not make another punch as they were gassed (luka) after fighting back from 29, mostly Kyrie was nonexistent. They easily couldve slowed down Boston’s run there it Kyrie wasnt clamped</p>

      <label for="l7jxzuw" class="commentText"><p>Lively was in foul trouble because he was out there fouling constantly on defense, but he had a bad game offensively because the Celtics didn&rsquo;t need to double Luka to defend the Mavs and could keep a defender attached to Lively to stop the easy lobs. He should be able to calm down on the defensive end and play more minutes, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an obvious fix to the offensive one. That&rsquo;s not a Lively problem, that&rsquo;s a scheme issue. Maybe Kidd will figure something out, but I&rsquo;d guess if so it would be more along the lines of abandoning the lob-heavy offense to get more shooters and spread things out than getting Lively going. Even in the stretch you mentioned Kyrie had two bad errors alongside Lively&rsquo;s errors. It&rsquo;s not helpful that Lively is a rookie, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a core issue for Dallas.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for the Mavs, the rookie flaw wasnt a big factor when playing lesser opponents.  The Celtics are too smart. When the game gets close they will do what they did last night, attack Lively.</p>

<p>There is a reason Rookies dont play in the NBA finals and this is it.  Regardless of how good he is or him helping you get here.</p>
