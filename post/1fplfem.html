      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fplfem/do_you_have_concerns_about_shot_creation_for_the/"><p>Do you have concerns about shot creation for the Oklahoma City Thunder?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The Thunder on paper are a damn near spotless team. Young, deep, led by a top 5-8 player in the association, a burgeoning sidekick, a top 3 rim protector. Two of the best defensive guards/wings and another in Cason Wallace who is well on his way to becoming one as well. A fantastic C&amp;S player in Isaiah Joe. Hartenstein brings so much to the table on both ends of the floor and so much of what the Thunder needed to shore up.</p>

<p>One question I have about the Thunder going into this season and into the playoffs is shot creation. The Thunder had a very efficient half court offense last year&hellip;Mark D is a great coach that runs fluid sets, they&rsquo;re connected as a unit, multiple ballhandlers, multiple actions, big to big and guard to guard screening, always at least four shooters on the floor, create advantages that they make the most of. But when games slow down in the playoffs, we&rsquo;ve seen the Thunder struggle a bit, which is where you do need guys who can call their own numbers. They did miss open looks in the Mavs series, which is a product of luck, but they&rsquo;re a team you can gum up a bit when games slow down, in part because they don&rsquo;t have that many true creators.</p>

<p>Josh Giddey has limitations in his game and those limitations saw him fall a bit out of favor in OKC and saw he wanting out after losing time in the playoffs. But his secondary playmaking and creation was valuable, more than people seem to realize, for the Thunder. His poor play with the rape scandal hanging over his head hurt his rep but he recovered from that to be a productive piece offensively for OKC afterward last regular season. Think the idea is that JDub can step in and fill much of that role and we did see some great flashes in the playoffs as a passer, and Caruso certainly isn&rsquo;t incapable either. But I wanna ask the community whether or not you think this is a potential concern for the Thunder come playoff time.</p>

Although JDub did not look great in the mavericks series. But they didn’t really seem to trust Giddey so it’s sort of a moot point</p>

      <label for="loyk15i" class="commentText"><p>I think you’re overvaluing what Giddey provided. Half the time he was why the offence got stuck and there’s only so much being a great standstill passer does for you.</p>

<p>Between Shai and third year JDub, Chet having more opportunities and ball handling this season, Cason getting more touches and their style of play I don’t have many concerns. They’ve got so many guys that can handle and keep the ball moving that most of their open looks will come from team basketball while also having 3 guys that project to be able to create offence when needed.</p>

<p>They want to play fast flowing drive and kick style and pretty much everyone they have can play that style (even Caruso even if he will want to just keep it to like two or three dribbles at a time).</p>

<p>Hartenstein is also a really solid passer for a big and can help improve and diversify the flow of offense for the team.</p>

      <label for="loylpw7" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s important to recognize that JDub and Chet are both already somewhat capable of creating shots and the Thunder have had the entire offseason for them to practice, knowing that one of their primary shot creators is gone. The Thunder&rsquo;s team is really young and it&rsquo;s safe to say that this is the worst version of JDub, Chet, Wallace, Wiggins, and Joe that we&rsquo;ll see in a long time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also not really necessary to have that much shot creation in the Thunder&rsquo;s gameplan. After Shai, Chet, and JDub, all of the players on the team more or less have the same role. The idea is that everyone can shoot, defend, and pass smartly. Caruso and Hartenstein are certainly not on Giddey&rsquo;s level when it comes to passing, but they are two of the smarter passers in the league, which can be said about literally everyone else on the roster.</p>

<p>The Thunder&rsquo;s rotation is in a way where either Shai or JDub are on the court at almost all times. When Shai is off, JDub runs the point, and he&rsquo;s more than capable of creating his own shot. JDub&rsquo;s go-to move is a moving mid-range jumper while going left and he shot 53% on jumpers from 10-16 ft.</p>

<p>Once again, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that Chet just finished his very first season in the NBA. He will almost certainly get better at creating as well.</p>

<p>For the love of God, can people stop saying this? No, it was not especially against good teams. All that resulted was teams defending him with their bigs, and suddenly JDub and Chet’s creation are the ones that actually were negatively impacted as a result.</p>

<p>As for the actual question - it’s a concern that the team hopes JDub and Chet can grow into. JDub obviously has shown a lot of isolation chops and playmaking chops, he ran second units when Shai sat (cough cough because Josh was so bad at it) and is a pretty natural passer having play PG most of his life.</p>

<p>So growth + Shai being like a top 3 or 4 offensive half court player in the NBA right now is what we are banking on.</p>

      <label for="loymc5q" class="commentText"><p>No. SGA, Chet, and Dub are all creators. Everyone else stays behind the 3 and shoots when left open.</p>

<p>Giddey didn&rsquo;t work because he had to be a catch and shoot role player on offense, and he&rsquo;s not a strong 3pt shooter. He was rarely a primary playmaker, which is what he wants to be.</p>

<p>Caruso and Giddey are completely different players, but Caruso is a 40% 3pt shooter. He can stay behind the 3 on offense.</p>

<p>Giddey was also the worst defender. Caruso corrects that obviously.</p>

<p>Giddey is a good shot creator but when SGA and Dub are on the court they need the ball. Chet benefits a lot with a guy like giddey, but SGA and Dub can do it just as well.</p>

      <label for="loyto01" class="commentText"><p>Not at all. SGA’s one of the most reliable bucket getters in the entire league and Jalen Williams is a crunch time monster. They’re a fantastic 1-2 punch down the stretch. J-Dub was only 22 for his first playoffs so it makes sense that there was a little adjustment period, but I’d expect him to be MUCH better this year. I think the Thunder are the best team in the NBA. I don’t really see any weaknesses at all.</p>

      <label for="loyuacq" class="commentText"><p>I believe shot creation is one of their strengths tbh. SGA is SGA</p>

<p>JDub has put up elite scoring efficiency and advanced creativity, counters, and decision-making, showing every indicator that he’s capable of handling a leap in offensive responsibility </p>

<p>Caruso, Chet and Hartenstein are all great connective passers and decision-makers </p>

      <label for="loyjz94" class="commentText"><p>kinda related but i didn’t watch too many thunder games, how was SGA as the primary point guard? i know they had giddey but was shai still more of a typical point guard?</p>

<p>also, who would be his backup next year?</p>

      <label for="loylv1m" class="commentText"><p>Shai was the point guard. JDub ran point for the bench usually, but when they were both out, it was a mix of Giddey, Joe, Wiggins, Wallace.</p>

      <label for="loynlc4" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s certainly a quality primary PG with legit PG skills and playmaking ability. Shai was the primary when he shared the floor with Giddey but part of what makes the Thunder as good as they are is the fact the ball really doesn&rsquo;t stick in anyone&rsquo;s hands too much most possessions. Shai is a high iso guy but they don&rsquo;t run a heliocentric offense really.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s gotten better at making passing decisions on the move and is making quicker decisions as a passer&hellip;he also really enjoyed playing with Chet.</p>

<p>Think who the backup is somewhat depends on what the starting lineup is but JDub certainly will continue to see an increase in reps and Caruso/Wallace will get reps. Can see Wallace getting an increase in primary reps.</p>
