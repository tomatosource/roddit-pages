      <label for="lacptbb" class="commentText"><p>I’m not certain it’s good news for Nets fans. The haul looks like more than it is actually going to pan out. If you’re a Nets fan you’ve had an absolutely miserable time for the last 10-15 years due to inflated expectations and absolutely depressing outcomes. Now your team just traded their best player to your cross town rival, in response to a player trade demand, completing their Nova reunion in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Knicks fans are dancing right in front of you. Bridges is publicly visibly very happy to be a Knick. All a Nets fan has is a few picks that are likely to be non-lottery bottom of the first round players. The Nets then bought back their own picks in order to be intentionally terrible for the next 5 or so years.</p>

<p>If you’re a Brooklyn fan you can draw a 20 year line of misery from trading for KG/Truth to possibly being humiliated as Bridges hoists a trophy at MSG sometime before the end of this decade. Meanwhile Brooklyn, a major market team, clearly plans to just be intentionally terrible for the next few years to rebuild via the draft. What player jersey (retired or active) does a diehard Brooklyn fan even wear?</p>

      <label for="lacsdog" class="commentText"><p>It’s better than whatever they had going on last year that’s for sure. At the very least they have direction going forward and a lot of cap space to work with - whether that’s taking on bad contracts for assets to straight up signing someone like Mitchell.</p>

      <label for="lacu6ns" class="commentText"><p>That’s a myopic way of looking at it. Fans don’t root for cap space and late round draft picks. They also didn’t just start rooting for the team last year. If you’re a Brooklyn fan for the last 10-15 or so years you’d much rather field a competitive team than be intentionally terrible for the next few years. You’d also rather not kick off the next tank era by handing your best player over to the Knicks of all teams, in response to a trade demand, for a few picks that will end up at the bottom of the draft.</p>

<p>The Nets could’ve built a playoff team around Bridges if they wanted to do so. They could’ve also traded Bridges to 28 other basketball teams not named the Knicks. They could have embraced not having their own picks and made the team somewhat good. Instead they traded back for their own picks from Houston so they can be terrible at the same time they made the Knicks a title contender.</p>

      <label for="lacy3qw" class="commentText"><p>Of course everyone wants to field a competitive team, but when you’re bad for several years what you really need is hope to actually become competitive. That hope starts with picks and cap space, then you pray it turns into stars so that you actually become that competitive team. Their best player would have literally forced the issue if necessary so instead of it being leaked and forced they got a deal done. Obviously it’s not the ideal situation, but they could have sent their best player away for scraps.</p>

      <label for="lacsa93" class="commentText"><p>I don’t see how Nets fans can celebrate this trade. The Knicks essentially bullied their cross town baby brother team and took the Nets’ best player in exchange for a few picks that in all likelihood will be late first rounders of nominal value. This Knicks squad is young, entering their primes, and was already a 2 seed last year. How valuable do folks think these picks will really be?</p>

<p>The Nets then bought back some of their own picks so they can be intentionally terrible for the next few years as well. Why on earth would a Nets fan be proud or happy that they got 4 non-lottery picks instead of only 3 non-lottery picks for giving the final 28 year old Nova infinity gem to the Knicks?</p>

<p>It’s not like the Nets sent Bridges far off to Sacramento or Houston or something. He’s going to be playing NBA playoff games at MSG next May/June while folks in Brooklyn are wondering who they should take at 28th while wearing a Ben Simmons or Deron Williams jersey. The only lip service is calling this a “haul” and telling Nets fans they should be happy/relieved.</p>

      <label for="lacxhek" class="commentText"><p>With how our roster is constructed, we needed to keep our guys more than our picks.</p>

<p>Being the Nova boys, they’re all essentially around the same 27-29 age range. Our window is in the next five years and every year of maximizing that window is key.</p>

<p>We can’t afford to wait two years to sign Mikal in FA. We can’t wait two years for a late draft pick to maybe develop into something useful. We already saw the value and grit of our core guys. And we need to build upon that while losing as little as possible.</p>

<p>Esp with how the new/current CBA works, we were going to be over the aprons at some point in the next two years. Makes it difficult to trade or sign anyone at that point so we had to make a move like this now.</p>

<p>Knicks made a calculated move at the expense of all future flexibility. They decided that trying to win right now is better than having options in the future.</p>

<p>Nets made a calculated move at the expense of multiple seasons of being terrible. They decided that trying to win in the future is better than having options to win now.</p>

<p>Both teams gain a ton while also losing a ton. Anyone that thinks otherwise doesn’t understand how the nba works.</p>

      <label for="lacyg2z" class="commentText"><p>How crucial was Jrue or KP to your roster this year?</p>

<p>I see it as a similar kind of move in terms of “completing” the team via a significant role player. Yes he’s not a “star” but he allows us to better compete with the landscape of the EC contenders (Tatum/Brown).</p>

<p>Sure it’s an overpay but we overpaid assets (picks) which are less valuable to us than our main assets (players).</p>

<p>We could’ve maybe paid 1-2 less picks by including someone like Deuce, but that would leave a gaping hole at backup PG.</p>

<p>I’m not saying it’s a bad move— the fit makes sense, especially with us as the team to beat in the East, and if it takes y’all over the top the picks won’t matter— but I feel like we should be clear-eyed about the risk here</p>
