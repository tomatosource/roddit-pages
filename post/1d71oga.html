      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d71oga/do_you_agree_with_the_positionless_all_nba_and/"><p>Do you agree with the Positionless All Nba and All Defensive Team Format?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This is the first season  where Nba decided to make all nba and all defensive teams both positionless.</p>

<p>And we saw All Defensive First Team to be almost composed of all Centers. (<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>)</p>

<p>All Nba First Team at least coincidentally or accidentally selected 2 Guards, 2 Forwards, and 1 Center.</p>

<p>But it is possible for the near future to have like 3 Centers and 2 Forwards. Or 3 Guards and 1 Forward, and 1 Center. Or any other combination.</p>

<p>Do you agree with that format?</p>

<p>Or is it actually the same as the Top 5 MVP Racers, and Top 5 Players in the league? And not really a team anymore?</p>

<p>Do you approve of this idea?</p>

<p>People were clamoring for position-less awards for years and now that they have it everyone is pleading for the opposite.</p>

<p>That said, I think the solution is something like All-NBA stay position-less and that maybe the All-Defense team model needs more work.</p>

<p>Like sure, Gobert or Wemby are more impactful defensively because of their size, but there are perimeter guys who standout from the rest of the perimeter defenders and they should be credited just as much as the centers who standout.</p>

      <label for="l6wg8kl" class="commentText"><p>It’s not an actual team though, if two centers have the best two seasons defensively then they should be awarded as such.</p>

<p>Defensive players certainly have roles as do offensive players, but in a switch happy league all guys need to be able to do a bit of everything. I think there is a similar amount of differentiation of roles on both offense and defense</p>

      <label for="l6wgv5y" class="commentText"><p>But the impact of centers is always going to be larger than that of smaller players even if the smaller player is a lot better than the average player in his position compared to how much better the center is than the average center.</p>

<p>Like I would say McDaniels stands out a lot from all the other small forwards compared to how much Wemby stands out from the centers when Gobert is even better or equally as good.</p>

<p>Same for Bam and Davis. If both of them are that good, neither stands out. For me, this year&rsquo;s all defense should&rsquo;ve been one of the Celtics guards as PG, Herb, McDaniels, Davis and Gobert.</p>

      <label for="l6wryhv" class="commentText"><p>A lot of the infield and outfield positions are interchangeable in baseball though. Any SS could play 2B or 3B (and taller guys like Correa could play 1B). Any CF could play LF or RF.</p>

<p>It really depends on the player&rsquo;s skillset though, just like basketball. Like your example, most 1B are slower and probably can&rsquo;t play many other positions. Shortstop and Centerfield are usually only played by the best defensive infielders and outfielders on the team. 1B needs to be at least somewhat tall, 3B needs to have a good arm, etc., but a lot of guys can play multiple positions.</p>

      <label for="l6wdin3" class="commentText"><p>Comparing it baseball doesn’t really make sense when the sports are so different. A basketball team could easily play with no center or two centers for example, but you won’t ever see a baseball team play two catchers at the same time. The positions are way more distinct in baseball</p>

      <label for="l6wozfp" class="commentText"><p>I think its dumb, most especially for defense. Its hard enough to identify who the best defenders are because of the lack of statistical measures, but making it positionless basically makes it a block competition. There&rsquo;s a lot more to defense than rim defense. Wing defenders are just as important, but they get no attention because they aren&rsquo;t front and center. So you&rsquo;ll never see one even make all defense.</p>

      <label for="l6wvlyu" class="commentText"><p>Nope i really dislike. Basketball isn&rsquo;t played without positions so why should the awards be positionless? Sometimes Embiid will be on the second team because there are too many good centers and sometimes DeAndre Jordan will make all-nba because there aren&rsquo;t enough good centers. But it&rsquo;s still an accurate depiction of that particular season. Atleast make it FC/BC if you really wanted to reduce the impact of positions. Right now, there is no difference between first team and the top 5 MVP voting.</p>

At the very least it should be frontcourt/backcourt, otherwise its just going to be 5 centers every year. Its like a hockey all-defense team being all goalies lol, I get it they are the most impactful but there are other positions on a TEAM for a reason.</p>

However it easily could end up just all bigs in other years which I wouldn&rsquo;t like. So in that sense I do think returning to positions makes the most sense.</p>

<p>But there are many cases that a player was a top 10 or even top 5 player in the league but wasn’t selected since his position was too stacked.</p>

<p>This is the logical compromise unless we start counting top 5/top 10 mvp finishes as accolades.</p>

      <label for="l6wprr9" class="commentText"><p>I think the All-Defense team was a bit of unintended consequence.  Voters clearly still wanted to get guards in there, and they basically just decided to give 1st team to the bigs and 2nd team to the smalls.  That wasn&rsquo;t really the idea.</p>

<p>But I do think positionless has a lot of merit elsewhere.  Like the difference between an SG and a SF (and often even PF) is negligible in today&rsquo;s league - they&rsquo;re all just wings - yet voters were being forced to jam a wing in at either Guard or Forward.</p>

<p>Personally I&rsquo;d do the awards positionless but force the voters to vote  by position (just frontcourt and backcourt is fine).  So like if Jaylen Brown gets 30 votes at backcourt and 50 votes at frontcourt, it just counts as 80 votes.  I think this will create more honest teams while also allowing some flexibilty.</p>

It is a good measure of who was the best era after era. That link between the nba eras should be kept.</p>

<p>NBA got rid of it because Embiid and Morey are big cry babies and didn’t want to be stuck behind Jokic.  Which was a dumb move. He wasn’t the first amazing guy to get stuck in the second team because there was somebody better</p>

<p>I don’t have a problem with best 5 guys and forget positions. But what we lose imo is more than what we gain.</p>

      <label for="l6xihje" class="commentText"><p>There are really 3 positions in modern basketball: center, point guard (ball handler/playmaker), and wing. Defensively, there are really only 2: center and everyone else. The easiest to grade defensively are centers as they have a more limited role and their impact is way more easily measured. Theoretically, the best perimeter defender would force the ball out of his man&rsquo;s hands 100% of the time and never have to contest a shot which is incredibly hard to measure. So I can somewhat understand why C&rsquo;s would dominate the All-Defense list, though I don&rsquo;t agree with it. For All NBA selection, I prefer no position preference.</p>

And today&rsquo;s game has evolved past traditional positions too much. Many power forwards frequently slide to the 5 for small ball lineups, how do you classify those? Some teams play three guard lineups, which of those do you then declare the small forward? It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to try to press the game into this rigid structure anymore.</p>
