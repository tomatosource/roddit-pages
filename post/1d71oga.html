      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d71oga/do_you_agree_with_the_positionless_all_nba_and/"><p>Do you agree with the Positionless All Nba and All Defensive Team Format?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This is the first season  where Nba decided to make all nba and all defensive teams both positionless.</p>

<p>And we saw All Defensive First Team to be almost composed of all Centers. (<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>)</p>

<p>All Nba First Team at least coincidentally or accidentally selected 2 Guards, 2 Forwards, and 1 Center.</p>

<p>But it is possible for the near future to have like 3 Centers and 2 Forwards. Or 3 Guards and 1 Forward, and 1 Center. Or any other combination.</p>

<p>Do you agree with that format?</p>

<p>Or is it actually the same as the Top 5 MVP Racers, and Top 5 Players in the league? And not really a team anymore?</p>

<p>Do you approve of this idea?</p>

      <label for="l6yo8y6" class="commentText"><p>Yeah earlier advanced stats models are a bit iffy sometimes, but they are generally pretty damn accurate at rating who the &lsquo;best&rsquo; players are. Their flaws usually come in small sample size variances and out of position stats, though newer models correct for this.</p>

<p>DJ put up 4 straight years of 11+ WS. Bam hasn&rsquo;t even hit 9 once, Porzingis has never hit 8. He&rsquo;d probably be around the 4th or 5th spot, right next to Gobert. He was also playing in an era that yes had 3 point shooting, but it still hadn&rsquo;t been fully &lsquo;Curry-ized&rsquo; yet. At the start of his peak, teams took on average 21.5 3s per game. They now take <strong>35.1</strong>. DJ in fully modern spacing would be an absolute terror as a lobthreat and mismatch bully. Insane rebounder, could dunk anything even remotely thrown his way, and is still the all-time leader in career FG%. I can&rsquo;t even imagine his efficiency in 2024. Adding in these factors, he very well could&rsquo;ve been even better today, despite some people clowning on him for his 1st team selection. Imagine Luka&rsquo;s current lob-threat targets in Lively, DJJ, and Gafford, but bigger, stronger, more athletic, and even more efficient. You transport prime CP3 and DJ into 2024 and they wreak absolute havoc.</p>

<p>Like sure, Gobert or Wemby are more impactful defensively because of their size, but there are perimeter guys who standout from the rest of the perimeter defenders and they should be credited just as much as the centers who standout.</p>

<p>Defensive players certainly have roles as do offensive players, but in a switch happy league all guys need to be able to do a bit of everything. I think there is a similar amount of differentiation of roles on both offense and defense</p>

<p>Like I would say McDaniels stands out a lot from all the other small forwards compared to how much Wemby stands out from the centers when Gobert is even better or equally as good.</p>

<p>Same for Bam and Davis. If both of them are that good, neither stands out. For me, this year&rsquo;s all defense should&rsquo;ve been one of the Celtics guards as PG, Herb, McDaniels, Davis and Gobert.</p>

Then why don&rsquo;t more teams play a three towers lineup? It&rsquo;s pretty common to have a third rotation big. Because big men are terrible at perimeter defense, which is insanely hard and very important to winning. It&rsquo;s just a lot harder to assign individual credit for it than for rim protection.</p>

<p>A far better and much more elegant solution, at least in my opinion, would&rsquo;ve been to simply introduce a new type of award. This way the format could&rsquo;ve been anything, even a straight up list of pick-a-number best players in the world. It would&rsquo;ve also allowed the league to make it a full-season award. Last but not least, it wouldn&rsquo;t have messed with NBA history the way the current all-NBA format does.</p>

<p>It really depends on the player&rsquo;s skillset though, just like basketball. Like your example, most 1B are slower and probably can&rsquo;t play many other positions. Shortstop and Centerfield are usually only played by the best defensive infielders and outfielders on the team. 1B needs to be at least somewhat tall, 3B needs to have a good arm, etc., but a lot of guys can play multiple positions.</p>

Its hard enough to identify who the best defenders are because of the lack of statistical measures, but making it positionless basically makes it a block competition. There&rsquo;s a lot more to defense than rim defense. Wing defenders are just as important, but they get no attention because they aren&rsquo;t front and center. So you&rsquo;ll never see one even make all defense.</p>

      <label for="l6wprr9" class="commentText"><p>I think the All-Defense team was a bit of unintended consequence.  Voters clearly still wanted to get guards in there, and they basically just decided to give 1st team to the bigs and 2nd team to the smalls.  That wasn&rsquo;t really the idea.</p>

<p>But I do think positionless has a lot of merit elsewhere.  Like the difference between an SG and a SF (and often even PF) is negligible in today&rsquo;s league - they&rsquo;re all just wings - yet voters were being forced to jam a wing in at either Guard or Forward.</p>

<p>Personally I&rsquo;d do the awards positionless but force the voters to vote  by position (just frontcourt and backcourt is fine).  So like if Jaylen Brown gets 30 votes at backcourt and 50 votes at frontcourt, it just counts as 80 votes.  I think this will create more honest teams while also allowing some flexibilty.</p>

      <label for="l6wvlyu" class="commentText"><p>Nope i really dislike. Basketball isn&rsquo;t played without positions so why should the awards be positionless? Sometimes Embiid will be on the second team because there are too many good centers and sometimes DeAndre Jordan will make all-nba because there aren&rsquo;t enough good centers. But it&rsquo;s still an accurate depiction of that particular season. Atleast make it FC/BC if you really wanted to reduce the impact of positions. Right now, there is no difference between first team and the top 5 MVP voting.</p>

      <label for="l6xihje" class="commentText"><p>There are really 3 positions in modern basketball: center, point guard (ball handler/playmaker), and wing. Defensively, there are really only 2: center and everyone else. The easiest to grade defensively are centers as they have a more limited role and their impact is way more easily measured. Theoretically, the best perimeter defender would force the ball out of his man&rsquo;s hands 100% of the time and never have to contest a shot which is incredibly hard to measure. So I can somewhat understand why C&rsquo;s would dominate the All-Defense list, though I don&rsquo;t agree with it. For All NBA selection, I prefer no position preference.</p>

<p>First, in the era of positionless basketball, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to categorize by position.</p>

      <label for="l6ydaq1" class="commentText"><p>Don&rsquo;t like it, but the original mistake was allowing all-NBA to be an incentive for supermax contracts. Once the NBA changed that, anything other than positionless was unfair. I&rsquo;d like to see all of that rolled back.</p>

<p>But within the current system, I think the approach should have been that first-team is still positional, so that we get an actual sensible first team for both all-NBA and all-defense, and then second/third teams can be positionless, most points amongst all who didn&rsquo;t make first team.</p>

<p>Besides, that reflects the nature of teams&hellip; the starters (first team) usually reflects clear positions, but the bench (second/third teams) rarely is balanced equally amongst positions.</p>

      <label for="l6ys5ri" class="commentText"><p>No. The point of the “teams” is to recognise the best players at each position, and that was a good thing. If you want a list of the best defenders, look at DPOY voting or just make it a list. But I think that the best defensive PG, SG, etc. deserves recognition, because that is an achievement in and of itself and also represents them taking on different responsibilities than a Center. Same goes for All-NBA. </p>

The issue comes when people use it to determine the actual skill of a player, because the 2nd best player in the League could be 2nd team simply because he’s the 2nd best Center as well. (AKA, Embiid)</p>

<p>If you keep it positionless, then it’s no longer the All-NBA Team, at that point, just make it a Top (x amount of players) List. (Which is fine)</p>

<p>I think it should be positioned, as long as people stop using it for their shitty rankings or trying to elevate one player over another</p>

And today&rsquo;s game has evolved past traditional positions too much. Many power forwards frequently slide to the 5 for small ball lineups, how do you classify those? Some teams play three guard lineups, which of those do you then declare the small forward? It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to try to press the game into this rigid structure anymore.</p>

<p>NBA got rid of it because Embiid and Morey are big cry babies and didn’t want to be stuck behind Jokic.  Which was a dumb move. He wasn’t the first amazing guy to get stuck in the second team because there was somebody better</p>
