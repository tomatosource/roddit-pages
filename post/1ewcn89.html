      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ewcn89/why_are_nba_role_players_or_coaches_who_worked/"><p>Why are NBA role players or coaches who worked their way up from smaller roles within an organization more successful as NBA head coaches than NBA stars?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Some of the top current coaches in the league like Spo, Pop, Lue, Kerr, Malone, Daigneault, Finch, Thibs, Nurse, Carlisle, etc. have seen success to varying degrees in the NBA with their coaching style that has proven to work in different situations.</p>

<p>A lot of those guys were role players in the NBA before becoming head coaches or worked their way up from being video coordinators to assistant to eventually head coaches like Spo for example.</p>

<p>I’m just curious as to why players who have been superstars and stars in their career haven’t been as successful as the aforementioned group.</p>

<p>Someone like Jason Kidd for example is forging a path for the star group of coaches which is nice to see as his basketball mind should be able to translate to coaching.</p>

<p>But for every Jason Kidd, Jerry West, and Bill Russell there’s a Steve Nash, Isiah Thomas and Elgin Baylor who were elite players and basketball minds but just couldn’t become successful NBA head coaches.</p>

      <label for="lixrtf1" class="commentText"><p>As the other comment says, there are way more role players and assistants out there than there have been stars who went on to coach in league history.</p>

<p>Of the guys who are on the Top 75 list, these are the only ones who went on to be the head coach of a NBA team: Elgin Baylor (Jazz), Larry Bird (Pacers who made the Finals), Bob Cousy (Royals/Kings), Dave Cowens (Celtics, Hornets, Warriors), Billy Cunningham (Sixers who won the championship), Dave DeBusschere (Pistons), Magic Johnson (Lakers), Kevin McHale (Wolves,Rockets), George Mikan (Lakers), Steve Nash (Nets), Willis Reed (Knicks, Nets), Bill Russell (Celtics, Sonics, Kings), Dolph Schayes (Sixers, Braves), Bill Sharman (Warriors, Lakers), Isiah Thomas (Pacers, Knicks), Wes Unseld (Bullets), Jerry West (Lakers) and Lenny Wilkens (too many to name but won in 1979 as coach of the Sonics and listed as a Top 15 Coach of all time).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just not a lot to compare to the smaller guys who get gigs as a head coach and just end up successful because they&rsquo;re very good at it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also guess that as a former role player you would know how to instruct and motivate other role players since how those guys play is a huge part of coaching compared to a former star who may only know how to relate to other stars.</p>

      <label for="lixqswo" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s definitely the issue of just way more non-stars. But I also think there&rsquo;s an issue with a lot of stars that&rsquo;s its a bit hard for them to relate to non elite talent. Imagine Shaq as a coach telling all his players to simply dunk on everyone. That&rsquo;s obviously a cartoon version of the issue, but with a lot of those guys, their path is just not one that&rsquo;s going to work for other people.</p>

      <label for="lixw77s" class="commentText"><p>The guys who came up the ranks usually had to prove they could coach BEFORE they got the job.  Most NBA stars are getting the job on name recognition and playing accolades.  Kidd, for example, is solid now, but he was awful in previous HC stops and had to spend a few years as an AC working on the craft.  Luka being good enough to make any coach look semi-competent also helps.</p>

<p>I also think when some stars realize that coaching requires a different skill set that they&rsquo;ll need to grind at just to maybe be average, they lose interest (Nash was basically begging to be fired by the end of his tenure).  It takes astronomical dedication to become an NBA star and I imagine exceedingly few people have the dedication to turn around and become an elite coach too.</p>

      <label for="liymhuv" class="commentText"><p>This happens in soccer too. Some people have said its because the star player will not be able to comprehend the limits that the average player has.</p>

<p>For example, they will think oh just do the pick and roll and you should be able to make the correct read 90% of the time which should always create an advantage for the team, which then leaves someone wide open. But in reality, the large majority of players cannot make the correct read fast enough or with that level of accuracy and so there things start to fall apart. They take their abilities for granted and are not easily able to adapt their understanding of the game to the players they are coaching.</p>

<p>Someone had said this about zidane when he tried coaching, he was doing a drill and his players kept fucking up and he was like “just make this pass” and turned and proceeded to make some world class level pass across the field. Then the players try to redo the drill and make the pass but they just simply aren’t good enough. So even tho zidane has an amazing understanding of the game and was making the correct read, it just wasnt applicable to his team and thus he couldnt figure out how to coach them to success if they couldnt do what he knew to do.</p>
