Whenever he came over and we went out, he had to duck several inches to walk through every single door he went through.</p>

<p>I understand that being a literal millionaire athlete soothes most problems, but it has to be extremely frustrating having to deal with annoyances like that every single day that most people haven‚Äôt ever considered once. The world is not built for people over 6‚Äô6.</p>

<p>I never played w him, but my best friend had to guard him in an AAU game one summer and got torched and my best friend was like MJ compared to me so that was eye opening</p>

<p>During pickup games, he&rsquo;d play 3 and D one game, drive and dish the next, then score and rebound like a madman in the one thereafter. Honing his craft in real time, no one could touch the dude. Raymond Felton.</p>

<p>That said, I havent played against or had more than a 30 second interaction with someone who had that unbelievable a skill set. People in my hometown knew a young Zion but he wasn&rsquo;t that big a deal yet.</p>

<p>Point is, its eye opening at just how goddamned talented you have to ne to make the league when the best player I&rsquo;d encountered was a fringe all star.</p>

      <label for="lnc9q9i" class="commentText"><p>I worked at a middle school with an eventual nba player. The high school basketball coach would rib him in the halls and was absolutely giddy to know he was getting him the next year. I think it‚Äôs the only reason the coach stuck around to be honest. Current team sucked and they were just terrible. Anyway come next fall the kid is going to a prep academy with a bunch of other blue chippers and the coach is fucked lol. Good kid. He had a very successful NCAA stint and a respectable NBA career. Nothing out of this world but he was a bench guy that stuck in the league for a long time.</p>

I was told that when they travelled or if Blake ever spent the night , Blake would wake up on his own and do  these intense stretching exercises  every morning. Apparently his father made him do it since he was super young.</p>

We were not friends but I got to play a few basketball and baseball games with him, he was clearly better than everyone else in both sports.

      <label for="lncfxv5" class="commentText"><p>I went to high school with Jaylin Williams and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about him. Just a stand up guy, really funny, great to be around, extremely hard worker. There‚Äôs probably nobody who ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù to succeed more. I also went to school with Isaiah Joe, but he was older and I didn‚Äôt really know him at all. He also had a really insane growth spurt. One year we‚Äôre the same height, next year I‚Äôm looking up to him. I can‚Äôt remember if that was late middle school or early high school though.</p>

      <label for="lncg474" class="commentText"><p>I went to high school with JuJuan Johnson, Purdue Star and former Boston Celtic for one season. He&rsquo;s been playing overseas for a long time. I was a senior when he was a freshman. I never met him but would see him in the halls some time, far and away the tallest person in the school. The junior basketball team photo in the yearbook is very funny, he dwarfs everyone in the photo despite being like 14 or 15.</p>

<p>Bonus: there&rsquo;s also a picture from a game my school played against Lawrence North, aka the high school Greg Oden and Mike Conley went to. The picture is of Oden guarding one of the players from my school&rsquo;s team that I always thought was cool.</p>
