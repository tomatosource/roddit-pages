<p>We would win more often than not. Then one summer we went to go over there, and Greg was like a foot and a half taller. And we never won again üòÇ</p>

It was all like ‚Äúin high school he actually didn‚Äôt make varsity his first year and he was not happy with that. He worked his ass off that summer every single day working fundamentals. And he also grew a foot and a half. Made varsity next year‚Äù üòÇü§£</p>

      <label for="lnd2bla" class="commentText"><p>I thought Scottie didn‚Äôt get that growth spurt until college.  Or maybe that was Rodman?</p>

<p>Edit:  just looked it up.  Pippen was 6‚Äô1‚Äù when he finished high school and then had a growth spurt later, which partly explains why he was low level college.</p>

<p>Unless he was maybe 4‚Äô5‚Äù when he started high school, I don‚Äôt think he had a big growth spurt in high school.</p>

His dad was a little strict and pushed him kinda hard on and off the court and had him in church on the regular. That influence resulted in strong work ethic, professionalism and smart money management though.</p>

<p>During pickup games, he&rsquo;d play 3 and D one game, drive and dish the next, then score and rebound like a madman in the one thereafter. Honing his craft in real time, no one could touch the dude. Raymond Felton.</p>

      <label for="lnchawf" class="commentText"><p>Yeah those Portland years were a little off kilter. Not sure if it was conditioning, injury, burnout or homesickness. I personally have not spoken to the dude in years so I can&rsquo;t speculate.</p>

<p>That said, I havent played against or had more than a 30 second interaction with someone who had that unbelievable a skill set. People in my hometown knew a young Zion but he wasn&rsquo;t that big a deal yet.</p>

<p>Point is, its eye opening at just how goddamned talented you have to ne to make the league when the best player I&rsquo;d encountered was a fringe all star.</p>

      <label for="lncsdh3" class="commentText"><p>I had classes with Marcus Smart in highschool. He was funny and polite for the most part but would also act up like mooning someone when the teacher turned away kinda shit. Once in algebra II our running back  Rufus was reading a Kobe biography which caused Marcus and him to have the GOAT argument. Rufus was arguing Kobe and Marcus was saying Lebron is better (this would have been 2012 or 2013). I always think about that moment when I see Marcus guarding Lebron on tv. He won us 2 state championships too which was fun.</p>

<p>Edit: Was probably 2010 or 2011 thinking back on the year we graduated so this was before lebron had even won one</p>

      <label for="lndqa0j" class="commentText"><p>I went to school at university of Oregon in 2008. I&rsquo;m pretty tall, have curly hair and played basketball a lot. I used to always get called chase budinger by the UofO football players. The football team was always down at the rec playing basketball and they dominated us normies. Specifically, I played with Lamichael James and Kenyon barner. Barner was seriously like kemba walker there and lamichael was oddly average.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget how bad at basketball Patrick Chung was. He was a dB for uo around that time and was the most uncoordinated motherfucker I&rsquo;ve ever seen. He would get steals and have a wide open layup and, when you&rsquo;d assume he&rsquo;d dunk it, he&rsquo;d doink it off the backboard with as much finesse as a rhino. He was always the most athletic person on the court, but literally the worst basketball player ever. It was hilarious.</p>

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>

      <label for="lncmh5o" class="commentText"><p>I spent one semester at KU in the middle of college, even though I graduated from somewhere else, and I ate lunch solo most of the time because I didn‚Äôt have much time to set up a friend network, and one time the Morris twins sat down with me (before Marcus was a PotY candidate) with someone else in their crew who wasn‚Äôt on the team because all the other tables were full and they chatted me up. Pretty nice guys in my experience, though I know they‚Äôve made their share of mistakes. I‚Äôd see them around after that and they‚Äôd nod at me if we passed each other.</p>

I was told that when they travelled or if Blake ever spent the night , Blake would wake up on his own and do  these intense stretching exercises  every morning. Apparently his father made him do it since he was super young.</p>

<p>We were watching the NCAA tournament and he said he‚Äôll join us for the evening skate of games. Later that night he stopped by and asked my friend if he has a rubber, and we didn‚Äôt see him the rest of the night lmao</p>

<p>During move out week we found a pair of size 16 sneakers outside our door, thought it was a parting gift so my roommate and I split the pair as souvenirs. Later that day Tim walks past and asks why do we have his shoes. Told him the story and he had a good laugh but insists that we can‚Äôt have those shoes.</p>

<p>Til this day my friend says for good or bad his NBA career was made because of the condom he gave Tim that day.</p>

<p>He was a kid, pretty standard as far as that. He played the exact same way but drove a lot more. Never jumpshots, incredible court vision and just bigger and faster than everybody else. His dad Dave tried to teach me how to shoot accurately while making distance and I remember feeling like he was messing up my shot. I was a better shooter than his Dave too.</p>

      <label for="lnc9q9i" class="commentText"><p>I worked at a middle school with an eventual nba player. The high school basketball coach would rib him in the halls and was absolutely giddy to know he was getting him the next year. I think it‚Äôs the only reason the coach stuck around to be honest. Current team sucked and they were just terrible. Anyway come next fall the kid is going to a prep academy with a bunch of other blue chippers and the coach is fucked lol. Good kid. He had a very successful NCAA stint and a respectable NBA career. Nothing out of this world but he was a bench guy that stuck in the league for a long time.</p>

      <label for="lncpim9" class="commentText"><p>no NBA players, but I did go to school with a future NFL player, who was a good starting TE in the early 2010&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He was extremely charismatic and by all accounts a good dude but physically just one of the most imposing people I&rsquo;ve ever been around.  Our high school was very crowded but the hallways parted like the red sea when he walked through.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve run across a couple of college stars and future NBA players as an adult as well, and it was mostly the same thing.  I&rsquo;m a very tall person, 6&rsquo;7&rdquo; in bare feet, but despite being taller than many of them, they exude athleticism in a way that makes you feel smaller than you are.</p>

Just a stand up guy, really funny, great to be around, extremely hard worker. There‚Äôs probably nobody who ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù to succeed more. I also went to school with Isaiah Joe, but he was older and I didn‚Äôt really know him at all. He also had a really insane growth spurt. One year we‚Äôre the same height, next year I‚Äôm looking up to him. I can‚Äôt remember if that was late middle school or early high school though.</p>

      <label for="lncg474" class="commentText"><p>I went to high school with JuJuan Johnson, Purdue Star and former Boston Celtic for one season. He&rsquo;s been playing overseas for a long time. I was a senior when he was a freshman. I never met him but would see him in the halls some time, far and away the tallest person in the school. The junior basketball team photo in the yearbook is very funny, he dwarfs everyone in the photo despite being like 14 or 15.</p>

<p>Bonus: there&rsquo;s also a picture from a game my school played against Lawrence North, aka the high school Greg Oden and Mike Conley went to. The picture is of Oden guarding one of the players from my school&rsquo;s team that I always thought was cool.</p>
