<p>We would win more often than not. Then one summer we went to go over there, and Greg was like a foot and a half taller. And we never won again 😂</p>

      <label for="lncdnj4" class="commentText"><p>Can attest. Went to Indiana with Cody Zeller, my roommate was a student manager for the men’s bb team and was friends with Cody. Whenever he came over and we went out, he had to duck several inches to walk through every single door he went through.</p>

<p>I understand that being a literal millionaire athlete soothes most problems, but it has to be extremely frustrating having to deal with annoyances like that every single day that most people haven’t ever considered once. The world is not built for people over 6’6.</p>

      <label for="lncqdwr" class="commentText"><p>Arkansas had a 7 footer named Steven Hill who would go out to Dickson street just like the other college kids. There was one bar where everyone ended the night and you&rsquo;d always see him there a foot above the crowd just standing there like he was afraid to dance because everyone could see him. There&rsquo;s no hiding the dance moves when they&rsquo;re that high. You&rsquo;ve got all those daily annoyances due to size and you&rsquo;re always the most visible person</p>

His dad was a little strict and pushed him kinda hard on and off the court and had him in church on the regular. That influence resulted in strong work ethic, professionalism and smart money management though.</p>

<p>During pickup games, he&rsquo;d play 3 and D one game, drive and dish the next, then score and rebound like a madman in the one thereafter. Honing his craft in real time, no one could touch the dude. Raymond Felton.</p>

<p>That said, I havent played against or had more than a 30 second interaction with someone who had that unbelievable a skill set. People in my hometown knew a young Zion but he wasn&rsquo;t that big a deal yet.</p>

<p>Point is, its eye opening at just how goddamned talented you have to ne to make the league when the best player I&rsquo;d encountered was a fringe all star.</p>

      <label for="lncomfe" class="commentText"><p>I saw Steve Blake at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>

Pretty nice guys in my experience, though I know they’ve made their share of mistakes. I’d see them around after that and they’d nod at me if we passed each other.</p>

      <label for="lncsdh3" class="commentText"><p>I had classes with Marcus Smart in highschool. He was funny and polite for the most part but would also act up like mooning someone when the teacher turned away kinda shit. Once in algebra II our running back  Rufus was reading a Kobe biography which caused Marcus and him to have the GOAT argument. Rufus was arguing Kobe and Marcus was saying Lebron is better (this would have been 2012 or 2013). I always think about that moment when I see Marcus guarding Lebron on tv. He won us 2 state championships too which was fun.</p>

<p>Edit: Was probably 2010 or 2011 thinking back on the year we graduated so this was before lebron had even won one</p>

The high school basketball coach would rib him in the halls and was absolutely giddy to know he was getting him the next year. I think it’s the only reason the coach stuck around to be honest. Current team sucked and they were just terrible. Anyway come next fall the kid is going to a prep academy with a bunch of other blue chippers and the coach is fucked lol. Good kid. He had a very successful NCAA stint and a respectable NBA career. Nothing out of this world but he was a bench guy that stuck in the league for a long time.</p>

I was a senior when he was a freshman. I never met him but would see him in the halls some time, far and away the tallest person in the school. The junior basketball team photo in the yearbook is very funny, he dwarfs everyone in the photo despite being like 14 or 15.</p>

<p>Bonus: there&rsquo;s also a picture from a game my school played against Lawrence North, aka the high school Greg Oden and Mike Conley went to. The picture is of Oden guarding one of the players from my school&rsquo;s team that I always thought was cool.</p>

Just a stand up guy, really funny, great to be around, extremely hard worker. There’s probably nobody who “deserves” to succeed more. I also went to school with Isaiah Joe, but he was older and I didn’t really know him at all. He also had a really insane growth spurt. One year we’re the same height, next year I’m looking up to him. I can’t remember if that was late middle school or early high school though.</p>

<p>I played little league with Joe Saunders. Most of us spent our concession stand ticket on big league chew, but he did the thing where he got soda and then mixed all of the flavors. We both played catcher. He made all stars, but I thought I was better than him because I was good at recovering pass balls and then tagging out the kid that tried to steal home. I don’t remember ever seeing Joe do that</p>

<p>My sister went to high school with Kara Lawson. She never saw her outside of practice. She was also terrified because she thought playing against her was physically dangerous.</p>

      <label for="lncp280" class="commentText"><p>I occasionally hang out with multiple NBA players .. Mostly Former   only 2 are currently in the league.  For the most part they are just regular people with soooooooo much time on their hands. The only person that I have been around that in real life and game life is the same is Kenyon Martin. I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; so I am not intimidated by taller people. But Kenyon was just intimidating and funny  in real life and dude loves Corona beer. Zibo  was surprisingly super extra nice just hood. Been around a lot of athletes and most of them are just cool people oh except D Book he is an ass hole in real life.</p>

      <label for="lncpim9" class="commentText"><p>no NBA players, but I did go to school with a future NFL player, who was a good starting TE in the early 2010&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He was extremely charismatic and by all accounts a good dude but physically just one of the most imposing people I&rsquo;ve ever been around.  Our high school was very crowded but the hallways parted like the red sea when he walked through.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve run across a couple of college stars and future NBA players as an adult as well, and it was mostly the same thing.  I&rsquo;m a very tall person, 6&rsquo;7&rdquo; in bare feet, but despite being taller than many of them, they exude athleticism in a way that makes you feel smaller than you are.</p>

He was a really chill dude kinda similar to how he is now honestly. He’s kind of like KD in terms of personality as well he just chilled &amp; got buckets. Our team routinely beat his team but he always balled out tough. Dude is also obviously tall as shit.</p>

Rondae on the other hand sat in the 2nd row, participated, and was funny. I wouldn’t say he was a class clown but he would participate, make jokes, and was generally fun to be around.</p>

<p>My friend was childhood friends with Frank Kaminsky, which was hard because we were both students at UofA when Wisconsin did the double on AZ. He had pictures with him as kids and had his cell number saved. Frank was a goofy kid apparently.</p>
