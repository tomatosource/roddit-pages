      <p>I think the general consensus is that Damian Lillard stayed on the Blazers longer than he should&rsquo;ve because he&rsquo;s now old and injury prone. When should he have left, and what teams could&rsquo;ve gotten him?</p>

He was averaging like 16 for Toronto and then immediately jumped to 27 with the Nets, and I think everyone knew that was going to happen. He was done with Toronto.</p>

      <label for="ln3evxp" class="commentText"><p>I was tracking Carter&rsquo;s performance back then. He wasn&rsquo;t doing well with the Nets early on and I thought he was done as an elite player and I wasn&rsquo;t the only one. Here are the per 36 numbers:</p>

<p>With the Raptors: 19.9 points per game, 4.1 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 2.6 stocks. 32.2% from 3s, 69% FT</p>

<p>With the Nets (first 15 games): 20.9 points per game, 5.3 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.4 stocks 36.5% from 3s, 72% FT</p>

<p>With the Nets (after the first 15 games) 29.6 points per game, 6 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 2.2 stocks 44% from 3s, 84% FT</p>

<p>I think it was a simple case of trading a frustrated player who was still working into shape coming off an injury. His quickness was visibly inconsistent and his shooting was obviously off. Carter himself mentioned his legs just weren&rsquo;t there early in the season.</p>

      <label for="ln4y411" class="commentText"><p>The ironic part is when Vince Carter gave the infamous interview of him not pushing it hard with Toronto, he had not been all that amazing with the Nets like the numbers above show and the feeling was the season was done for in New Jersey. There were even a lot of concerns around the Nets team that Vince Carter was washed and Jason Kidd would get traded. Then the Nets were able to turn it around with Jefferson getting injured and Carter coming back to his old self.</p>

<p>Later Carter said he was misunderstood and not pushing it hard referred to injuries and it didn&rsquo;t even make sense for a player not to play hard in that position. But that along with his first month with the Nets were all forgotten and forever Vince Carter would be known as the player who suddenly went from a chump to a champ because he hated his former team.</p>

<p>Because I was tracking Carter&rsquo;s numbers with the Nets after the trade it was really fascinating how quickly a new narrative formed. It didn&rsquo;t help that Carter was clearly still feeling unhappy with the Raptors front office and wasn&rsquo;t choosing his words wisely and guys like Bill Simmons bought heavily into the new narrative after Carter began to play well.</p>

      <label for="ln1038s" class="commentText"><p>I agree. I love him for the loyalty, but everyone with all star talent should have followed LBJ when he moved from the Cavs the first time. It doesn&rsquo;t always work out as we have seen, but I think that comes down to a lot of the FO not really understanding what their coaches can do and the mix of egos. The best teams we see are at least 2-3 stars with 2 arguably starter role players and a sixth man that also could start, finally with a decent bench that buys into their own roles</p>

LeBron is at worst, the 2nd best player of all time, but even he needed other great players to win. Dame at his best, was about the 8th-9th best player in the league. You gotta acknowledge that you need to be the 1B guy to win with that caliber, which he took way too long to do.</p>

Theres a lot of money in being a winning franchise for a reason, and that&rsquo;s because it comes with a huge boost in ticket and merchandise sales, higher viewership, and more fans overall. On the flip side, if you suck all those things will go down.</p>

<p>At a certain point, if a player can&rsquo;t deliver, the fan base turns on them.  There&rsquo;s always a limit.  If Steph decided to stick around another 25 years and doom GSW to paying him a supermax at 60 you can bet your ass they&rsquo;d turn on him too.</p>

<p>If Dame had stuck around another 5 years taking a max contract and missing the playoffs every year, blazers fans would not be nearly as loyal as you&rsquo;re making them out to be.</p>

      <label for="ln0z575" class="commentText"><p>The man got used to being the bucket they needed. I believe it is incredibly hard to find rhythm as a shooter without volume to go with it. KD on the warriors is a somewhat recent example of having crazy efficiency with low volume. Maybe someone else can find another example, but it is rare.</p>

<p>He is now in a position where he should shoot half of not more then half the shots he has taken over his career. That would be really hard to adjust to</p>

      <label for="ln12r77" class="commentText"><p>If you look at KD&rsquo;s tenure across all the teams he&rsquo;s played on he averaged the lowest MPG and FGA on the Warriors. I don&rsquo;t understand why you think they ran him to the ground outside of that 1 incident in 2019 Finals which his own doctors cleared him to play. His time on the Warriors was probably the easiest for him in his career since he is playing along side Curry/Draymond/Klay and doesn&rsquo;t have to do as much.</p>

<p>EDIT: It&rsquo;s crazy that this is an unpopular take when its literally statistics. He averaged less min and FGA during the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/vWglUmH" target="_blank">regular season</a> and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Sfu5ZOT" target="_blank">playoffs</a> if you just look at his averages across all his teams at the bottom.</p>

      <label for="ln1w9kh" class="commentText"><p>Except putting up the same amount of FGA in less minutes cancels some of that out and the injury happened. Like people can do mental gymnastics about him averaging 2 less minutes a game but I saw what I saw. They overly-relied on him and ran him into the ground. It’s not just pure coincidence that his significant injury of his career happened during that playoff run.</p>

      <label for="ln1mj30" class="commentText"><p>I would kinda agree, except the narrative had been that he should leave PDX basically since 2016. Or maybe not the narrative, but PDX is kinda like Charlotte and Sacramento in that theyre looked down on even in up years. The loyalty talk was born out of persistent &ldquo;he&rsquo;s doomed there&rdquo; talk for just as long. It admittedly spiraled, but he was fighting to put rumors belittling his teammates away literally every season after LA left in 2015, INCLUDING 2019. There wasnt one year post LA that I can remember where national fans thought Dame was doing right by his career. Loyalty was nearly the only alibi. That or actually leave asap</p>

<p>sports too fickle, primes too short, patience too short, other players too good, too much money </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet in football, a decidedly more physical sport, loyalty and legacy reign supreme.  How long did Montana play for the 49ers?  How long did Aikman play for the Cowboys?  How long did Favre play for the Packers, and how big of a controversy was it when he went to Minnesota?  How long did Brady play for New England, and how big of a controversy was it when he went to Tampa?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same with baseball.  The big names were loyal.  Old school you have Babe, DiMagio, Cobb, Aaron, but even in the modern era how long did Ichiro play for Seattle?</p>

<p>Basketball is the only one of the major sports where individual player success is seen as bigger and more important than team success.  The attitude of &ldquo;What have you done for me today&rdquo; is prevalent in the NBA.  Ring chasing.  I don&rsquo;t think it does the league well.</p>

<p>And it sure as hell isn&rsquo;t about the money.  How much did A Rod get playing for the Yankees?</p>

During the season, half the posts in our subreddit are still about Dame. His first game back in Portland last season pretty much drowned out the hardcore naysaying fans. It wasn&rsquo;t the cleanest divorce when he left, but after it was over, the overwhelming majority of the fan base got over it.</p>

Trading CJ can&rsquo;t solve both those problems, but trading Dame would have.</p>

      <label for="ln0y5a6" class="commentText"><p>The 2018 playoffs exposed the fundamental flaw in the construction of the Portland team, they never really rebuilt the front court after LA and Lopez left because Dam made their tanking not work and a backcourt of CJ and Dam was not going to work the way a pre-injury Matthews and Dam was going to work, so at that point basically the entire team needed to get blown up and rebuilt around Lillard&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses for real (which would have meant eating a few bad years for real) or he needed to sign off them taking some real gambles but instead everyone, including Lillard liked that team and doubled down and they ended up making the WCF the next year which basically is when they peaked as constructed. From there, injuries and regressing to the mean caught up with everyone, so either Lillard needed to bail or eat some true rebuilds like the team never really did early in his career</p>

Gave everything he had and couldn&rsquo;t even beat Jokic and friends (not on him at all) Prolly should&rsquo;ve left after he got swept by GS in 19 but 2021 felt realistic. I think that was the perfect window for Dame to force his way to Miami like he always wanted to do initially. That 2022 heat team that was a 1 seed and a Jimmy shot away from the finals definitely would&rsquo;ve represented the East that year and possibly could beat Golden State.</p>

<p>Probably after the shortened 2020-21 season. They were a slightly above average team thanks to him, but got bounced in the first round and looked like a team that reached its ceiling.</p>

Dame was just never as elite as guys like Steph, LeBron, KD, Kawhi and Giannis so couldn&rsquo;t get over the hump. I&rsquo;d put him below Harden as well, who also hasn&rsquo;t gotten a title.</p>

<p>A team absolutely could have won a title with Lillard, but they would have needed to be very good outside of him like what you saw with the Celtics this year.</p>

His role carrying Portland was fine, and once he hit 5-6 years should have just stayed his whole career. Surrounding him with other good players at this point in his game is going to kill his playing time and impact. Different playstyle, but a similar career trajectory to Dominique Wilkins</p>
