    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’m struggling to figure out where he ends up, most teams no longer have cap space and the few that do you wouldn’t think want to spend it on a guy like tyus</p>

<p>Ill list a few of my ideal landing spots</p>

<p>Suns: if they can somehow convince him to sign on a min for a year, doubt it but I think that’s the only way since they can’t sign and trade iirc</p>

<p>Jazz: just grab him if nobody else does and offer him a cheap contract, then move him at the deadline</p>

<p>Magic: via sign and trade, probably for Cole Anthony since I think he’s the only player that would match theoretical tyus salary and they could afford to lose, not sure what this does for the wizards, maybe magic attach a couple seconds? Maybe wizards thing Cole has a higher ceiling and could put up numbers for them? Not totally sure</p>

Noone is willing to do that. Now he is in a limbo where teams that can use him can&rsquo;t offer much money (minimum or a bit above it) and the teams that can offer money don&rsquo;t want him.</p>

<p>You would’ve signed him if you didn’t sign KCP, I don’t see how that’s really relevant, you still lack real point guard play on the roster, Anthony is a pure scorer and Suggs is a limited playmaker and is probably better served off ball, tyus off the bench would be amazing for the magic</p>

<p>Also why are you saying “ew”? Why would you be so defiant against upgrading Cole to Tyus? Jones fits better and is a better player, I feel like that’s homerism</p>

      <label for="lf19f9d" class="commentText"><p>We never had any interest in Tyus Jones. Swapping one undersized guard for another is not a move we’re looking into. We ran a no pg lineup last season and are going to continue that given the KCP signing. Saying we would have signed him if we didn’t sign KCP is completely baseless. We literally just signed old ass Corey Joseph to our last roster spot. If we wanted Tyus we could have signed him at any point. “Ew” because it is both a terrible trade idea and also doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p>I don’t know why you’re pushing to hard against this, it’s boils down to the Magic’s offense was awful and tyus is a significantly better playmaker and a more efficient scorer than Cole, it’s just an upgrade</p>

<p>Our offense was bad because we had no three point shooting, hence KCP. And our Cole Anthony lead bench was fourth in the league in scoring, he’s not the problem there. Just admit you don’t know what you’re talking about, it’s not that big of a deal.</p>

      <label for="lf16x4r" class="commentText"><p>Yeah they’d be good too, gives them dlo insurance too if they decide to move him</p>

<p>Not sure who the sign and trade would be, feel like they’d have to attach a pick to Vincent or something</p>

      <label for="lf1c3bk" class="commentText"><p>I definitely see the Jazz as an option, there is absolutely no need to rush Collier&rsquo;s development, and having two inexperienced guards guiding your team at PG is not the best way to develop the rest of your young players. Tyus could either start or come off the bench, and he would be a trade asset down the line.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t see Phoenix as an option, think there&rsquo;s a real shot with the Lakers. Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised there. Don&rsquo;t see Orlando as an option&hellip;they wanna play Black. Fultz was allowed to walk to play Black more. Clippers are said to be out on Tyus.</p>

<p>Depending on the salary, Kings are an option to watch for Tyus. Detroit, Cleveland, Charlotte are teams to watch. Knicks are not 100% out on Tyus either IMO, although they&rsquo;re a real long shot with the showing Kolek had during summer league. Think they&rsquo;re comfortable now with their PG rotation, so they&rsquo;re an unlikely option.</p>

      <label for="lf1fncp" class="commentText"><p>I would be happy if the Pistons signed him on a fair value contract.  The team is missing a guy who can do what he does.  I thought he was going to be one of their primary targets in the offseason but they largely just went for veteran wings instead.</p>
