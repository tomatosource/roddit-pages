    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’m struggling to figure out where he ends up, most teams no longer have cap space and the few that do you wouldn’t think want to spend it on a guy like tyus</p>

<p>Ill list a few of my ideal landing spots</p>

<p>Suns: if they can somehow convince him to sign on a min for a year, doubt it but I think that’s the only way since they can’t sign and trade iirc</p>

<p>Jazz: just grab him if nobody else does and offer him a cheap contract, then move him at the deadline</p>

<p>Magic: via sign and trade, probably for Cole Anthony since I think he’s the only player that would match theoretical tyus salary and they could afford to lose, not sure what this does for the wizards, maybe magic attach a couple seconds? Maybe wizards thing Cole has a higher ceiling and could put up numbers for them? Not totally sure</p>

Noone is willing to do that. Now he is in a limbo where teams that can use him can&rsquo;t offer much money (minimum or a bit above it) and the teams that can offer money don&rsquo;t want him.</p>

<p>You would’ve signed him if you didn’t sign KCP, I don’t see how that’s really relevant, you still lack real point guard play on the roster, Anthony is a pure scorer and Suggs is a limited playmaker and is probably better served off ball, tyus off the bench would be amazing for the magic</p>

<p>Also why are you saying “ew”? Why would you be so defiant against upgrading Cole to Tyus? Jones fits better and is a better player, I feel like that’s homerism</p>

We ran a no pg lineup last season and are going to continue that given the KCP signing. Saying we would have signed him if we didn’t sign KCP is completely baseless. We literally just signed old ass Corey Joseph to our last roster spot. If we wanted Tyus we could have signed him at any point. “Ew” because it is both a terrible trade idea and also doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p>I don’t know why you’re pushing to hard against this, it’s boils down to the Magic’s offense was awful and tyus is a significantly better playmaker and a more efficient scorer than Cole, it’s just an upgrade</p>

<p>Our offense was bad because we had no three point shooting, hence KCP. And our Cole Anthony lead bench was fourth in the league in scoring, he’s not the problem there. Just admit you don’t know what you’re talking about, it’s not that big of a deal.</p>

They had the cap room and the roster space to do so. Obviously we don’t know what the front office is thinking, but their actions signal to the fans that Tyus isn’t in their plans.</p>

<p>I’m not personally saying Tyus isn’t good or wouldn’t help the Magic, but if he’s not on the roster already it’s probably not going to happen.</p>

<p>Obviously this is a lower scale version of that, but the point stands. KCP is a better player and better fit, they chose KCP which was the right call, that doesn’t mean they don’t want Tyus though</p>

<p>You guys need to stop looking at it as “giving up” like you’re losing something in this trade, if you’re swapping a point guard for a point guard you’re either upgrading or downgrading at backup point guard, there’s no loss because you’re directly replacing the player going out. In this scenario it would be an upgrade</p>

<p>Tyus is a better player than Cole, if they could upgrade that spot and add more reliable shooting and a much better playmaker that would be great for them, magic offense is pretty terrible for an upper level eastern team, they need to improve there any way possible</p>

      <label for="lf1wy5w" class="commentText"><p>Another Magic fan here,</p>

<p>I just dont really see the Magic doing this either unless they plan to clear space. But I think if a S&amp;T happens there is a minimum year or salary that needs to be attached.  Cole is on a very team friendly deal. Tyus and Cole arent that different players imo.</p>

<p>Cole is streaky but he was a pivotal reason for the Magic having the top bench last season for stretches and ending top 3. They only fell when coincidentally Cole&rsquo;s numbers slid.  Tyus is a safer pick but not sure if his upside is Cole&rsquo;s but other Magic poster is really forgetting that Tyus was considered the best bench guard just a few seasons ago. He was considered a top 15 point guard this season.</p>

<p>I would take Tyus over Cole if we are settled with a sustainable bench, but the Magic actually thrive on not just a generally good bench, sometimes the bench needs to pop off to help us win.  Not saying Tyus cant raise the ceiling of the bench and carry games, but Cole really has pop off potential. Which fits well with the defensive guys off the bench.</p>

<p>Though I could see Tyus playmaking doing wonders for the bench with an elite PNR game with Moe or passing to JI open at the corner. Or finding TDS on the cuts.</p>

<p>I actually do like the idea of Tyus with the bench now that I think about it. He is a good scorer himself but with the way I expect our bench to be set up (AB, Cole, Tds, Moe, JI), Tyus elite table-setting will be a perfect compliment. AB is deadly open 3pt shooter, JI is an elite corner 3pt shooter, Moe is an elite finisher and pnr driver,  TDS is projected to be a great open shooter and great cutter. It fits if Tyus sets the table and is able to hit shots at a high volume also.</p>

<p>Is he worth a probably more expensive contract and 2nds I dont think so right now as the Magic need to pay Paolo &amp;Suggs very soon.</p>

<p>but again, why on earth do that when we could have had both if we wanted Tyus at all? Make that make sense. Why give up anything for him when we could have signed him as a FA? Like, actually think about that for sec. What you&rsquo;re suggesting makes absolutely no sense. There is no reason in the world for us to make this trade. You&rsquo;re just talking out of your ass.</p>

<p>Just because you guys <em>preferred</em> KCP over Tyus in free agency, doesn’t mean you in turn don’t want Tyus at all, they don’t play the same position</p>

<p>BECAUSE IF YOU SIGNED HIM YOU COULDNT HAVE GOTTEN KCP AND IT WOULDVE BEEN POINTLESS BECAUSE YOUD STILL HAVE COLE</p>

<p>So assuming Sexton will be gone soon, then there will be plenty of playing time for Tyus Jones, don&rsquo;t you think? Trade one, then build up the value of the other for another trade down the line.</p>

      <label for="lf1c3bk" class="commentText"><p>I definitely see the Jazz as an option, there is absolutely no need to rush Collier&rsquo;s development, and having two inexperienced guards guiding your team at PG is not the best way to develop the rest of your young players. Tyus could either start or come off the bench, and he would be a trade asset down the line.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t see Phoenix as an option, think there&rsquo;s a real shot with the Lakers. Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised there. Don&rsquo;t see Orlando as an option&hellip;they wanna play Black. Fultz was allowed to walk to play Black more. Clippers are said to be out on Tyus.</p>

<p>Depending on the salary, Kings are an option to watch for Tyus. Detroit, Cleveland, Charlotte are teams to watch. Knicks are not 100% out on Tyus either IMO, although they&rsquo;re a real long shot with the showing Kolek had during summer league. Think they&rsquo;re comfortable now with their PG rotation, so they&rsquo;re an unlikely option.</p>
