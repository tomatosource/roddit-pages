      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f87m6p/will_dyson_daniels_be_a_better_fit_next_to_trae/"><p>Will Dyson Daniels be a better fit next to Trae Young than DeJounte Murray?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I know the title is a bit hyperbolic perhaps, but hear me out&hellip;.the bar is pretty low here, as it become abundantly clear last season that Trae and DeJounte just were not going to work together. Both were substantially better with the other off the court. That was true both seasons, but at the end of their first season together and when Quin Snyder was first hired, we did see them start to mesh better as a pair and their net rating improved down the stretch.</p>

<p>Last year, the Hawks &ldquo;normal&rdquo; starting 5 was among the weakest starting units. They had tons of injuries. Hawks were a top 10 offense with Trae on the floor. DeJounte was not the needle mover Trae was. Part of the reason they traded for him was the idea they wouldn&rsquo;t fall off much when Trae went to the bench but it didn&rsquo;t play out that way. DeJounte&rsquo;s defense was not as advertised, which is a factor in that.</p>

<p>In comes Dyson Daniels. He was part of the trade that sent DeJounte to New Orleans. He&rsquo;s had somewhat sporadic time with the Pels, and he&rsquo;s had his injuries, but as it stands now is probably the opening night starter at SG for the Hawks. He&rsquo;s coming off a strong showing for Team Australia in the Olympics. He can really defend; is a nifty passer, high level feel and instincts, good connector. Good athlete. Good cutter off the ball. Has some post up game and decent touch inside.</p>

<p>There are questions surrounding the shot creation and perimeter shotmaking, turnovers have been a problem, but he does check a lot of the boxes in who you conceivably want to pair Trae with in the backcourt. Do you think he&rsquo;ll end up being the better fit next to Trae and a more successful pairing than Trae and DeJounte?</p>

      <label for="llcjwhl" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. Murray was the worst possible fit with Trae. Someone who plays defense and doesn&rsquo;t need the ball in his hands on offense is obviously a huge upgrade, even if he&rsquo;s not as talented overall.</p>

      <label for="llczgjg" class="commentText"><p>Hot take: the swap won&rsquo;t even convey, and those 2 FRPs will be in the 20&rsquo;s. Also one of the 3 First Round Picks is not a real first round pick, that 2023 Charlotte pick is lottery protected until 2025 and then it becomes 2 seconds.</p>

<p>So the Spurs will end up with 2 FRP from ATL and 2 second round picks from ATL.</p>

<p>The Hawks got an unprotected Lakers &lsquo;25 pick and a &lsquo;27 pick that will likely end up being in the 20&rsquo;s, along with Dyson Daniels and Larry Nance who are both valuable role players on affordable contracts.</p>

<p>In my opinion the Hawks emerged from these trades with a clear net positive. I personally don&rsquo;t want them to tear it down and rebuild, so I&rsquo;m not very upset they don&rsquo;t have control of their picks for the next few years.</p>

<p>He canât run offense because heâs not good enough and isnât a good complimentary offensive player because he doesnât space the floor.</p>

<p>The truth is that heâs currently a fun defensive player that wonât be very useful unless he drastically improves</p>

      <label for="lld3gh6" class="commentText"><p>Agree that you can&rsquo;t yet call him effective (with or without the ball) on offense.  Maybe playing with trae will help him settle into a somewhat effective role on that end, but there&rsquo;s no guarantee.</p>

<p>The argument is that a positive defender who&rsquo;s a negative on offense is still a better pairing for Trae than Murray.  The question will be is the hopefully improved defense worth the hit were likely to take on offense?</p>

<p>Secondary playmaking was also the main issue which Murray was supposed to solve, so we&rsquo;ll need to see if JJ, Bogi and Bufkin can fill that void which Murray is leaving on offense.</p>

In Atlanta, he will have lots more room to grow to his potential, improve his offensive game (shooting, playmaking), and get lots of reps on a low-expectation team alongside an incredible floor general in Trae</p>

<p>I really like Dyson, but the comment you&rsquo;re replying to is basically spot on. He is a very good defender and is good in the open floor on steals. However, he is painful in half court offense and his shot needs lots of work. He&rsquo;s good at rotating the ball and making the right passes, but his shooting is a massive negative. It wasn&rsquo;t for lack of playing time in New Orleans that he didn&rsquo;t show it.</p>

<p>But honestly we see this all the time where one way defensive wings/guards get super hyped up just to never turn into a shooter. If he canât shoot he wonât be effective at a high level</p>

<ul>
<li>Dejounte switched on a screen, Malachi blew by Fernando and got a layup.</li>
<li>Dejounte wasn&rsquo;t on the court the next three shots Flynn made.</li>
<li>Dejounte switched on a screen, Malachi blew by Fernando and got a layup.</li>
<li>Flynn used a screen and got an open shot.</li>
<li>Dejounte wasn&rsquo;t guarding Flynn the next two shots</li>
<li>Dejounte was the transition defender in a 2 on 2 situation with a pistons player closest to the basket, then Dejounte, then Flynn, then Hunter. Can&rsquo;t blame Dejounte much for not stopping this.</li>
<li>Dejounte wasn&rsquo;t on the court the next four shots Flynn made.</li>
<li>Dejounte let Flynn get a pretty open 3 off a screen</li>
<li>Dejounte let Flynn score on a cut he made off ball</li>
<li>Dejounte switched and Flynn scored on Bogdan.</li>
<li>Flynn scored a transition 3, Dejounte might have been able to block it if he ran really hard in transition but it also could&rsquo;ve led to a foul</li>
<li>Dejounte committed a silly turnover off a double team leading to a transition layup for Flynn but that has no bearing on his defense</li>
</ul>

<p>Dejounte wasn&rsquo;t on the court for 18 of Flynn&rsquo;s points and wasn&rsquo;t guarding him half of the shots he made when he was on the court. Regardless, judging a player based on one game is pretty silly.</p>

<p>i have watched a lot of dyson daniels because the pels broadcast is probably my favorite. he is absolutely an upgrade over murray. better player? no. but he fits and can play a role the hawks have needed since trae was drafted.</p>

<p>it was the same stuff as when zacc was drafted. trae is and has been a one man offense. dejounte could not play off ball. he couldnât shoot either. and he was bad on defense. dyson plays defense and plays with energy and thatâs all heâs gonna be needed to do. maybe a lob threat as well. iâve seen him freeze up when heâs wide open or fumble away passes constantly, but since he wont be taking the ball out of traeâs hands like dejounte itâs an automatic upgrade</p>

      <label for="lld2e1k" class="commentText"><p>Probably, they won&rsquo;t do much though. Play-in max! Ready for Atlanta to just go ahead and blow it up and trade young to somewhere where he can win. They could have traded Murray for a lot more, imo. Another organization that&rsquo;s full of head scratching moves kok.</p>

      <label for="lldanq3" class="commentText"><p>Hawks will 100% be better in the minutes that Trae is off the court. The Trae/DJ pairing was <em>the worst</em> all star pairing since at least 2000, and the team was more than 5 points per 100 better with just Trae vs both of them off the court. Dyson is already the best perimeter/PoA defender the Hawks have had during the entire Trae era. While he does have some concerns on offense, he&rsquo;ll be playing alongside the best PG he&rsquo;s had in his career so there&rsquo;s a chance we could see growth on that front.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the non-Trae minutes might get a little rough. Dejounte was a really solid primary option, and without him the Hawks are lacking in proven options. Jalen Johnson has shown incredible creation flashes, but he spent most of his minutes with either Trae or DJ on the court with him  (1711 minutes with vs 178 without). He&rsquo;s never been consistently asked to be the first option, so there&rsquo;ll need to be growth there. Bogi can create offense, but he feels best when he&rsquo;s the second option. Kobe Bufkin has shown flashes in the G-League, but he had pretty much no play time in the NBA last season due to injury. Dyson himself has passing skills and some experience at PG (41% play time last season according to bbref), but his limitations on offense are apparent.</p>

<p>I think that the team will come out ahead, but if it doesn&rsquo;t then it&rsquo;ll probably be because of the non-Trae minutes</p>
