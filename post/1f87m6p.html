      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f87m6p/will_dyson_daniels_be_a_better_fit_next_to_trae/"><p>Will Dyson Daniels be a better fit next to Trae Young than DeJounte Murray?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I know the title is a bit hyperbolic perhaps, but hear me out&hellip;.the bar is pretty low here, as it become abundantly clear last season that Trae and DeJounte just were not going to work together. Both were substantially better with the other off the court. That was true both seasons, but at the end of their first season together and when Quin Snyder was first hired, we did see them start to mesh better as a pair and their net rating improved down the stretch.</p>

<p>Last year, the Hawks &ldquo;normal&rdquo; starting 5 was among the weakest starting units. They had tons of injuries. Hawks were a top 10 offense with Trae on the floor. DeJounte was not the needle mover Trae was. Part of the reason they traded for him was the idea they wouldn&rsquo;t fall off much when Trae went to the bench but it didn&rsquo;t play out that way. DeJounte&rsquo;s defense was not as advertised, which is a factor in that.</p>

<p>In comes Dyson Daniels. He was part of the trade that sent DeJounte to New Orleans. He&rsquo;s had somewhat sporadic time with the Pels, and he&rsquo;s had his injuries, but as it stands now is probably the opening night starter at SG for the Hawks. He&rsquo;s coming off a strong showing for Team Australia in the Olympics. He can really defend; is a nifty passer, high level feel and instincts, good connector. Good athlete. Good cutter off the ball. Has some post up game and decent touch inside.</p>

<p>There are questions surrounding the shot creation and perimeter shotmaking, turnovers have been a problem, but he does check a lot of the boxes in who you conceivably want to pair Trae with in the backcourt. Do you think he&rsquo;ll end up being the better fit next to Trae and a more successful pairing than Trae and DeJounte?</p>

      <label for="llcjwhl" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. Murray was the worst possible fit with Trae. Someone who plays defense and doesn&rsquo;t need the ball in his hands on offense is obviously a huge upgrade, even if he&rsquo;s not as talented overall.</p>

      <label for="llczgjg" class="commentText"><p>Hot take: the swap won&rsquo;t even convey, and those 2 FRPs will be in the 20&rsquo;s. Also one of the 3 First Round Picks is not a real first round pick, that 2023 Charlotte pick is lottery protected until 2025 and then it becomes 2 seconds.</p>

<p>So the Spurs will end up with 2 FRP from ATL and 2 second round picks from ATL.</p>

<p>The Hawks got an unprotected Lakers &lsquo;25 pick and a &lsquo;27 pick that will likely end up being in the 20&rsquo;s, along with Dyson Daniels and Larry Nance who are both valuable role players on affordable contracts.</p>

<p>In my opinion the Hawks emerged from these trades with a clear net positive. I personally don&rsquo;t want them to tear it down and rebuild, so I&rsquo;m not very upset they don&rsquo;t have control of their picks for the next few years.</p>

      <label for="lldkcz5" class="commentText"><p>I feel like I&rsquo;m losing my mind right now. I thought I remembered Dyson Daniels hitting some threes in the playoffs this season and being a somewhat decent player for the Pelicans. I just checked his stats, and he went 0/2 all series. Only played in <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the games, averaging 5.7 mpg.</p>

<p>Is there someone else who looks a lot like him, even on another team? My best guess is Jalen Johnson, but he didn&rsquo;t even play in the Hawks 1 play in game this year.</p>

      <label for="lle11gn" class="commentText"><p>There were a number of exhibition games leading up to the Olympics where he also shot well. And 8 points in FIBA is 10+ points in the NBA… he was only playing like 17-20 mins per game iirc. Double his minutes to 32-34 and it’s pretty likely we see something like 12-14 ppg, 46/34/70, with 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals and a block. He’s fairly well rounded for a 6’8” guy, and generally makes good, quick decisions with the ball. I’ve watched a lot of tape on him and I think he fits this Hawks team like a glove with Trae+Jalen as primary creators and scorers so that Dyson can be a “glue guy”</p>

      <label for="lld3gh6" class="commentText"><p>Agree that you can&rsquo;t yet call him effective (with or without the ball) on offense.  Maybe playing with trae will help him settle into a somewhat effective role on that end, but there&rsquo;s no guarantee.</p>

<p>The argument is that a positive defender who&rsquo;s a negative on offense is still a better pairing for Trae than Murray.  The question will be is the hopefully improved defense worth the hit were likely to take on offense?</p>

<p>Secondary playmaking was also the main issue which Murray was supposed to solve, so we&rsquo;ll need to see if JJ, Bogi and Bufkin can fill that void which Murray is leaving on offense.</p>

<p>I really like Dyson, but the comment you&rsquo;re replying to is basically spot on. He is a very good defender and is good in the open floor on steals. However, he is painful in half court offense and his shot needs lots of work. He&rsquo;s good at rotating the ball and making the right passes, but his shooting is a massive negative. It wasn&rsquo;t for lack of playing time in New Orleans that he didn&rsquo;t show it.</p>

      <label for="lldvjfn" class="commentText"><p>Also Dejounte, wasn&rsquo;t putting as much effort into defense his second year with the Hawks like he did when he played for the Spurs.  He is a very capable defender, but I think the lack of effort by Trae really set the tone for the entire Hawks defense.  Trae was such a glaring weak spot on defense, that you could tell that the Hawks players gave up on trying to hide him on defense during the play-in(especially after he took several ill-advised shots).</p>

<li>Dejounte switched on a screen, Malachi blew by Fernando and got a layup.</li>
<li>Dejounte wasn&rsquo;t on the court the next three shots Flynn made.</li>
<li>Dejounte switched on a screen, Malachi blew by Fernando and got a layup.</li>
<li>Flynn used a screen and got an open shot.</li>
<li>Dejounte wasn&rsquo;t guarding Flynn the next two shots</li>
<li>Dejounte was the transition defender in a 2 on 2 situation with a pistons player closest to the basket, then Dejounte, then Flynn, then Hunter. Can&rsquo;t blame Dejounte much for not stopping this.</li>
<li>Dejounte wasn&rsquo;t on the court the next four shots Flynn made.</li>
<li>Dejounte let Flynn get a pretty open 3 off a screen</li>
<li>Dejounte let Flynn score on a cut he made off ball</li>
<li>Dejounte switched and Flynn scored on Bogdan.</li>
<li>Flynn scored a transition 3, Dejounte might have been able to block it if he ran really hard in transition but it also could&rsquo;ve led to a foul</li>
<li>Dejounte committed a silly turnover off a double team leading to a transition layup for Flynn but that has no bearing on his defense</li>
</ul>

<p>Dejounte wasn&rsquo;t on the court for 18 of Flynn&rsquo;s points and wasn&rsquo;t guarding him half of the shots he made when he was on the court. Regardless, judging a player based on one game is pretty silly.</p>

<p>i have watched a lot of dyson daniels because the pels broadcast is probably my favorite. he is absolutely an upgrade over murray. better player? no. but he fits and can play a role the hawks have needed since trae was drafted.</p>

<p>it was the same stuff as when zacc was drafted. trae is and has been a one man offense. dejounte could not play off ball. he couldn’t shoot either. and he was bad on defense. dyson plays defense and plays with energy and that’s all he’s gonna be needed to do. maybe a lob threat as well. i’ve seen him freeze up when he’s wide open or fumble away passes constantly, but since he wont be taking the ball out of trae’s hands like dejounte it’s an automatic upgrade</p>

<p>Dejounte blows Daniels out of the water as a shooter. Dejounte took 7 3s a game and hit 36% of them, those are fine numbers.</p>

      <label for="lldanq3" class="commentText"><p>Hawks will 100% be better in the minutes that Trae is on the court. The Trae/DJ pairing was <em>the worst</em> all star pairing since at least 2000, and the team was more than 5 points per 100 better with just Trae vs both of them off the court. Dyson is already the best perimeter/PoA defender the Hawks have had during the entire Trae era. While he does have some concerns on offense, he&rsquo;ll be playing alongside the best PG he&rsquo;s had in his career so there&rsquo;s a chance we could see growth on that front.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the non-Trae minutes might get a little rough. Dejounte was a really solid primary option, and without him the Hawks are lacking in proven options. Jalen Johnson has shown incredible creation flashes, but he spent most of his minutes with either Trae or DJ on the court with him  (1711 minutes with vs 178 without). He&rsquo;s never been consistently asked to be the first option, so there&rsquo;ll need to be growth there. Bogi can create offense, but he feels best when he&rsquo;s the second option. Kobe Bufkin has shown flashes in the G-League, but he had pretty much no play time in the NBA last season due to injury. Dyson himself has passing skills and some experience at PG (41% play time last season according to bbref), but his limitations on offense are apparent.</p>

<p>I think that the team will come out ahead, but if it doesn&rsquo;t then it&rsquo;ll probably be because of the non-Trae minutes</p>

      <label for="lldsm16" class="commentText"><p>I like Dyson a lot, and I think it&rsquo;s usually a decent gamble for teams to take a shot on high draft picks who don&rsquo;t hit their upside with their first teams. Daniels absolutely fits that mold; he does a lot of things right. On the surface, you might argue that Dyson needs a lot of shooting around him to succeed, and Atlanta doesn&rsquo;t have nearly as much at the Pelicans did.</p>

<p>But when you look at the lineup data, some of Dyson&rsquo;s best lineups last year were with Ingram (35%), JV(31%), and Zion(33%), with the fifth player being Hawkins(37%), Jones(42%), or Alvarado(38%). So all of those lineups feature four 30-35% shooters. And yet those were all lethal offensively (OFFTRG better than 130, NETRTG +15, 25+ minutes played for each, nearly 150 minutes total between those three lineups). And the stats would suggest that it&rsquo;s not just Ingram, JV, and Zion carrying with Dyson having a non-impact: the four-man lineup with those three and Dyson is far better than any other with those three (both offense and net). I have to admit, this is the exact opposite conclusion I expected when I went looking at the lineup data&hellip; I expected to find evidence that Dyson was primarily successful because the Pelicans could surround him with shooters.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t pretend I watched enough Pelicans ball to know exactly why those units did so well on offense; I&rsquo;d guess that it&rsquo;s a combination of rim pressure and connective passing. Maybe Pels fans can chime in there? Regardless, it does suggest that despite being a weaker shooter, putting him in position to succeed offensively is more complex than simply surrounding him with shooters.</p>

<p>But he&rsquo;s so damn good at defense that you&rsquo;re gonna get more fast breaks with him on the court that your overall offense will look better statistically even thought your halfcourt isn&rsquo;t better.</p>

<p>Obviously there’s exceptions but teams are always reluctant to move on from players they drafted, and Daniel displays some pretty obvious flaws that need fixing if he’s ever gonna be a starting level player</p>

Derrick also shot low to mid 30’s % from 3 for the first 4 years of his career, and once he got traded to Boston where he’s a 4th/5th option instead of a primary, all the sudden he started shooting 38%-39% from 3 the last couple years.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To be fair to Nash and Kidd, they probably could have played together, even if you end up  limiting the true effectiveness of both; Nash is a career 42.8% 3 point shooter, and Kidd worked on his shot enough in the late 2000s to where he was shooting above 40%. Granted, you&rsquo;d have to take the ball out of one of their hands to put it into the other&rsquo;s, but I&rsquo;m almost certain they&rsquo;d figure out how to make it work.</p>

      <label for="lldqny6" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. Dyson can seamlessly fit next to Trae whereas with DJ there were learning curves. Add along that DJs defense became somewhat underwhelming in ATL trying to do more on the offensive end, taking touches away from Trae, which I feel like was a bad decision as Trae does what DJ was trying to do at an obscenely better level. I can see ATL surprising people this season</p>
