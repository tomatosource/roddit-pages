</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now that the Olympics are behind us, it&rsquo;s time to look ahead to the 2024-25 season.</p>

<p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to preview each team (grouped by <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake" target="_blank">tiers</a> ). In terms of predictions, we&rsquo;re going to avoid hot takes or bold predictions for the sake of drama and simply go with the most realistic outcome. The truth of the matter is: the biggest differentiator between expected success and results tends to be injury related, so it&rsquo;s difficult to peer into the crystal ball on that front. We&rsquo;re also going to balance every team&rsquo;s wins to be an even .500 across the league, which is something most outlets don&rsquo;t bother to do.</p>

<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s cast a look at the pecking order at the bottom of the <strong>WESTERN CONFERENCE.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>TIER FIVE: THERE&rsquo;S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR</strong></p>

<p><strong>(14) PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>21-61</strong>, -9.0 point differential, # 15 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 29th on offense, 23rd on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: The Blazers dealt width a lot of missed games last season &ndash; 50 from Shaedon Sharpe, 43 from Malcolm Brogdon, 34 from Anfernee Simons, 18 from Jerami Grant. But honestly it may not have changed much because they weren&rsquo;t good at full strength either. <strong>22 or 23 wins</strong> may have been a realistic outcome.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: PG Malcolm Brogdon</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SF Deni Avdija, C Donovan Clingan</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Portland is a good case study for every fan base that gets too excited about their young talent. Quite simply: youth leads to losses. Scoot Henderson may have been a top prospect, but at age 19 he&rsquo;s going to play like one of the worst starters in the NBA. Heck, even Shaedon Sharpe (heading into Year 3) and Ant Simons (heading into Year 7!) are still learning to be winning players themselves.</p>

<p>Adding Deni Advija and Donovan Clingan should help to some degree. Both are good defenders and good culture guys &ndash; particularly in the case of Clingan who&rsquo;s gone 12-0 in the NCAA tournament the last two seasons. If the Blazers get serious about accountability, then maybe they can start climbing the ladder.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>It may be put up or shut up time regarding <strong>Anfernee Simons</strong>&rsquo;s future in Portland. I had to double check my math to confirm that he&rsquo;s been in the league 6 years already. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t feel like that for a player who struggles on defense so much (-2.5 BPM, only 0.5 steals per game). Simons still has his virtues in terms of his shot creation and shot making, but his fit next to Scoot Henderson is still a major question mark. I thought the Blazers may trade him this summer, and that conversation will come up again if the pairing still looks clunky.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The Blazers should inch up the standings &ndash; maybe to <strong>24-58</strong> &ndash; but it depends on how long they want to stay competitive before descending into a tank again.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The Blazers are listed low at 21.5. On paper you can talk yourself into an &ldquo;over&rdquo; here, but it&rsquo;s never fun to bet on bottom feeders. I&rsquo;d rather just <strong>stay away</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(15) UTAH JAZZ</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>31-51</strong>, -4.8 point differential, # 12 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 17th on offense, 30th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: Lauri Markkanen had a great season (25.3 PPG) but did miss 27 games; if he played more, the Jazz should have won more. The Jazz also had bad luck in regard to opponents&rsquo; shooting. Their opponents shot 39.5% from three against them &ndash; the highest mark in the league. Part of that involves poor perimeter defense but part of that tends to regress. Given the extreme nature there, <strong>34 or 35 wins</strong> may have been a more expected result.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: PG Kris Dunn, SG Talen Horton-Tucker</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SF Cody Williams &reg;, C Drew Eubanks, PG Isaiah Collier &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>I recently wrote a post about how Will Hardy&rsquo;s good coaching may have ironically <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dl534r/isnt_it_ironic_dont_ya_think_will_hardys_success/" target="_blank">hurt the team</a>&rsquo;s chances. Overachieving didn&rsquo;t get them playoff tickets OR lottery balls, leaving them in a strange NBA purgatory.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easier to take a step back than take a step forward, which is why those Lauri Markkanen trade rumors make sense. The Jazz don&rsquo;t have one transcendent talent yet, but they do have some interesting prospects like Keyonte George (21 years old), Taylor Hendricks (21 years old), and Cody Williams (19 years old).</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>As a rookie, <strong>Walker Kessler</strong> was a pleasant surprise and looked the part of a future DPOY candidate. He even got a spot on Team USA&rsquo;s FIBA crew. Unfortunately, he stagnated as a sophomore, only starting 22 games as the coaching staff (and some fans) started to lose faith in him. Still, it&rsquo;s hard to believe a team that ranked 30th in defense wouldn&rsquo;t want to play their big shot blocker more. It&rsquo;ll be important for the Jazz to reinvigorate his career &ndash; if not for themselves but as a trade piece at the very least.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>If the Utah Jazz keep Lauri Markkanen and try their best, 35 wins is a fair outcome. But logically, it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense for Danny Ainge to do that. Blowing it up and tanking &ndash; for a <strong>23-59</strong> record perhaps &ndash; is the more tangible path forward. It&rsquo;s a projection at this point &ndash; but it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;d feel comfortable making.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The Vegas over/under is 29.5 wins, which would only be 6th worst in the NBA. My personal prediction is a matter of speculation and the theory that Danny Ainge does not WANT to be the 6th worst team or 7th worst team or 8th worst team, and will eventually put Lauri on ice (like OKC did with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander a few years ago) to chase lottery talent. It&rsquo;s a theory though so not worth a bet &ndash; so <strong>stay away</strong> here.</p>

      <label for="liftlb8" class="commentText"><p>These are great, but can I make a suggestion? Either post a summary separately or put it in the posts themselves how the tiers all look when stacked together. It’s hard to visualize separately like this. (And do all 30 teams rather than east vs west.)</p>

<p>Also iirc Lauri can’t be traded till next season now.</p>
