</a>
    </h2>

<p>&ldquo;I normally don‚Äôt pay attention to these type of comments, but as an African, a leader in my community, and the president of the South Sudan Basketball Federation, I feel it is important to respond. This is for those who have asked about these comments, those who are offended by them, and everyone who has followed our story.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not upset or angry at these ignorant remarks made by my former colleagues; I was more disappointed to see them coming from two individuals I‚Äôve always respected. The comments made by Paul Pierce showed misinformation and a lack of research. However, he used it as a teachable moment to shed positivity once he was informed. Thank you to Paul Pierce for apologising, that i can respect.</p>

<p>Growing up, I heard many similar comments, and those very remarks are some of the things that motivated me to change the narrative. Africans now show solidarity and support for each other more than ever. Moments like this are not for us to get upset and lash out. Many Africans and Black people who embrace their African heritage are working hard to bring all Black people closer by educating and sharing stories and historic moments, teaching that we have much more in common than differences.</p>

<p>As for Gilbert‚Äôs comments, they were certainly more disrespectful and cruel. Personally, I don‚Äôt care much. I would never trade places with anyone; being African is special. However, for young African and African American kids who admire and listen to Gilbert, these comments can make you think less of yourself and make the rest of the world think less of Africans. Those who are easily misled may make comments that reflect self-hate more than pride. There is nothing about our history that we should run away from.</p>

<p>I actually want to thank both of them for giving us this platform to respond and inform others. We‚Äôve worked very hard in the last four years to be here, and we can‚Äôt allow mere seconds to take that away. Instead, let‚Äôs appreciate the moment and use these comments as an opportunity to educate. Being loved is always better than being tolerated.</p>

<p>If we as a people realized the greatness from which we came we would be less likely to disrespect ourselves. üôèüèø&rdquo;</p>

<p>Incredibly thoughtful and classy statement by Luol Deng, who serves as both President of the Federation as well as Assistant Coach, and has been instrumental in South Sudan&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>Again, very well said by Luol Deng, who has worked hard for this historic achievement.</p>

<p>At the same time, this is also the man that said Victor wasn&rsquo;t tough because he &ldquo;spoke a sexy language&rdquo;, so I guess it&rsquo;s on par for him.</p>
