      <label for="l685nqx" class="commentText"><p>So where do you draw the line in the sand?</p>

<p>I studied homeland security and counterterrorism for undergrad. I think most people upon hearing that would say it&rsquo;s useful.</p>

<p>The majority of my classes were religious studies or fell under the criminology or sociology code. I basically have a sociology and religious studies degree.</p>

<p>Edit: To answer everyone at once.</p>

<p>I was an intelligence analyst post college. I did a lot of work focusing on terror groups (foreign and domestic). For a while I helped US Marshalls track down fugitives. I also helped write literature to train individuals that would be interviewing religious extremists and how to deconstruct their philosophy. I later went to grad school for epidemiology and did a bunch of research for DARPA and some bio surveillance.</p>

<p>For those saying it&rsquo;s a fake degree, it was a program specifically curated to understand how someone becomes an extremist but also understand their philosophies. I spent a lot of time studying Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. I also spent a lot of time learning about critical infrastructure and how to dismantle our society as we know it. I was able to connect with some professors in the public health school and did some independent courses to focus on biodefense. In addition to all of that I minored in GIS and did a lot of geospatial Intel work.</p>

Computer science education was nowhere near as valuable 50 years ago as it is today. When do you redraw said line?</p>

<p>Edit: in the interest of not changing the post, CS at 50 years ago (I still feel like 2005 was yesterday) was not the example I thought it was. My entire point is that a major that is of high economical value today may not be tomorrow, and likewise, a major nobody has ever heard of may explode in a short period of time.</p>

But if you were starving or in desperate need of medical attention, you aren&rsquo;t stopping along the way to resolving those things to go to visit an art gallery.  Art is exceptionally important because it&rsquo;s what makes life fun and enjoyable, but it&rsquo;s notably less important than food and medical care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creating art is what we would all do if we had the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the jury is in on that.  If we all had more spare time, we&rsquo;d just spend it on more social media, TV, etc.  I think if art was something more people wanted to do, we&rsquo;d see it register a significant portion on the chart of how people spend their free time.  Creating art doesn&rsquo;t even show up as large enough to be it&rsquo;s own category - <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/men-spent-5-6-hours-per-day-in-leisure-and-sports-activities-women-4-9-hours-in-2021.htm" target="_blank">https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/men-spent-5-6-hours-per-day-in-leisure-and-sports-activities-women-4-9-hours-in-2021.htm</a>  Consuming art, absolutely show up, reading, TV, etc</p>

<p>And yet we don&rsquo;t teach doctors to address root causes of illness, instead developing them as procedure ordering mechanics, and we don&rsquo;t degree farmers at all.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to say.  All societies have cultural expression they value, and, when assessing actual happiness, many others ostensible third world cultures produce inordinately more happiness per capita than we do.</p>

<p>The key is that students know what they are getting into (and I think that is where the issues with higher education lie at the moment). People should be able to study whatever the hell they want - but they should know if what they are studying is basically a one-way ticket to financial ruin. Then let them decide.</p>

<p>If colleges want to keep costs sky-high and greatly beyond what the financial value of those degrees provide, fine, but then they should have to tell all of their students that the degrees they offer are basically worthless.</p>

<p>A little off topic but tuition prices to value really grinds my gears at the moment.</p>

      <label for="l69f9rw" class="commentText"><p>CS grad here. This is false. Maybe if you don&rsquo;t know what CS actually is would you think that.</p>

<p>Could degrees be shortened so you don&rsquo;t need non-major specific courses? Sure. Should all fields/jobs require a degree? Probably not. But I absolutely appreciate the education I got.</p>

<p>Anyone can learn to code, but that doesn&rsquo;t make you an effective programmer. Even crash-course coding boot camps can be 6 months long, and at the end, you know one specific subject, and without a thorough understanding of the systems involved, data structure concepts, etc, it doesn&rsquo;t always easily translate to other subjects or languages.</p>

<p>How can you make such general statements without experiencing the different fields and degree programs? It seems you have a specific experience that has biased you against higher education.</p>

      <label for="l69r3un" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a senior level engineer in a large-ish tech company. My degree is in econ, not CS. I&rsquo;ve been able to pick up best practices and some things on the job, but I&rsquo;d be kidding myself if I said that I was as good as people who studied CS in school. Data structures, algorithms, all of the fundamentals that they teach in school- I&rsquo;m much weaker at than most other engineers at my level.</p>

<p>I would also caveat this by saying that my degree in econ is ALSO useful, just differently useful. I come at problems with a different perspective than many of my coworkers, which adds a lot of value. I have more business acumen too. Realistically, the things that I learned from Econ are not the literal things taught in class, like Solow model or whatever complex calc stuff I needed to learn. It&rsquo;s the critical thinking and problem solving.</p>

<p>College &amp; university is critical for jobs. It&rsquo;s very good to have strong fundamentals taught in school for the work that you are doing. This is especially true the more technical the work is - such as with engineers, accountants, doctors, etc. But it is also true in general. Not everyone can learn on the fly - and you also don&rsquo;t necessarily want people to be doing that. Imagine someone building a plane you fly on not having formal engineering experience. You don&rsquo;t want them to &lsquo;wing&rsquo; it :). At the same time, a variety and richness of experiences in backgrounds makes teams stronger. STEM degrees aren&rsquo;t everything.</p>

      <label for="l69b5nm" class="commentText"><p>Why do people act like college is just some “go to class and get a certificate” type of thing? College is WAY more than that. There is so much shit to do on campus that is a great time and beneficial to your future career goals not limited to student orgs, greek life, business/engineering fraternities (where you get professional development and tons of exposure to companies), and internship experience (the big one). You’ll learn a lot in college, but you’ll also grow a lot as well.</p>

<p>This whole “dumb filter” take is absurd to me. Like… cmon. Why would I even bother interviewing someone who just watched some online videos vs somebody who has actual application in rigorous higher level classes that demonstrate problem solving and collaboration? If that is what you consider a “dumb filter” then I think you should reevaluate your views.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t clear, a CS degree (as well as many other ones) are absolutely not useless lol. Most jobs don’t need degrees, sure. I’m a prime example of that as somebody who majored in accounting and finance, hated the work and work ethic at the internships related to my majors, declined those offers and took one for consulting my senior year, and then left consulting for a supply chain gig of al things (they asked for 4 years of supply chain experience, I had none obviously). Point is, a degree as well as what you have done while getting said degree speaks a whole lot about your character outside of “experience: I watched some videos online.”</p>

<p>Also, the 4-year degree discrimination was born after the Supreme Court said you couldn’t use aptitude tests to weed out black candidates. So we went to a costly metric that most black people weren’t allowed into, and often couldn’t afford.</p>

<p>FYI, you learn these interesting business facts while studying useless degrees like Sociology, History, Black Studies, etc.</p>

<p>The interest rate can be whatever they want because students need the money to go to college. Because you &ldquo;<em>NEED</em> &rdquo; to go to college if you don&rsquo;t want to flip burgers forever (at least that&rsquo;s what we were told growing up). At the same time the odds that you&rsquo;ll earn enough to ever pay it off are dwindling. Oh, and you can never get rid of it unless you work for pennies at an &ldquo;approved&rdquo; non profit for 10 years, become disabled, or die.</p>

<p>Many universities that I looked at when trying to attend said that freshmen and sophomores were required to live in dorms and required to have a meal plan regardless of if they lived nearby barring individual exceptions which would be handled on a case-by-case basis. The argument was that it forced new students to, &ldquo;Integrate and socialize with their peers,&rdquo; when what it does is force you to add a huge expense for inflated prices on shitty housing and cheap food.</p>

<p>I didn’t see that coming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Until 2005, private student loans were eligible for bankruptcy protections just like other forms of private credit. But in that year Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, a law that made it vastly more difficult for struggling former students to rebuild their lives by discharging the debts and starting over.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Biden tried to justify his backing of the 2005 act</p>

<p>No, the fraud committed in the headnotes of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company Supreme Course case in 1886 set into motion the transition of the US economy from serving human beings to serving corporate persons in motion. Corporations did not exist in their current form prior to that case and have become the dominant entity on earth in the timeline since. The Corporate Agenda has been careful to program humanity to accept this as &lsquo;the way it has always been&rsquo; but that is simply untrue.</p>

<p>The great experiment in human liberty mythologized in the America origin story was hijacked by corporate personhood in 1886 and now in fully articulated Corporatism a century+ downstream human lives are the natural resource to be consumed at scale for maximum shareholder profit. Currently less than 10% of US citizens own 93% of the US stock market. This level of inequality is only possible because of corporate personhood.</p>

<p>Corporate Persons eat human lives.</p>

<p>Can the LLC get a loan for education expenses, sure. Can you deduct the loan expenses, Yes.</p>

<p>Can the LLC commit fraud and create a LLC that its only purpose is to get loans and then default on those loans after education. No, thats fraud.</p>

The education improves or maintains skills that are required in the employee’s present employment.
Conversely, an employee can’t exclude educational expense payments or reimbursements from income if either of the following applies:</p>

<p>The education is required for the employee to meet the minimum qualifying educational requirements of his or her present trade or business or employment.
The education qualifies the employee for a new trade or business.”</p>

You would also need to show income to get the loan and the ability to pay back. This is the whole argument with student loans. They are not dischargeable in bankruptcy so there&rsquo;s no risk for the lender, and therefore they don&rsquo;t need to know what your income or potential income is upon graduating, nor do they care about the probability for you to actually graduate.</p>

<p><strong>You can write off school expenses</strong>
The American opportunity tax credit (AOTC) is a credit for qualified education expenses paid for an eligible student for the first four years of higher education. You can get a maximum annual credit of <span class="math inline">\(2,500 per eligible student. If the credit brings the amount of tax you owe to zero, you can have 40 percent of any remaining amount of the credit (up to \)</span>1,000) refunded to you.</p>

<p>The amount of the credit is 100 percent of the first <span class="math inline">\(2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for each eligible student and 25 percent of the next \)</span>2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for that student. </p>

<p><strong>You can currently write off student loans interest without itemizing</strong></p>

<p>The maximum student loan interest deduction is $2,500 or the total amount you paid in student loan interest during the 2023 tax year — whichever is less. The deduction is what’s known as an above-the-line deduction, which means you can claim it whether you take the standard deduction or itemize deductions on your return.</p>

<p>If this person actually knew anyone who flew private, they would know that, unlike social media, real people who fly private have a morning meeting in Des Moines for a specialized insurance contract, then have an afternoon meeting with a tech startup in Omaha.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t rappers drinking with their entourage; it is people who have to be at meetings.</p>

<p>Also, for yachts, you to qualify for business use, the yacht must be used for business purposes at least 50% of the time, and yes, the IRS looks at this in detail.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Born wealthy. The most likely and common cause of this type of extreme disregard for the growing death of the American dream and international counterparts. These people commonly delude themselves into taking credit for their current position of being wealthy, believing that they would have been well off whether born poor or rich, because they are just that smart. In complete disregard of how they&rsquo;d actually stare hunger and a guaranteed lifetime of poverty in the eyes if it comes to it, they overestimate their braveness, and believe they will have saved up or taken the necessary loans to start their own successful company.</p></li>

<li><p>Extremely stupid/brainwashed. Watches videos of warren buffet and other billionaire money-porn on YouTube all day.</p></li>

      <label for="l68b9tc" class="commentText"><p>What if the banks giving out student loans put the chosen degree through the same cost analysis that they do when loaning money to buy a house?</p>

<p>Would the loan applicant earn sufficient money to pay this loan back? What is the earnings trajectory of the chosen career. Possibly keep the monthly payments low in the early years and increase them as you begin earning more.</p>

<p>The issues would be that only wealthy kids could get degrees in teaching, philosophy, journalism, etc. but that’s the luxury of having family money that doesn’t need 100% borrowing.</p>

<p>Maybe your HS gpa could be the equivalent of a credit score and would help determine the interest rate. That would be a fair way to reward those who worked hard in HS as opposed to the ones who screwed around.</p>

      <label for="l68drzz" class="commentText"><p>You can. Start your own business (it is cheap). In some states register an LLC for around $50. Contribute a skill or service meaningfully to society. If you can prove that the courses contribute to your ability to provide goods and service through your business you can expense tuition, books, even necessary travel.</p>

<p>You also cannot deduct yachts. Not sure where that came from. Maybe if your business provides cruises.</p>

<p>If they agree to pay off your student loans, take them for all they have as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>

<p>That said, no company is going to offer to pay off something they don&rsquo;t benefit from.</p>
