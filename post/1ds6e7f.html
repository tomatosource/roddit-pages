    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>There were some seasons where he was shooting 45 percent and 47 percent from 3 point range. Those are on 4-5 3 point shot attempts per game. Now imagine in this era? He could double the number of 3 point attempts to 10. Yes, his efficiency would dip a bit with more attempts. But his 3 point percentage wouldn&rsquo;t dip 10 percentage points. He would still be a very efficient 40+ percent 3 point shooter.</p>

<p>And he was also a great playmaker. Which is also valued in todays league. He would be amazing.</p>

<p>Just to add context your comment; Uncle Cliffy is one of the original switch-first, ask-questions-later bigmen to exist. Could play 1-5 on defense, and fill in any frontcourt position on offense.</p>

<p>He started stretching out to the the 3-point line while playing with Arvydas Sabonis in Portland and became a significant cog for the Phoenix Suns during the Jason Kidd era. Went on to be a journeyman roleplayer with the Pistons, Warriors and Nets.</p>

<p>He also starred on Survivor, so the man really could do it all.</p>

Opposing guards certainly went after him, but mostly in isolation, nothing systematic like you see from the offenses of today.</p>

<p>Also, he was 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; and a very intelligent defender, so it wouldn&rsquo;t go any worse for him than Curry.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They did which is one reason the Suns never won a chip, but teams today are even more effective at doing it.</p>

<p>You didn&rsquo;t have every playoff team back then spamming small/small pick and rolls, or pick and rolls that started 40 feet from the basket, or playing multiple guards and ballhandling wings who could reliably shoot threes off the dribble if you go under a screen.</p>

<p>Those are some of the modern ways that teams punish weak perimeter defenders. Back then if a bad perimeter defender got beat, a lot of times your worst case scenario was you gave up a mid-range jumper. Now you&rsquo;re giving up a three or a dunk/foul.</p>

Nash would&rsquo;ve been better off being surrounded by elite defensive players. He was an offensive elevator that made everyone look better than they were. You can look at the efficiency stats of all of his teammates before, during, and after playing with Nash, and it&rsquo;s really obvious what his offensive impact was.</p>

He got physically bullied by opposing PGs near every playoffs, and the D’Antoni Suns in general often let physical teams get in their head, which other teams knew. </p>

<p>Now could the Suns used someone like Bruce Bowen, Robert Horry or Draymond on their team? Yes, but that’s on management and not Nash.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t think he was as bad defensively as some people say. He was certainly mediocre on D, but not terrible.</p>

Everything that he was good at is not as important in this era, and unlike the other bigs (like Shaq), he wasn’t as athletic as them to be able to run in the open floor/guard on the perimeter. </p>

<p>Would still be a starter but no where near MVP level. </p>

      <label for="lb0h3cn" class="commentText"><p>Today’s offenses so heavily built around seeking switches and bullying a team’s defensive weak link would be a huge issue for Nash. </p>

<p>I actually think someone LESS obviously a progenitor of today’s game might have a bigger impact. Shaq is an obvious one because teams no longer have the kind of player on their roster needed to guard him. </p>

<p>But someone like Stockton would be interesting in such an offensive era. He was actually an excellent shooter too, but at very low volume. </p>

His numbers might look a little better, but so do everyone else&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s probably pretty much the same player impact wise but perhaps more exposed on defense.</p>

<p>He was amazing, he would also be amazing. Not much different than he was tbh.</p>

<p>Ray Allen/Reggie Miller might have been a bit better I think.</p>

      <label for="lb0fvoh" class="commentText"><p>He was more focused and put into a system to pass. He had Finley and Dirk and then Marion and Stoudemire and even Joe Johnson. You’re asking him to become a scorer and take more shots. I don’t see that working in the style and system he runs. The whole fast pace and fast break he runs is what create a lot of his assist and open shots because defense was more worried about his passing. He’s not a create his own shot player despite relatively good and unorthodox handles. He would be like a Mike Bibby running off screens if he becomes a scorer.</p>

The amount of game-changing that would have been required for him to triple his outside attempts and how defenses would have reacted to it makes it extremely difficult to predict how it would have affected his efficiency.</p>

<p>He would not have been able to be an on-ball point guard at his size <em>and</em> to get up that many shots.</p>

Like earlier and later in his career, he wasn&rsquo;t attempting that many three&rsquo;s which brings down his career average. His prime/peak years  (2005-2008) he was attempting 4-5 3&rsquo;s per game. And shooting 43-47 percent from 3.</p>

      <label for="lb07jgf" class="commentText"><p>Because I think you&rsquo;re vastly underrating how hard it is to get up 10 3p attempts per game when you&rsquo;re 6-3, an on-ball guard, and the defense is trying to stop you. It isn&rsquo;t 2k when you simple &ldquo;take more shots&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t really know how Nash was a movement shooter, because he almost never had to take those kinds of shots from distance.</p>

<p>There have only been 15 individual seasons with 10+ attempts in NBA history (Curry 6, Harden 3, Lillard 3, Klay 1, Luka 1, Buddy 1).</p>

<p>Nash would have been amazing and would have shot more in this era, obviously. But you&rsquo;re really underestimating how hard it is to find those shots and how the spike in difficulty affects your percentages.</p>
