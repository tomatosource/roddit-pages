        <div>3 | an hour ago </div>

      <label for="l7szj78" class="commentText"><p>Maybe still the most epic matchup for a Finals.  Both teams had won 3 championships in the 80s.  They had already faced off twice in the Finals with each team winning one.  The 87 Finals was the rematch of a rematch, winner take all for the title of &ldquo;Team of the 80s&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Lakers had a breeze coming out of the West.  They did have a stacked team, though.  Kinda reminiscent of the Celtics this year.  The Celtics had to beat the Bulls, the Bucks, and the Pistons.</p>

<p>The Bulls had Jordan, Oakley, Paxson, and then Gene Banks who became a sportwriter, Corzine was a stiff but they had nobody else so he was the starting center.  So the Celtics frontcourt dominated them, obviously, Oakley wasn&rsquo;t enough to stop all that. (Walton&rsquo;s knees were deteriorating in real time.  He played 15 minutes/game against the Bulls.  10 minutes/ game against the Bucks.  And then no minutes/games against the Pistons).</p>

<p>The Bucks were one of those good teams that sort of get lost in the shuffle because they never made the Finals.  Terry Cummings, Sid Moncrief, Jack Sikma, John Lucas, Rickey Pierce, Paul Pressey, all those guys were good, solid players.  But the East was stacked, so they weren&rsquo;t as good as either the Pistons or the Celtics, but pretty darn competetive.  Took the Celtics to 7 games.</p>

<p>Then the Bad Boy Pistons, as well-built and structured a team as there ever was.  Coached by Chuck Daly.  The Eastern Conference Finals was as epic as the Finals was.  Larry Bird played the best fucking basketball my nephew ass had ever seen anyone play, and the Celtics topped the Pistons.  Also took the Celtics to 7 games, and they lost Walton.</p>

<p>So by the time the Finals actually happened, Boston was a man down and had just run the gauntlet, where the Lakers had a cakewalk.  Not to take away from the Lakers, because holy shit that team was stacked, they were 8-deep.  So when Magic hit this shot, and then Bird juuuuust missed, this was like the Celtics last best chance to take the series, and instead of the series being tied it was 3-1 Lakers.</p>

      <label for="l7spdca" class="commentText"><blockquote>
<p>Magic Johnson borrowed a weapon from Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to beat the Boston Celtics in Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals. With the Celtics clinging to a one-point lead, Johnson got the ball on the left side and drove toward the middle, then lofted what he called a “junior, junior sky-hook” for a 107-106 victory. The Lakers went on to win the series in six games.</p>
