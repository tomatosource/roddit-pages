      <label for="leqpdos" class="commentText"><p>He has had rough stretches in the past. I think the perception of him is hard to get a handle on because of how in and out he is. Before the Bubble, he was pretty inconsistent. Then he had that hot stretch, got injured towards the end, looked rough coming back after the bubble, but then got on a hot streak and then injured. Gone for a season and a half, then looked awful coming back, then hit his hot streak. This season, like the opposite, looked fucking incredible and then fell off and looked awful in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Whether it be due to injuries or anything else, he goes from all-star to ball-stopping, no defense liability.</p>

<p>so it’s not like he’s been beating us down since he ever came in the league. it’s just one series and there’s no way the lakers beat the timberwolves. this team was never gonna go far, almost purely because of ham. a roster like this that’s led by lebron should have made it farther, it was just a year of ham coaching the team into the ground</p>

He battled injuries all year, which I think he is alluding to in not being healthy/rested, but he was a massively liability v the Wolves. If your best defensive &ldquo;stopper&rdquo; can&rsquo;t play defense or make his open 3, wtf is he doing on the court?</p>

<p>I had no problem with Denver losing him. A future Wolves matchup is inevitable at some point and he was borderline unplayable.</p>

But it was MPJ, AARON GORDON AND REST OF THE &ldquo;Role players&rdquo; who literally won every single game for the Nuggets in that series vs the Lakers.</p>

<p>Murray just hit 2 crazy game winners in the same series, and also got the super lucky bounce to go his way as well.   But the game was CLOSE because of MPJ and those role players.  Lakers dominated most of that series, but those Denver role players kept on bringing them back.  MPJ played like prime Durant.  Making pull up 3s with hands in his face.  Gordon just flying about everywhere</p>

<p>Then MPJ and those same role players couldn&rsquo;t even make an open shot against the Wolves next series.   That pissed me off so much lmao   They basically showed up just to beat LeBron and the Lakers somehow, and then went back to sleep</p>

<p>above all, Malone needs to be smarter with his priorities. Nuggets were rested headed into the 23 playoffs and the results were clear. this year, Malone chased seeding until the last regular season game, ended up losing to the combined superpower of Devonte Graham and Sandro Mamukelashvili and enjoyed the worst of all worlds.</p>

      <label for="leqbjb1" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s super tricky with you guys specifically. I&rsquo;m normally of the mind that home court advantage (and thus seeding) isn&rsquo;t especially that important for most teams provided that they&rsquo;re gaining some sort of benefit from dropping to a lower seeding, but Denver&rsquo;s kinda unique in that regard. The altitude is a real, genuine advantage that most teams simply can&rsquo;t really prepare for, so I do think it can be worth overextending your team to try and secure a higher seed when possible. Obviously didn&rsquo;t play out like that this season so I don&rsquo;t genuinely know where I&rsquo;d draw the line, though.</p>

      <label for="leqcwvg" class="commentText"><p>we saw the limits of that strategy in game 7 against the Wolves where it actually looked like the Nuggets were suffering from the altitude, not the Wolves. if the tank is empty, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>I feel like the Nuggets should prioritize HCA in the first round and opt for rest beyond that. when it comes to teams like Minny and OKC, execution and health will be the difference. and rest is a big factor for both.</p>

It literally came down to the final stretch of game 7 too. You just gotta be well rested against any of the top teams in the west right now, there are so many great players and teams with so many ways to beat you</p>

      <label for="leqv3eg" class="commentText"><p>In terms of the altitude being a real advantage… yes and no. If you play 4 games in Denver in a series by Games 5 and 7 you should be fine with it as a professional athlete. And for Game 1 depending on how you time the travel you can make sure you reduce the effect of the altitude. It’s really not as big of a deal as the media makes it out to be. It’s not like pitching at Coors Field</p>

<p>He came up without anything ready for game 1 vs TWolves, while the Wolves played exactly how they did in their best games in the 2023 series (which actually was the hardest competition Denver met the whole 2023 run). He messed up the rotation, and fucked up some of his guys confidence.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m game 7 he didn&rsquo;t rested his guys when up (in 2nd and 3rd) and let them cook until the younger Wolves could overcome the obstacle.</p>

The Gm1 loss felt more like a Lakers hangover, in spite of the week off, to KCP&rsquo;s point, and a bunch of wonky plays that just went the Wolves way. So I don&rsquo;t know if that was necessarily a bad strategy call. Gm2 though&hellip;.</p>

<p>If the Nuggets had got that first seed, they&rsquo;d have walked over the injured Pelicans in the first round, and faced Dallas in the second. Dallas is obviously great, but I like that match-up for Denver.</p>

<p>Win that and they&rsquo;re in the conference finals against probably OKC or tue Wolves. OKC is an interesting. We&rsquo;d have all picked the Nuggets there.</p>

<p>Obviously, the Nuggets lost a close series to the Wolves in the second round. But I think in the more pressured environment of the conference finals, but the with the Wolves feeling a sense of satisfaction just at getting that far, it might well go their way.</p>

<p>IE, I think the Nuggets would&rsquo;ve had a great chance at making the finals if they&rsquo;d nailed down that first seed. Chasing it didn&rsquo;t work out, but I&rsquo;m not sure it was the wrong decision.</p>

<p>An event can’t be an event without a narrative. If you try to have no narrative that can be as bad as having the wrong one.</p>

      <label for="leqacz6" class="commentText"><p>I think more so just how grueling it is to go back-to-back as a champion. The Nuggets had about as good a postseason record as you&rsquo;re realistically going to see in their championship run, and even then, they still played 20 games. You&rsquo;re then getting a much abbreviated offseason, followed by a regular season where every team is throwing their best at you on a night-in, night-out basis because you&rsquo;re the champ. It&rsquo;s obviously not impossible to repeat because we&rsquo;ve seen it done before, but being in that position definitely does wear on guys, both physically and mentally. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that you&rsquo;ll hear even the most competitive players say that it&rsquo;s almost a relief when you&rsquo;re no longer the champion because you get to go back to being the hunter rather than the hunted, if that makes sense.</p>

      <label for="leqbdro" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I think it was the Lowe Post where one of the front office guys was harping on how big the young guys would show up the year after the title and… well, Watson and Braun were fine, but just fine and those were the only two who even saw the floor.</p>

<p>I have hope for Strawther but people were treating Denver like a flawless dynasty after one title run meanwhile they had blatant depth issues in that title run that only got worse.</p>

      <label for="leqcl64" class="commentText"><p>Yea I remember Lowe calling them a CBA casualty because the CBA gives them no wiggle room to add to the roster. </p>

<p>Losing a 6th man like Brown hurts but they had no way to retain him. Denver fans can chime in but Braun and Watson seem to be good defensively mainly at this point. They need to add reliable 3pt jumpers to be more effective (and thus help more in the playoffs). </p>

      <label for="leqdav1" class="commentText"><p>Just to speak on the Lakers side, whenever they went up double digits, it was because they had very high playcalling on offense. Unfortunately, that was also out-of-the-norm for this team. They had an entire season&rsquo;s worth of bad habits rear its ugly head - long stretches of iso-ball and killing the clock without gaining momentum. Defensively, they were a weak team where AD was the sole paint defender and they were lacking in defensive versatility.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only so much they can do, especially when compared to a team like the Wolves.</p>

<p>Its also worth noting that in the regular season Jamal Murray is one of the worst second option on a title contender we’ve seen in a while. That’s not even counting the 15+ games he misses every year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did Murray play in the playoffs last year on the way to the championship when it mattered? He was as good a second option as anybody in the league.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Jokic were to miss an entire season the Nuggets would win 20 games man. The Nuggets are built around him well enough, but its also built for him to hard carry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to call it carrying if it&rsquo;s a team built on complementary skillsets. Otherwise you would be able to swap Jamal Murray or whoever with replacement level players and have the same success.</p>

      <label for="leqleqj" class="commentText"><p>Its also revisionist to not explain why lol. There was a fundamental difrence between the Celtics and Nuggets starting 5.</p>

<p>The Celtics are a group of 5 amazing players that at worst would all be 3rd options on almost every team in the league. In contract, the Nuggets arent as good on an individual level, but they have Jokic that makes them work.</p>

<p>Seriously just watching the Nuggets without Jokic hurts.</p>

He couldn’t do it. Ant was destroying him. And while Jokic doesn’t mind pg duties when it makes sense- making that a MUST part of his job got him tired as hell. Combine that with complete MPJ collapse as well as Gordon in that last game… it was waaay too much for Jokic.</p>

      <label for="ler0z2m" class="commentText"><p>You are correct but only to a point. There’s always gonna be hate for Embiid but it’s magnified when his performance reflects the public sentiment.</p>

<p>KD and LeBron get hate, but they are already indisputably GOAT-tier players so they have some resistance. Every time they get raked for a bad performance they either come back with another legendary game or it just gets written off as them being old/injured.</p>

<p>Giannis got some buffer from his incredible finals performance in ‘21. He’s been hurt in the playoffs since then but no one can say he’s really choked. So sure, he gets some flak when he has a stinker but no one can take away his heroics from a few years ago and his supporters will stand strong on that for a long time.</p>

<p>Jokic has been elite for a long time and it’s been easy to point to his teammates’ injuries as to why he hadn’t won a chip until ‘23. Once he had a healthy team he dominated as usual but was actually able to win it all and he was clearly the best player in the world. Any bad performances afterwards are easily chalked up to being tired from hard-carrying or just one-offs. He is basically immune to slander at this point.</p>

<p>Embiid on the other hand has done what everyone says he’ll do every year: have a god-tier regular season then get hurt in/before the playoffs and is bumped in the first or second round. Until he has a Giannis-level performance he’s never gonna get respect from the fans/media. And I mean a really heroic performance that is undeniably great — if he foul-baits his way to a chip behind all-time performances by Maxey and/or PG he’s gonna continue to be disrespected.</p>

      <label for="leqcsst" class="commentText"><p>People really underestimate how much basketball 82 games really is. Nuggets had to sprint to the finish line to try and keep ahead of the Wolves and Thunder, and then the Lakers played them tough.</p>

<p>This is why teams take parts of the regular season off, or coast to end the season if they can afford it. Celtics did it last year with a huge lead over the East, Nuggets did it the year before where no one was close to catching them except Memphis, Warriors did it in 2022 where they basically conceded the 2 seed to Memphis, LeBron has done it for a while now, the Heat regularly flip the switch in the playoffs after taking the regular season off, the 2016 Warriors chased a record and it cost them.</p>

<p>Don’t be surprised when some team goes all out or is in a tight race and really pushing to stay ahead and then fizzles out at some point in the playoffs because they too ran out of gas. Winning a championship is hard.</p>

      <label for="leqvs8c" class="commentText"><p>A big part of it is also that in a playoff series, the differential effect of Spoelstra&rsquo;s abilities to make adjustments in the focused context of a 7 game series over the opposing coach really shines. That sort of thing is not nearly as much of a factor in the regular season where teams play more of a constant style regardless of the opposition. So effectively, in the playoffs the Heat get a huge coaching buff which makes it seem like they&rsquo;re overachieving relative to their regular season play.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also so much luck that goes into winning in the first place that there&rsquo;s no guarantee you&rsquo;ll see the same road the second time around.</p>

But then he got injured and rested the last month of the season, and came off the bench when he first came back. Klay only played half the season. Draymond missed 6 weeks too.</p>

<p>Hence why the Big 3 came in hot when the playoffs started</p>

<p>Spoelstra&rsquo;s an exceptional strategic coach when he can game plan for a team, and the Heat are probably the most disciplined team in the league, so they can execute his game plans to perfection.</p>

<p>That’s also one of the reasons Ant looked so good against us, all of our guards besides Braun had fucked legs. He could just bully them without much recourse.</p>

The Lakers very well should have beat them but Hamas didn’t know what he was doing and the players themselves couldn’t put together an entire 48 minutes. MPJ played one of the best series of his career as well.</p>

<p> Denver was extremely gassed. Repeats are hard. </p>

<p>The &lsquo;90s-2010s might have made it look easier than it is but it&rsquo;s damn, damn hard to repeat as champions.</p>

      <label for="leqgn8i" class="commentText"><p>This is the butterfly effect of Wemby path and ascension to his GOAT material status, he stole that one game that would help them secure the 1st seed.</p>

<p>Yeah, tbf this came down to Booth/Malone. As someone who like Jokic, I followed the team closely.</p>

<p>Imo, in the <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>2023</sub> year after the ASB, the 2cnd best Nugget player was MPJ but Malone had a hardon with MPJ while he kept blaming for things that he didn’t do and he gave him a short leash.</p>

<p>I have the feeling, they didn’t run enough plays for MPJ this year when he was the biggest reason they had a great year. Murray tend to be cold, revert into tunnel vision and play hero ball for times to times while MPJ is sitting in the corner.</p>

<p>Booth is the biggest reason why they are in this mess, his comment during his interview with KOC really paint him as someone who was heavily invested in the rookies/picks/choice he made and it’s fine.</p>

<p>The thing is, he had shortsighted evaluation because it’s obvious that Jokic never had a good backup except DMC in 2022.</p>

<p>Now, they lost Bruce and it’s was impossible to retain but with comments like these, you know guy he didn’t went from him at the deadline. The new CBA is hitting, you got all these players that can’t do nothing the roster why don’t you just make a small trade for a backup PG better than Reggie or a backup center/forward better than DJ ?</p>

<p>Now, you add the fact KCP wife already denied the reports saying they’re offered a contract like the one he got in Orlando.</p>

<p>They’re a still a great team but the amount thinking they didn’t need Bruce and Brown/Watson would be able to help repeat was funny.</p>

<p>Thats the only way they are gonna develope. And throw them with Jokic more often and let the MPJ, AG and Jamal get more used to playing without him.</p>

      <label for="ler3nm2" class="commentText"><p>I mean if Murray misses those 2 game winners, we’d have two OT games. And maybe the lakers can win one or both. If they win one of them, the Nuggets’d be up 3-2 with a game 6 in LA. If they manage to win both the Lakers are up 3-2 with a chance to close it out in LA for game 6.</p>

<p>These are major what-ifs. It’s perfectly possible the Nuggets would still win both in OT and this becomes moot. I mean, it’s moot no matter what. It’s just speculation.</p>
