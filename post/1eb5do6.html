      <label for="leqacz6" class="commentText"><p>I think more so just how grueling it is to go back-to-back as a champion. The Nuggets had about as good a postseason record as you&rsquo;re realistically going to see in their championship run, and even then, they still played 20 games. You&rsquo;re then getting a much abbreviated offseason, followed by a regular season where every team is throwing their best at you on a night-in, night-out basis because you&rsquo;re the champ. It&rsquo;s obviously not impossible to repeat because we&rsquo;ve seen it done before, but being in that position definitely does wear on guys, both physically and mentally. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that you&rsquo;ll hear even the most competitive players say that it&rsquo;s almost a relief when you&rsquo;re no longer the champion because you get to go back to being the hunter rather than the hunted, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>I have hope for Strawther but people were treating Denver like a flawless dynasty after one title run meanwhile they had blatant depth issues in that title run that only got worse.</p>

      <label for="leqcl64" class="commentText"><p>Yea I remember Lowe calling them a CBA casualty because the CBA gives them no wiggle room to add to the roster. </p>

<p>Losing a 6th man like Brown hurts but they had no way to retain him. Denver fans can chime in but Braun and Watson seem to be good defensively mainly at this point. They need to add reliable 3pt jumpers to be more effective (and thus help more in the playoffs). </p>

All that both me and the original comment pointed out is this years wolves were much better than any team the Nuggets faced during their championship run.</p>

      <label for="leqgnml" class="commentText"><p>I mean that is just factually not true. This years Wolves team almost got swept in the next round, the Nuggets played last years Suns team, who were favored before the series started, and last year Lakers, who were the best team by record after they overhauled their team at the deadline, before the Nuggets swept them. The Wolves are a team designed to beat the Nuggets and the Nuggets still should have beat them in game seven, even though they were worse than the previous years team and they were tired from trying to play out the end of the season.</p>

Cool the Lakers had the best record in a 26 game sample. The Wolves in a full season sample had a better record and net rating this season than either the Suns last year or the Lakers (post trade deadline last year).</p>

The 2023 Lakers and Suns were better teams than the 2024 Wolves, the wolves are just a team designed to beat the Nuggets, and they did, barely. Then they got destroyed by the Mavs. They aren&rsquo;t that good of a team man.</p>

      <label for="leqdav1" class="commentText"><p>Just to speak on the Lakers side, whenever they went up double digits, it was because they had very high playcalling on offense. Unfortunately, that was also out-of-the-norm for this team. They had an entire season&rsquo;s worth of bad habits rear its ugly head - long stretches of iso-ball and killing the clock without gaining momentum. Defensively, they were a weak team where AD was the sole paint defender and they were lacking in defensive versatility.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only so much they can do, especially when compared to a team like the Wolves.</p>

People don&rsquo;t understand the load Jokic has to carry, and people don&rsquo;t understand that whenever Jokic sits everything goes to shit which increases the load of every starter as well. And so when you cut the rotation to 8 in the playoffs ofc the guys you overly relied on the entire season are gonna be gassed.</p>

With Bruce Brown not on the team, the length of the season, and having a less effective 8-man rotation, I think the Lakers series absolutely affected them.

Basically, the problem wasn&rsquo;t the first round or the Lakers, the problem was getting there fatigued already.</p>

<p>Even if you think Lakers were the biggest threat they could&rsquo;ve faced, they would&rsquo;ve gotten stopped at some point even if they faced the easiest opponent in the 1st round. And I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the case if they had been rested.</p>

<p>above all, Malone needs to be smarter with his priorities.

      <label for="leqbjb1" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s super tricky with you guys specifically. I&rsquo;m normally of the mind that home court advantage (and thus seeding) isn&rsquo;t especially that important for most teams provided that they&rsquo;re gaining some sort of benefit from dropping to a lower seeding, but Denver&rsquo;s kinda unique in that regard. The altitude is a real, genuine advantage that most teams simply can&rsquo;t really prepare for, so I do think it can be worth overextending your team to try and secure a higher seed when possible. Obviously didn&rsquo;t play out like that this season so I don&rsquo;t genuinely know where I&rsquo;d draw the line, though.</p>

<p>I feel like the Nuggets should prioritize HCA in the first round and opt for rest beyond that. when it comes to teams like Minny and OKC, execution and health will be the difference. and rest is a big factor for both.</p>

<p>It simply comes down to last year they actually had to play a single 50-win team lol. Resting a few more games in the regular season isn&rsquo;t going to make nearly as much of a difference as having significantly easier opponents.</p>

      <label for="leqibzg" class="commentText"><p>such a lazy NBA twitter argument that falls apart upon scrutiny.</p>

<p>the Nuggets would&rsquo;ve easily dispatched the 57 win Celtics if they managed to complete the 0-3 comeback. probably a sweep or 5 game series due to the rest factor.</p>

<p>the Lakers had like a 70% win percentage after the Westbrook trade. why the Nuggets are being penalized because Pelinka didn&rsquo;t have the foresight to trade Russ earlier, I have no idea.</p>

<p>the Nuggets were underdogs against the Suns. I know the ESPN &ldquo;experts&rdquo; had Phoenix at 13-4 and I&rsquo;m sure Vegas favored them.</p>

<p>the Nuggets did not roll through a bunch of Pascal Siakam led teams. it&rsquo;s a funny jab at the Nuggets if you don&rsquo;t look at the context.</p>

<p>He was big part of the reason obviously, but they are clearly talented players independant of him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How did Murray play in the playoffs last year on the way to the championship when it mattered? He was as good a second option as anybody in the league.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to call it carrying if it&rsquo;s a team built on complementary skillsets. Otherwise you would be able to swap Jamal Murray or whoever with replacement level players and have the same success.</p>

<p>The Celtics are a group of 5 amazing players that at worst would all be 3rd options on almost every team in the league. In contract, the Nuggets arent as good on an individual level, but they have Jokic that makes them work.</p>

<p>Seriously just watching the Nuggets without Jokic hurts.</p>

      <label for="leqcsst" class="commentText"><p>People really underestimate how much basketball 82 games really is. Nuggets had to sprint to the finish line to try and keep ahead of the Wolves and Thunder, and then the Lakers played them tough.</p>

<p>This is why teams take parts of the regular season off, or coast to end the season if they can afford it. Celtics did it last year with a huge lead over the East, Nuggets did it the year before where no one was close to catching them except Memphis, Warriors did it in 2022 where they basically conceded the 2 seed to Memphis, LeBron has done it for a while now, the Heat regularly flip the switch in the playoffs after taking the regular season off, the 2016 Warriors chased a record and it cost them.</p>

<p>Don’t be surprised when some team goes all out or is in a tight race and really pushing to stay ahead and then fizzles out at some point in the playoffs because they too ran out of gas. Winning a championship is hard.</p>

      <label for="leqgn8i" class="commentText"><p>This is the butterfly effect of Wemby path and ascension to his GOAT material status, he stole that one game that would help them secure the 1st seed.</p>

<p>Yeah, tbf this came down to Booth/Malone. As someone who like Jokic, I followed the team closely.</p>

<p>Imo, in the <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>2023</sub> year after the ASB, the 2cnd best Nugget player was MPJ but Malone had a hardon with MPJ while he kept blaming for things that he didn’t do and he gave him a short leash.</p>

<p>I have the feeling, they didn’t run enough plays for MPJ this year when he was the biggest reason they had a great year. Murray tend to be cold, revert into tunnel vision and play hero ball for times to times while MPJ is sitting in the corner.</p>

<p>Booth is the biggest reason why they are in this mess, his comment during his interview with KOC really paint him as someone who was heavily invested in the rookies/picks/choice he made and it’s fine.</p>

<p>The thing is, he had shortsighted evaluation because it’s obvious that Jokic never had a good backup except DMC in 2022.</p>

<p>Now, they lost Bruce and it’s was impossible to retain but with comments like these, you know guy he didn’t went from him at the deadline. The new CBA is hitting, you got all these players that can’t do nothing the roster why don’t you just make a small trade for a backup PG better than Reggie or a backup center/forward better than DJ ?</p>

<p>Now, you add the fact KCP wife already denied the reports saying they’re offered a contract like the one he got in Orlando.</p>

<p>They’re a still a great team but the amount thinking they didn’t need Bruce and Brown/Watson would be able to help repeat was funny.</p>
