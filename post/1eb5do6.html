      <label for="leqpdos" class="commentText"><p>He has had rough stretches in the past. I think the perception of him is hard to get a handle on because of how in and out he is. Before the Bubble, he was pretty inconsistent. Then he had that hot stretch, got injured towards the end, looked rough coming back after the bubble, but then got on a hot streak and then injured. Gone for a season and a half, then looked awful coming back, then hit his hot streak. This season, like the opposite, looked fucking incredible and then fell off and looked awful in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Whether it be due to injuries or anything else, he goes from all-star to ball-stopping, no defense liability.</p>

He battled injuries all year, which I think he is alluding to in not being healthy/rested, but he was a massively liability v the Wolves. If your best defensive &ldquo;stopper&rdquo; can&rsquo;t play defense or make his open 3, wtf is he doing on the court?</p>

<p>I had no problem with Denver losing him. A future Wolves matchup is inevitable at some point and he was borderline unplayable.</p>

      <label for="leq96jo" class="commentText"><p>that was the overwhelming feeling watching the games as a Nugget fan.</p>

<p>above all, Malone needs to be smarter with his priorities. Nuggets were rested headed into the 23 playoffs and the results were clear. this year, Malone chased seeding until the last regular season game, ended up losing to the combined superpower of Devonte Graham and Sandro Mamukelashvili and enjoyed the worst of all worlds.</p>

      <label for="leqbjb1" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s super tricky with you guys specifically. I&rsquo;m normally of the mind that home court advantage (and thus seeding) isn&rsquo;t especially that important for most teams provided that they&rsquo;re gaining some sort of benefit from dropping to a lower seeding, but Denver&rsquo;s kinda unique in that regard. The altitude is a real, genuine advantage that most teams simply can&rsquo;t really prepare for, so I do think it can be worth overextending your team to try and secure a higher seed when possible. Obviously didn&rsquo;t play out like that this season so I don&rsquo;t genuinely know where I&rsquo;d draw the line, though.</p>

<p>I feel like the Nuggets should prioritize HCA in the first round and opt for rest beyond that. when it comes to teams like Minny and OKC, execution and health will be the difference. and rest is a big factor for both.</p>

<p>You can train your whole life in Boulder but you will still always run a faster mile at sea level and fatigue less at sea level.  You will have an easier time running a fast mile at elevation than someone who doesn’t live there, but it’s still harder on both your bodies than sea level is.</p>

      <label for="lern2ox" class="commentText"><p>If you live at elevation your body literally creates enough blood cells to make it so the altitude has less of an effect on you. This is why you can run a faster mile at sea level, your blood is more efficient at carrying oxygen. It only gets not efficient at carrying oxygen when you exercise above the altitude you live at. One of the reasons the Olympic training center is in Colorado Springs. People who live at altitude do not get more tired when they exercise at that altitude than people who don’t. It may be harder on your body than if you did it at sea level, but your body also has changed to make it not actually that hard on you.</p>

<p>One interesting thing: for endurance athletes there’s a growing body of evidence that in order to perform well when going to a higher elevation you want to time it so you spend as little time in elevation as possible before your event.</p>

This doesn’t mean the altitude is gonna be easy on you, it just means your body won’t be working harder days before to keep you going in general. Your body is just a bit more fresh.</p>

If you play 4 games in Denver in a series by Games 5 and 7 you should be fine with it as a professional athlete. And for Game 1 depending on how you time the travel you can make sure you reduce the effect of the altitude. It’s really not as big of a deal as the media makes it out to be. It’s not like pitching at Coors Field</p>

<p>He came up without anything ready for game 1 vs TWolves, while the Wolves played exactly how they did in their best games in the 2023 series (which actually was the hardest competition Denver met the whole 2023 run). He messed up the rotation, and fucked up some of his guys confidence.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m game 7 he didn&rsquo;t rested his guys when up (in 2nd and 3rd) and let them cook until the younger Wolves could overcome the obstacle.</p>

Going back to KCP over and over again even though Ant was cooking him just felt like a &ldquo;I must defer to my vets&rdquo; move, instead of going for a win.</p>

<p>Also my personal least favorite coaching move was going to the absolute ass line up of Reggie, Jamal and bench guys during the regular season. Reggie and Jamal take turns dribbling around for 21 seconds before either taking a shitty contested shot or passing a grenade to Christian Braun or Peyton Watson.</p>

<p>Stalled out developing the young guys over the season because he treats Jamal like an All-NBA player who can lead a team himself, when Jamal is not that guy.</p>

<p>Then at different points in the season he called out CB and PWat passive aggressively, as if they weren&rsquo;t working hard enough, when really they sucked because he just put them in losing situations. Any time they were in a line up with Jokic or even staggered line ups w Jamal and AG/MPJ, they looked so much better. Go figure.</p>

<p>If the Nuggets had got that first seed, they&rsquo;d have walked over the injured Pelicans in the first round, and faced Dallas in the second. Dallas is obviously great, but I like that match-up for Denver.</p>

<p>Win that and they&rsquo;re in the conference finals against probably OKC or tue Wolves. OKC is an interesting. We&rsquo;d have all picked the Nuggets there.</p>

<p>Obviously, the Nuggets lost a close series to the Wolves in the second round. But I think in the more pressured environment of the conference finals, but the with the Wolves feeling a sense of satisfaction just at getting that far, it might well go their way.</p>

<p>IE, I think the Nuggets would&rsquo;ve had a great chance at making the finals if they&rsquo;d nailed down that first seed. Chasing it didn&rsquo;t work out, but I&rsquo;m not sure it was the wrong decision.</p>

      <label for="ler7133" class="commentText"><p>I don’t buy that the wolves would have been happy to just be in the conference finals if it were the Nuggets specifically in that matchup. They wanted to beat the Nuggets very specifically. It had less to do with reaching the conference finals and more to do with that opponent. Playing a team so many games in a 1 year and some change sample size breeds contempt.</p>

      <label for="leqacz6" class="commentText"><p>I think more so just how grueling it is to go back-to-back as a champion. The Nuggets had about as good a postseason record as you&rsquo;re realistically going to see in their championship run, and even then, they still played 20 games. You&rsquo;re then getting a much abbreviated offseason, followed by a regular season where every team is throwing their best at you on a night-in, night-out basis because you&rsquo;re the champ. It&rsquo;s obviously not impossible to repeat because we&rsquo;ve seen it done before, but being in that position definitely does wear on guys, both physically and mentally. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that you&rsquo;ll hear even the most competitive players say that it&rsquo;s almost a relief when you&rsquo;re no longer the champion because you get to go back to being the hunter rather than the hunted, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>I have hope for Strawther but people were treating Denver like a flawless dynasty after one title run meanwhile they had blatant depth issues in that title run that only got worse.</p>

      <label for="leqcl64" class="commentText"><p>Yea I remember Lowe calling them a CBA casualty because the CBA gives them no wiggle room to add to the roster. </p>

<p>Losing a 6th man like Brown hurts but they had no way to retain him. Denver fans can chime in but Braun and Watson seem to be good defensively mainly at this point. They need to add reliable 3pt jumpers to be more effective (and thus help more in the playoffs). </p>

      <label for="leqdav1" class="commentText"><p>Just to speak on the Lakers side, whenever they went up double digits, it was because they had very high playcalling on offense. Unfortunately, that was also out-of-the-norm for this team. They had an entire season&rsquo;s worth of bad habits rear its ugly head - long stretches of iso-ball and killing the clock without gaining momentum. Defensively, they were a weak team where AD was the sole paint defender and they were lacking in defensive versatility.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only so much they can do, especially when compared to a team like the Wolves.</p>

      <label for="leqcsst" class="commentText"><p>People really underestimate how much basketball 82 games really is. Nuggets had to sprint to the finish line to try and keep ahead of the Wolves and Thunder, and then the Lakers played them tough.</p>

<p>This is why teams take parts of the regular season off, or coast to end the season if they can afford it. Celtics did it last year with a huge lead over the East, Nuggets did it the year before where no one was close to catching them except Memphis, Warriors did it in 2022 where they basically conceded the 2 seed to Memphis, LeBron has done it for a while now, the Heat regularly flip the switch in the playoffs after taking the regular season off, the 2016 Warriors chased a record and it cost them.</p>

<p>Don’t be surprised when some team goes all out or is in a tight race and really pushing to stay ahead and then fizzles out at some point in the playoffs because they too ran out of gas. Winning a championship is hard.</p>

Even if they put in the full effort, I can’t see them as any higher than like a 4th seed and as history shows, a 4 seed isn’t winning a championship unless they were on a repeat run</p>

<p>He was big part of the reason obviously, but they are clearly talented players independant of him.</p>

<p>How did Murray play in the playoffs last year on the way to the championship when it mattered? He was as good a second option as anybody in the league.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to call it carrying if it&rsquo;s a team built on complementary skillsets. Otherwise you would be able to swap Jamal Murray or whoever with replacement level players and have the same success.</p>

      <label for="ler0z2m" class="commentText"><p>You are correct but only to a point. There’s always gonna be hate for Embiid but it’s magnified when his performance reflects the public sentiment.</p>

<p>KD and LeBron get hate, but they are already indisputably GOAT-tier players so they have some resistance. Every time they get raked for a bad performance they either come back with another legendary game or it just gets written off as them being old/injured.</p>

<p>Giannis got some buffer from his incredible finals performance in ‘21. He’s been hurt in the playoffs since then but no one can say he’s really choked. So sure, he gets some flak when he has a stinker but no one can take away his heroics from a few years ago and his supporters will stand strong on that for a long time.</p>

<p>Jokic has been elite for a long time and it’s been easy to point to his teammates’ injuries as to why he hadn’t won a chip until ‘23. Once he had a healthy team he dominated as usual but was actually able to win it all and he was clearly the best player in the world. Any bad performances afterwards are easily chalked up to being tired from hard-carrying or just one-offs. He is basically immune to slander at this point.</p>

<p>Embiid on the other hand has done what everyone says he’ll do every year: have a god-tier regular season then get hurt in/before the playoffs and is bumped in the first or second round. Until he has a Giannis-level performance he’s never gonna get respect from the fans/media. And I mean a really heroic performance that is undeniably great — if he foul-baits his way to a chip behind all-time performances by Maxey and/or PG he’s gonna continue to be disrespected.</p>

      <label for="lerlqin" class="commentText"><p>Felt like the Lakers were the team that kept running out of gas in that series. I think they really missed Vando and Christian Wood in that series, as it basically gave them no front court bench against one of the biggest teams in the league. AD, LeBron and Rui started, and the only front court guys they could bring in off the bench were Prince, who&rsquo;s an extremely small 3, and Jaxson Hayes, who Ham refused to play. You could see how gassed Rui was with all his missed easy shots, and LeBron as well looked very worn down in the second halves of those games. The Lakers really needed more guys up front in that series.</p>

      <label for="les4x2u" class="commentText"><p>They couldn’t find a closing lineup that worked. They relied on a lot of Lebron hero ball during the fourth for most of the season and would just pray that Reaves, Russell or Rui could contribute enough. They never really made an effort to include AD and it was just up to him to cleanup the glass or iso. They were actually a decent 4th quarter team but the Nuggets starting 5 was significantly better than any 5 the Lakers could throw out there. Lakers really need a two-way player who can be slotted in at the end of games and not have to worry about them being a liability on either end.</p>

      <label for="les6mu5" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m hoping Knecht can develop into that kind of player, even though I know his poor defense is one of his hallmarks. He seems like he has the size, length and athleticism to become a good defender, so I&rsquo;m hoping if he isn&rsquo;t being relied on to carry the scoring load like he was in college, he&rsquo;ll maybe be able to focus more effort to the defensive end. He may just not have the mindset or aptitude for it though, we&rsquo;ll have to see.</p>

<p>If not him, maybe Max Christie can make bigger strides this year, now that he seems sure to get more minutes.</p>

<p>Nuggets insiders said that some players were &ldquo;okay&rdquo; with losing and that pissed Jokic off. That&rsquo;s one of the main reasons Jokic pushed for a competitor like Russ.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;90s-2010s might have made it look easier than it is but it&rsquo;s damn, damn hard to repeat as champions.</p>

      <label for="leqgn8i" class="commentText"><p>This is the butterfly effect of Wemby path and ascension to his GOAT material status, he stole that one game that would help them secure the 1st seed.</p>

<p>Yeah, tbf this came down to Booth/Malone. As someone who like Jokic, I followed the team closely.</p>

<p>Imo, in the <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>2023</sub> year after the ASB, the 2cnd best Nugget player was MPJ but Malone had a hardon with MPJ while he kept blaming for things that he didn’t do and he gave him a short leash.</p>

<p>I have the feeling, they didn’t run enough plays for MPJ this year when he was the biggest reason they had a great year. Murray tend to be cold, revert into tunnel vision and play hero ball for times to times while MPJ is sitting in the corner.</p>

<p>Booth is the biggest reason why they are in this mess, his comment during his interview with KOC really paint him as someone who was heavily invested in the rookies/picks/choice he made and it’s fine.</p>

<p>The thing is, he had shortsighted evaluation because it’s obvious that Jokic never had a good backup except DMC in 2022.</p>

<p>Now, they lost Bruce and it’s was impossible to retain but with comments like these, you know guy he didn’t went from him at the deadline. The new CBA is hitting, you got all these players that can’t do nothing the roster why don’t you just make a small trade for a backup PG better than Reggie or a backup center/forward better than DJ ?</p>

<p>Now, you add the fact KCP wife already denied the reports saying they’re offered a contract like the one he got in Orlando.</p>

<p>They’re a still a great team but the amount thinking they didn’t need Bruce and Brown/Watson would be able to help repeat was funny.</p>

<p>Thats the only way they are gonna develope. And throw them with Jokic more often and let the MPJ, AG and Jamal get more used to playing without him.</p>

If they win one of them, the Nuggets’d be up 3-2 with a game 6 in LA. If they manage to win both the Lakers are up 3-2 with a chance to close it out in LA for game 6.</p>

<p>These are major what-ifs. It’s perfectly possible the Nuggets would still win both in OT and this becomes moot. I mean, it’s moot no matter what. It’s just speculation.</p>
