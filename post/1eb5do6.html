      <label for="leqpdos" class="commentText"><p>He has had rough stretches in the past. I think the perception of him is hard to get a handle on because of how in and out he is. Before the Bubble, he was pretty inconsistent. Then he had that hot stretch, got injured towards the end, looked rough coming back after the bubble, but then got on a hot streak and then injured. Gone for a season and a half, then looked awful coming back, then hit his hot streak. This season, like the opposite, looked fucking incredible and then fell off and looked awful in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Whether it be due to injuries or anything else, he goes from all-star to ball-stopping, no defense liability.</p>

      <label for="leqviq6" class="commentText"><p>He’s not wrong. Against Ant, Braun was a way more effective defender than KCP. Braun also shot better. KCP only shot 41% that series and was a major reason we lost. He would have gotten way more scrutiny if not for the fact that his poor performance was overshadowed by Murray and MPJ.</p>

<p>above all, Malone needs to be smarter with his priorities. Nuggets were rested headed into the 23 playoffs and the results were clear. this year, Malone chased seeding until the last regular season game, ended up losing to the combined superpower of Devonte Graham and Sandro Mamukelashvili and enjoyed the worst of all worlds.</p>

      <label for="leqbjb1" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s super tricky with you guys specifically. I&rsquo;m normally of the mind that home court advantage (and thus seeding) isn&rsquo;t especially that important for most teams provided that they&rsquo;re gaining some sort of benefit from dropping to a lower seeding, but Denver&rsquo;s kinda unique in that regard. The altitude is a real, genuine advantage that most teams simply can&rsquo;t really prepare for, so I do think it can be worth overextending your team to try and secure a higher seed when possible. Obviously didn&rsquo;t play out like that this season so I don&rsquo;t genuinely know where I&rsquo;d draw the line, though.</p>

<p>I feel like the Nuggets should prioritize HCA in the first round and opt for rest beyond that. when it comes to teams like Minny and OKC, execution and health will be the difference. and rest is a big factor for both.</p>

It literally came down to the final stretch of game 7 too. You just gotta be well rested against any of the top teams in the west right now, there are so many great players and teams with so many ways to beat you</p>

If you play 4 games in Denver in a series by Games 5 and 7 you should be fine with it as a professional athlete. And for Game 1 depending on how you time the travel you can make sure you reduce the effect of the altitude. It’s really not as big of a deal as the media makes it out to be. It’s not like pitching at Coors Field</p>

<p>He came up without anything ready for game 1 vs TWolves, while the Wolves played exactly how they did in their best games in the 2023 series (which actually was the hardest competition Denver met the whole 2023 run). He messed up the rotation, and fucked up some of his guys confidence.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m game 7 he didn&rsquo;t rested his guys when up (in 2nd and 3rd) and let them cook until the younger Wolves could overcome the obstacle.</p>

      <label for="lequkqo" class="commentText"><p>I think losing Bruce Brown hurt you guys more than most anticipated, because after that your bench was paper thin. A couple of nice reserves in Braun and Jackson, but almost no scoring punch and no sense of depth or reserves. If the starters weren&rsquo;t clicking the bench was very limited in how it could pick up the slack. That wears on the starters more than minutes played would suggest, since they have to work harder in those minutes played to stay afloat without a strong bench.</p>

      <label for="leqacz6" class="commentText"><p>I think more so just how grueling it is to go back-to-back as a champion. The Nuggets had about as good a postseason record as you&rsquo;re realistically going to see in their championship run, and even then, they still played 20 games. You&rsquo;re then getting a much abbreviated offseason, followed by a regular season where every team is throwing their best at you on a night-in, night-out basis because you&rsquo;re the champ. It&rsquo;s obviously not impossible to repeat because we&rsquo;ve seen it done before, but being in that position definitely does wear on guys, both physically and mentally. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence that you&rsquo;ll hear even the most competitive players say that it&rsquo;s almost a relief when you&rsquo;re no longer the champion because you get to go back to being the hunter rather than the hunted, if that makes sense.</p>

      <label for="leqcl64" class="commentText"><p>Yea I remember Lowe calling them a CBA casualty because the CBA gives them no wiggle room to add to the roster. </p>

<p>Losing a 6th man like Brown hurts but they had no way to retain him. Denver fans can chime in but Braun and Watson seem to be good defensively mainly at this point. They need to add reliable 3pt jumpers to be more effective (and thus help more in the playoffs). </p>

      <label for="leqdjy8" class="commentText"><p>They only really lost Bruce Brown tho. I kinda see why FO thought rookie could fill the gap esp CB was rising. But ya, Murray was playing bad the whole playoffs tbh.</p>

<p>EDIT: oh sorry, i forgot Jeff Green but i didn&rsquo;t think he was that great in 2023 as much as BB.</p>

That one guy alone was a LOT of bench flexibility they never fixed and still haven’t unless someone somewhere somehow makes a huge jump in production I don’t see coming.</p>

Unfortunately, that was also out-of-the-norm for this team. They had an entire season&rsquo;s worth of bad habits rear its ugly head - long stretches of iso-ball and killing the clock without gaining momentum. Defensively, they were a weak team where AD was the sole paint defender and they were lacking in defensive versatility.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only so much they can do, especially when compared to a team like the Wolves.</p>

<p>He was big part of the reason obviously, but they are clearly talented players independant of him.</p>

<p>How did Murray play in the playoffs last year on the way to the championship when it mattered? He was as good a second option as anybody in the league.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to call it carrying if it&rsquo;s a team built on complementary skillsets. Otherwise you would be able to swap Jamal Murray or whoever with replacement level players and have the same success.</p>

<p>No it&rsquo;s not a coincidence at all. You&rsquo;re basically agreeing with whole point.

When the Nuggets had post-season success it&rsquo;s because he was a great player surrounded by other good players playing well.</p>

      <label for="leqt5a7" class="commentText"><p>Who said anything about all-time level? I just said he was as good a second option as anybody in the league in the 2023 playoffs.</p>

<p>Other second options from the final four teams:</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown: 22.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.4  57% TS</p>

<p>Bam Adebayo: 17.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.7 53% TS</p>

<p>Anthony Davis: 22.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.6 59% TS</p>

<p>Probably second best after AD when you factor in defense but I think it&rsquo;s pretty reasonable to put Murray&rsquo;s performance in the same bracket as these 3.</p>

<p>The Celtics are a group of 5 amazing players that at worst would all be 3rd options on almost every team in the league. In contract, the Nuggets arent as good on an individual level, but they have Jokic that makes them work.</p>

<p>Seriously just watching the Nuggets without Jokic hurts.</p>

He couldn’t do it. Ant was destroying him. And while Jokic doesn’t mind pg duties when it makes sense- making that a MUST part of his job got him tired as hell. Combine that with complete MPJ collapse as well as Gordon in that last game… it was waaay too much for Jokic.</p>

      <label for="leqcsst" class="commentText"><p>People really underestimate how much basketball 82 games really is. Nuggets had to sprint to the finish line to try and keep ahead of the Wolves and Thunder, and then the Lakers played them tough.</p>

<p>This is why teams take parts of the regular season off, or coast to end the season if they can afford it. Celtics did it last year with a huge lead over the East, Nuggets did it the year before where no one was close to catching them except Memphis, Warriors did it in 2022 where they basically conceded the 2 seed to Memphis, LeBron has done it for a while now, the Heat regularly flip the switch in the playoffs after taking the regular season off, the 2016 Warriors chased a record and it cost them.</p>

<p>Don’t be surprised when some team goes all out or is in a tight race and really pushing to stay ahead and then fizzles out at some point in the playoffs because they too ran out of gas. Winning a championship is hard.</p>

      <label for="leqvs8c" class="commentText"><p>A big part of it is also that in a playoff series, the differential effect of Spoelstra&rsquo;s abilities to make adjustments in the focused context of a 7 game series over the opposing coach really shines. That sort of thing is not nearly as much of a factor in the regular season where teams play more of a constant style regardless of the opposition. So effectively, in the playoffs the Heat get a huge coaching buff which makes it seem like they&rsquo;re overachieving relative to their regular season play.</p>

<p>That’s also one of the reasons Ant looked so good against us, all of our guards besides Braun had fucked legs. He could just bully them without much recourse.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;90s-2010s might have made it look easier than it is but it&rsquo;s damn, damn hard to repeat as champions.</p>

<p>Thats the only way they are gonna develope. And throw them with Jokic more often and let the MPJ, AG and Jamal get more used to playing without him.</p>

      <label for="leqgn8i" class="commentText"><p>This is the butterfly effect of Wemby path and ascension to his GOAT material status, he stole that one game that would help them secure the 1st seed.</p>

<p>Yeah, tbf this came down to Booth/Malone. As someone who like Jokic, I followed the team closely.</p>

<p>Imo, in the <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>2023</sub> year after the ASB, the 2cnd best Nugget player was MPJ but Malone had a hardon with MPJ while he kept blaming for things that he didn’t do and he gave him a short leash.</p>

<p>I have the feeling, they didn’t run enough plays for MPJ this year when he was the biggest reason they had a great year. Murray tend to be cold, revert into tunnel vision and play hero ball for times to times while MPJ is sitting in the corner.</p>

<p>Booth is the biggest reason why they are in this mess, his comment during his interview with KOC really paint him as someone who was heavily invested in the rookies/picks/choice he made and it’s fine.</p>

<p>The thing is, he had shortsighted evaluation because it’s obvious that Jokic never had a good backup except DMC in 2022.</p>

<p>Now, they lost Bruce and it’s was impossible to retain but with comments like these, you know guy he didn’t went from him at the deadline. The new CBA is hitting, you got all these players that can’t do nothing the roster why don’t you just make a small trade for a backup PG better than Reggie or a backup center/forward better than DJ ?</p>

<p>Now, you add the fact KCP wife already denied the reports saying they’re offered a contract like the one he got in Orlando.</p>

<p>They’re a still a great team but the amount thinking they didn’t need Bruce and Brown/Watson would be able to help repeat was funny.</p>

      <label for="lequqc6" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, your comment shows that you didnt follow all the Lakers drama last season. They had a coach that absolutely refused to play his best starting line up for more than half the year. If he did, they would have been in the top 5 seeding. Not only that, but Jared Vanderbilt was injured a majority of the season and he&rsquo;s one of those impact players that could have easily made a difference. Oh, and they also had a injured Gabe Vincent that was desperately needed for his speed and defense.</p>
