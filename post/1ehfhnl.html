<p>The two of them proved how profitable wbb can be if marketed correctly. They found that female college athletes were some of the best influencers last year.</p>

<p>Now companies are gonna jump at the chance to work with Paige, Juju, Flaujae and HVL. All of which are very talented along with being beautiful and charismatic. They’re all social media darlings and guaranteed to be on tv. You honestly can’t do better as a company.</p>

<p>NIL is amazing for women athletes. The most popular college male athletes don’t stay in college very long, so it’s actually better for companies to go with the popular female college athlete.</p>

<p>The rise of Livvy Dunne is what made me realize this lol.  Like when had you ever heard anything about D1 gymnastics, suddenly one of the most popular college athletes is a gymnast doing stupid numbers on TikTok and Insta, taking in millions in endorsements, and bringing more attention to the sport and her teammates. NIL combined with a social media presence makes a lot of these smaller D1 sports viable money makers, where previously you probably had to be in the top 5% of athletes to make a career off it.</p>

      <label for="lfzbkwz" class="commentText"><p>Ok sure but it TRIPLED last year, that’s the Caitlin Clark effect. And nobody was calling 505k / game popular by any stretch, in fact I would say that was also Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese making waves in the college game upping interest in women’s basketball in general.</p>

      <label for="lfzwyen" class="commentText"><p>Clark is certainly a huge part of it. That being said I don’t know if it is completely fair to say they “lucked” into Clark, pretty much from the inception of the WNBA they have been trying to grow the brand among young girls so that they have better talent. It’s just an investment that is finally paying off.</p>

      <label for="lg1pmad" class="commentText"><p>They don&rsquo;t want to compete with the W</p>

<p>Right now, if you sign on for a league in Europe or China, you&rsquo;re playing basketball all year. The Chinese season is October-February, then playoffs in March/April. The W season is May-September, playoffs September/October.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of injury risk and no real offseason to recover/rehab/work on improving your skills.</p>

<p>This Unrivaled league is essentially like an extended March Madness/playoff vibe - intense competition for 8 weeks with a fast paced, 3x3 format.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how it&rsquo;ll work yet but I imagine it&rsquo;ll be something like &ldquo;buy a ticket, see 5 games, 20mins each, in one night featuring 30 of the best W players&rdquo;. Maybe it&rsquo;ll only be 3 games a night, idk the logistics and since this is the first year, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be a lot of troubleshooting.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also get to see teams stacked with players who are usually rivals.</p>

<p>Right now the 3x3 in the Olympics isn&rsquo;t representative of the best talent on either the men or women&rsquo;s side for the US (5x5 conflict, and FIBA rules make it so you have to get a certain amount of points to even qualify which is why you can&rsquo;t just treat it as &ldquo;oh Brunson and Jaylen Brown, you didn&rsquo;t make the 5x5 team, go win gold playing 3x3&rdquo;), but it can be a really fun competition when you have the talent.</p>

      <label for="lfz3lrw" class="commentText"><p>Might be thinking more globally as many of the pro wnba players play overseas. Perhaps mirror how the NBA is the best basketball league and make this the best 3s league and translate directly to FIBA 3x3.</p>

<p>I think Caitlyn Clark is a real wake up call for the wnba players about marketing and tv deals driving salaries. They probably felt overall improvement of talent and fan growth over time would do it, but it’s not enough. NBA needed Bird and Magic, the wnba needs Clark. But there is probably worry about her being a flash in the pan.</p>

<p>This league looks like it’s trying to take a shortcut domestically and capitalize on the most marketable women players out the gate, but also perhaps take an immediate global approach for additional sponsorship opportunities and broadcasting rights.</p>

      <label for="lfzcycg" class="commentText"><p>Correct. Just to clarify, Bird and Magic are considered important for the nba beyond their talents. It was how they were marketed as opposites from college into the pros. Media could drive a narrative throughout their careers that boosted the hell out of nba ratings. This is what drives salaries moving forward. The best women players weren’t doing that. There’s plenty of blame to go around in the sense of failure to market wnba stars, but the reality right now is Clark is driving views and the new tv deal (also arguably undervalued).</p>

<p>Collier and Stewart also probably that. They got Reese, who has been pushed heavily by the wnba, just need to sign Clark. They are putting a lot of their own money into this, but they also now have a good sense of what they need to keep the money rolling in.</p>

<p>Imagine if the ABA came back and gave Wemby 25% of a franchise to play 30 games during the summer. Not happening.</p>

<p>I think it is highly likely that there will be a non-compete clause in the next WNBA or NBA CBA to address this. Players will want to do it, and owners will not want them to be able to own stake. Playing in another league is one thing, owning is probably a step too far for the NBA to be happy about.</p>

<p>This league was created by WNBA players to give them a chance to make money during the offseason while staying home in the US. Since it’s purely an offseason league, it shouldn’t conflict with the W.</p>

<p>WNBA usually supports leagues that keep players from going overseas in the offseason particularly bc the prioritization rule just went into effect and AU &amp; Unrivaled don&rsquo;t overlap with the W season</p>

<p>Maya is greatness, don’t get me wrong. But she had holes in her offensive game that Taurasi didn’t have, and she didn’t have Taurasi’s ability to carry a team.</p>

<p>Stewie is the same way.</p>

<p>They both won a lot, but they felt very little pressure because they always had a beyond dominant team. The second the pressure was there, they’d fold.</p>

<p>Taurasi has this thing about her, (probably not as much at 42, but for most of her career) where if her team could at all compete, they were going to win. She lost a “winner goes on, loser goes home” game as a freshman in the ncaa tournament - then didn’t lose one again for 20 years.</p>

<p>She’s just one of the greatest winners ever.</p>

<p>People say that, but baseball and softball seem to work out just fine with slightly different rules and fields for men and women.</p>

<p>Volleyball is also a teeny bit different between sexes.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t forget, women play with a smaller ball in basketball already</p>

<p>they can dunk on the 10 foot rim, so it can&rsquo;t be lowered.  plus FG% would go through the roof.</p>
