      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1drhgpn/over_roughly_the_first_half_of_his_career_from/"><p>Over roughly the first half of his career, from 1984-1992, John Stocktonn had more assists than 3x assist champ Rajon Rondo had in his 16 year career (Rondo ranks 15th all-time). From 1993-2003, he also had more than Rondo</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This would also be true for the 15 year ongoing career of 2x assist champ James Harden, who currently ranks 14th</p>

<p>Rondo is one of my favorite players to watch of all time, just meant to show how ridiculously unbeatable Stockton’s assist record is.</p>

<p>However, his steals record is close to as unbreakable, and the 21 year career of LeBron is a good example.</p>

<p>In an 11 year stretch, Stockton had more assists than LeBron (4th all time) has had in his career, and just shy of as many steals as LeBron (8th all time). Stockton also played another eight years at a high level and only missed a game in one of them.</p>

<p>All-time steals leaders: <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/history/leaders/_/stat/steals" target="_blank">https://www.espn.com/nba/history/leaders/_/stat/steals</a></p>

<p>As you can see, LeBron has accumulated 11,009 assists and 2,275 steals.</p>

<p>Stockton assists over 11-year stretch: (11,145)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=john+stockton+total+assists+1986-87+to+1996-97" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=john+stockton+total+assists+1986-87+to+1996-97</a></p>

<p>Stockton steals over 11 year stretch: (2,265)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=john+stockton+total+steals+1986-87+to+1996-97" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=john+stockton+total+steals+1986-87+to+1996-97</a></p>

<p>Getting ahead of it- John Stockton is not better than LeBron James, he was really good at getting assists and steals</p>

<p>John Stockton is an anti-vaxx conspiracy theorist (think that’s the reason I had to spell his name wrong in the title)- he was really good at getting assists and steals</p>

<p>(8.2 on the road)</p>

<p>Maybe some of that is home cooking, but it would also make sense for players to have a little more success playing at home in the same way that teams do</p>

<p>Anybody who’s ever studied the film also notes how fortunate he was to play with Karl Malone who was one of the greatest scorers of all time. The Jazz really took a leap as a team when Malone hit his prime in 1990, not when Stockton put up the same season over and over again.</p>

<p>His assist record says more about his durability than anything else, but Nash/Magic/Lebron/Jokic found more valuable passes FAR more often that nobody else could.</p>

<p>Edit: the thinking basketball guy does some great analysis on a lot of stuff but I blame him for some of the discourse about pre-ACL tear Rondo. Look at some of his best highlights from the regular season or his duels with LeBron in the playoffs. He was an elite playmaker who tricked defenses and controlled the game</p>

      <label for="lavd3d0" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, the acl changed everything for him which to the point of rondo when it’s mentioned he played 16 years, he was a shell in like half of those 15. So he really had a strong stretch for half and to be ranked 15 is crazy</p>

      <label for="lav9otq" class="commentText"><p>My point is that Rondo is 15th all-time in assists, and Stockton had more than twice as much. Only three NBA players ever (Kidd, CP3, LeBron) have had <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> as many. That and the LeBron stat are just ways to show how unreachable the record is</p>
