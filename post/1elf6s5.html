</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From the UK and I&rsquo;ve been following basketball casually for a couple years now, football for me has been declining during that time and while I was previously a fanatic I barely find myself watching matches now, I think the game has become too robotic etc etc. Following the NBA vaguely for a couple years now despite what some people say about the finals the league looks like a really fast paced, competitive sport loaded with talent.</p>

<p>Timezones seem to be an issue, I stay up until 6 usually on the weekends to hack American UFC times and I really don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m able to do that sport of thing day in and out for basketball. Not sure how this affects who I might choose to support, if its 1am sort of times I might be alright but I generally have to get up at 6am for work.</p>

<p>Watching basketball this olympics has been a good insight I think into how the sport is right now. I&rsquo;m kind of making this post to wonder if anyone can give me any pointers or brush up any concerns I might have or why they support their team (outside of just being local) or even just ask some questions to someone about the NBA from an outside perspective</p>

      <label for="lgr76yp" class="commentText"><p>What club do you support in the prem so I can see if there’s an nba team that has a similar play-style or mindset?</p>

<p>If you pick an Eastern team the games will usually start at 8PM EST which translates to 1AM UK time. For Western teams it’ll be 8PM PST to 4AM UK time.</p>

<p>Also based on your post I’m assuming your against the bald fraud and his 115 charges</p>

      <label for="lgr871j" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;d be right on the last part. Don&rsquo;t support a prem team, Dad grew up in Stoke so I&rsquo;ve tried to bare watching the worst anti-football for my whole life, no team is really local to me (local is in national league and I own a season ticket) so more or less I just watch the prem in and out ubiquitously. I think the Spurs look like a good team to follow, Wemby hype aside they&rsquo;re one of the most philosophically sound and winning teams of the last 20-25 years, I think Tim Duncan exemplifies that kind of winning culture and embodies the club itself and is a big reason I&rsquo;ve kind of liked that team, not too sure about their playstyle but they look even now like a team with a vision and a fun rise up</p>

      <label for="lgra6ob" class="commentText"><p>The spurs are a no nonsense fundamentalist type of team historically. It won’t be sexy but they’ll get the job done. The last few years have been a bit down for them but thanks to Wemby and their smart asset management they’re on the come up and should be a lower mid table team.</p>

<p>Teams I’d suggest that are also in the west are the Rockets or Timberwolves. They’re both young team with a defensive coach but good young offensive talent that are exciting to watch. Rockets are in a similar position as the Spurs but the Timberwolves are in a win now situation.</p>

<p>Watch some highlights of their season of those 3 teams and then I say pick whichever team you enjoyed watching the most.</p>

      <label for="lgrbzmq" class="commentText"><p>We actually have 3 time zones but i get your point.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking bout an eastern team your options are more limited cause there’s allot of bad teams here. The teams I’d suggest are Pacers, Magic, or Heat. Pacers are a young and very high paced offense but ok to sub par defense, meanwhile the Magic and Heat are both young teams with elite defense but a mediocre offense.</p>

<p>On the eastern coastline it’s a 5 hour difference from y’all tho just so you know. Just wanted to name a few teams from both conferences so you can see which you like and is easier for your schedule. Also if you pick a team in California like say the Lakers or Kings it’s be an 8 hour difference fyi</p>

<p>I recommend a few things to follow the league (I&rsquo;m also in the UK). YouTube has several channels that produce ten minute summaries of all games within hours of them being played. If you know the Spurs played the Mavs for example, just search for &lsquo;Spurs Mavs Highlights&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll find it.</p>

<p>If you can spare about £100 a year (I think the annual cost hasn&rsquo;t been announced yet), NBA League Pass is actually brilliant for those of us not in the US. You get to see all the games on demand, the app on Google/Android TVs and Apple/Xbox whatever your streaming device may be works pretty well. (I tend to use Xbox, it is less prone to weird UI errors compared to direct from telly).</p>

<p>We actually have a pretty fun competition in the UK, the BBL has gone bust, but the restart is pretty much guaranteed. Check out <a href="http://britishbasketballleague.co.uk" target="_blank">britishbasketballleague.co.uk</a> for the teams and locations (mind, that URL will probably change with the restart).</p>

<p>EuroLeague is also fun to follow. They too have a &lsquo;League Pass&rsquo; (<a href="https://tv.euroleague.net/" target="_blank">https://tv.euroleague.net/</a>) which is even cheaper, but there&rsquo;s fewer games.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s certain podcasts that will really help you keep track of what is going on. It&rsquo;s a big league with lots of events etc. I personally listen to lots of them because I&rsquo;m an NBA nutter, but begin with LockedOn NBA, which is generally one of the better &lsquo;dailies&rsquo; without getting too technical. Dunc&rsquo;d On is also great, but they&rsquo;ve switched to a hybrid free/subscription model and the subscription is more expensive than League Pass&hellip; (Eugh!)</p>

<p>This sub is pretty good for &lsquo;the latest news&rsquo;. r/nbadiscussion is for more in-depth content.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to influence who you should follow. The Spurs are a fun team and I&rsquo;m pleased you landed on one of the small-market teams, no need for glory hunting!</p>

Then you can pick your own viewing schedule based on teams, players and match ups you want to see. This sub will provide the best plays and box scores (player stats). I unsubscribe during the season so I don&rsquo;t get spoilers, then check in once I&rsquo;ve seen the game/s I want.</p>

      <label for="lgr8yq5" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a streameast/crackstreams warrior brother (don&rsquo;t know if you can mention them here), broadcasting is a non issue for me. I think you&rsquo;re right on just watching it casually for a bit before I get a feel for one of the teams, being on here and NBA twitter kind of provides another reason to be interested. Most sports I feel like half of the interest is because of the whole soap opera around it, games can be shit sometimes but it&rsquo;s all the discussion, transfers, news, narratives, players and personalities that make the sport interesting</p>

      <label for="lgra6f5" class="commentText"><p>Then there will be plenty of podcasts too 🙂 I like the Hoop Collective, which is serious but humourous. Then The Lowe Post is good for in depth, tactical stuff I semi-understand. The latter especially has rumours, fake trades, hypotheticals. Basketball can be a true rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to follow a team, you&rsquo;ll learn who&rsquo;s fun to watch and high scoring. If you do, maybe go for somewhere with direct, not too expensive flights in case you want to go (NY, San Fran, Miami, Orlando, LA, Boston).</p>

<p>You might want to pick a West Coast team. Most of their weekday games tip off around 03:30 your time (varies a bit) and just about wrap up by your normal wakeup time.</p>
