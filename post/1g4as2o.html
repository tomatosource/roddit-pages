I have degenerative discs in my back and its a part time job to keep the pain at bay and a friend has a degenerative eye condition that will slowly leave her blind in her early 30s. And to quote Baz Luhrmann, &ldquo;take care of your knees, youll miss them when theyre gone&rdquo;. Hopefully Leonard can get a transplant or something so he can enjoy his life even if its not as a pro athlete.</p>

      <label for="ls2cvjl" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I don&rsquo;t really blame people for being uninformed on this one.</p>

<p>To me, Kawhi&rsquo;s camp believes their prerogative is to not publicly acknowledge the full extent of his condition. Idk if that should be the case, but it&rsquo;s where we are and I really can&rsquo;t blame fans when there&rsquo;s a genuine lack of reporting on this topic.</p>

<p>And if there is a report that confirms the degenerative condition, I would love to see it. I&rsquo;ve occasionally checked over the span of about 6 years now and the only place I&rsquo;ve seen it stated as a fact is here on reddit.</p>

      <label for="ls2gbiy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, their goal during the Spurs saga was definitely to hide his condition and try to get him to LA. They’ve weighed the options of what looks worse: that people think he’s a pussy or people think he can’t play. Really, the first one doesn’t mean shit because that’s for fans. The second one affects his contract so they’d rather you think he’s a weird guy instead of knowing that his knee is fucked and has been for like 6 years. And it worked. The first Clips contract is fine, I get it. This one? They clearly don’t care about the basketball product and just want a big name Star as the face of the team for branding purposes.</p>

      <label for="ls28ol0" class="commentText"><p>It’s because of the expectations based on Kawhi’s contract and production. Leonard plays great and plays more games when he’s in a contract year or in an extension eligible year. He then signs a massive deal and then often has a down year.</p>

<p>So fans witness an outstanding performance year, happily see their team give him a big contract, and then are disappointed for a couple years until it all repeats again.</p>

<p>If Kawhi happened to stack his productive years early on in contracts, then performed less well in contract years then he’d get paid significantly less and would consistently outplay his contract value and fans would be happy. He would exceed expectations and provide excess value to the team. Instead he does the more lucrative and more fan frustrating pattern of signing big deals and then underperforming the contract until he’s up for another deal again.</p>

<p>From a fan perspective, at a certain point it just doesn’t matter if he’s got a degenerative condition or is just the mother of all Trevor Ariza’s, who play exceptionally well in contract years. The results are the same.</p>

<p>Neither are good contracts.</p>

<p>Beal is a bit redundant in the Suns. They&rsquo;d rather have a star wing.</p>

<p>Suns can survive the regular season with Kawhi load managing.</p>

<p>Hopefully Beal agrees (he has NTC) because he wants to live in LA.</p>

      <label for="ls2a8o9" class="commentText"><p>I really think his knees are in such bad shape that if Kawhi just came to the clippers and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too injured to play&rdquo; for the next three years, you wouldn&rsquo;t find a doctor in the world who would contest that.  And its been that way for awhile.  So it really just becomes a question of how badly he wants to play vs. sit around in street clothes and collect $50 mil for the next three years (for clarity, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll do that, but he could).</p>
