      <label for="llgrw7p" class="commentText"><p>David Stern installed a strict dress in 2005.</p>

<p>It was largely a reaction to the Malice at the Palace. </p>

<p>Allen Iverson was hugely popular and a cultural icon beyond basketball. He embodied the hip hop/street wear image. Corn rows, tattoos, baggy pants, chains, durags, etc. This type of fashion was labeled as “thugs” and has crazy racial undertones.</p>

<p>Stern wanted to “clean up” the image, keeping the game marketable to more conservative Americans. Made everybody show up in suit and tie. </p>

<p>Funnily, the fashion was still a product of the time and we have the pile of oversized, baggy suite pictures to look back on.</p>

<p>It started before him with the fan five.  Their baggies and urban style caused a huge controversy in the early 90s, and then AI ratcheted it up to another level with cornrows and tats.</p>

      <label for="llhxdgv" class="commentText"><p>Younger people need to understand. Inner city hip-hop culture, was still brand new or foreign (scary) to 90 percent of America. Although inspired by the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s, it was radically different from what the older generation was used to.</p>

<p>It was also associated with a lot of inner city violence that ravaged big American cities in the late 80&rsquo;s to mid 90&rsquo;s. There were 2,245 murders in New York City in 1990. Between 1985 and 1992 NYC alone had over 18,000 murders.</p>

<p>You combine this incorrect association and ignorance of the culture with a little bit of racism, and you had a lot of old people mad about how young people were dressing and acting.</p>

      <label for="llhw560" class="commentText"><p>You think nba players are fashionable because Stern made their predecessors wear suits? I totally disagree. I think Stern wanted to take the spotlight away from what the players were wearing before and after games because he thought it was alienating the fan base. Guys like Iverson pushed back and I think the individualism that is embodied in today’s nba culture came from him - not Stern’s mandate.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s Donald Sterling &ldquo;&ldquo;It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you&rsquo;re associating with black people. You can sleep with [black people].

<p>That said, we&rsquo;ll never know what Stern had said behind closed doors. There&rsquo;s clearly a toxic environment in the NBA if Sterling felt comfortable enough to say those words or even have those thoughts.</p>

      <label for="llh5ila" class="commentText"><p>Sterling didn&rsquo;t say those words to the NBA, but to his girlfriend in private. Huge difference. And Sterling was always the black sheep of NBA owners, but since they are the NBA, there is nothing much you can do.</p>

<p>Never forget, Stern and Silver work for Sterling and Balmer, not the other way around.</p>

In Europe, this era marked a significant change as we witnessed the emergence of African-American professionals and athletes achieving success in various fields.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The behavior of wealthy athletes, often portrayed as businessmen, had a profound impact on many people. Some might argue that this shift was excessive, but for those who had limited access to NBA coverage, it was truly inspiring.

<p>Players would just come to games in sweats and baggy shirts, and with the new rule they had to up their game and look more professional.</p>

<p>Thus opened up their fashion for players like Russ, Harden, etc. to really experiment and make the tunnel entrance a part of the NBA’s allure.</p>

<p>Fashion went from the 50 cent era to a more quirky era and it&rsquo;s not like Russ is THE driving force imo.  Same goes for Rodman and his outfits. Rodman was way more &ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; considering the conservative era he played in.</p>

<p>There have always been outliers, and fashion is just evolving into different directions. The baggy clothes were a 2000s thing. Just because it&rsquo;s not fashionable to you, it was back then.</p>

<p>Since the league isn&rsquo;t dealing with media and public calling their players &ldquo;thugs&rdquo;, I think the league sees it as being fine laxing a policy.</p>

You gotta remember after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> during Bush’s second run in 2004, the country was much more conservative (bush enjoyed nearly 80 pct approval ratings). You also had the rise of “thug” culture in the nba which is racist as f”ck but that’s what they called it. It was a counter culture to the conservative culture that was taking over.</p>

<p>I think stern was trying to align the nba with the way the country was to attract a larger fan base.</p>

<p>Not only were strict dress codes in place but you got automatic suspensions for pot and getting caught more than once got you the boot from the league entirely.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today and the culture of our country has basically done a 180. So it makes sense silver dropped any sort of dress code and guys like Kevin Durant can show up to a meeting about weed with Adam silver while baked as fuck and reeking like it.</p>

At least early on in the mid-2000s. Conversation around it went mostly about how your expect, older people &ldquo;raised the right way&rdquo;, etc., telling the players to suck it up and deal with it, but most people not caring one way or the other. I remember my mom being confused why players on the bench were in suits at a basketball game.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a big deal in the sense that it didn&rsquo;t actually matter much in the grand scheme of things and didn&rsquo;t really change any image/perception of the league imo.</p>

      <label for="llhhydu" class="commentText"><p>“Cleaning up the league’s image” is not the phrase you want to remember about this time period. That is a dated understanding in my view. I think it’s more accurate to say Stern was trying to market the league to the audience of the past rather than to the audience of the future. It would be incomprehensible for white people to be told they need to stop dressing and acting the way they were born and raised because we’re embarrassing the black folk with our whiteness.</p>

<p>Guys like allen iverson are trailblazers. He came from nothing but he was doing something… literally the American dream. Look how much the league has grown  in terms of revenue since the 90s and it’s largely because the new commissioner embraced the fact that basketball is for everyone</p>
