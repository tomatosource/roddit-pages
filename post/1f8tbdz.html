<p>It was largely a reaction to the Malice at the Palace. </p>

<p>Allen Iverson was hugely popular and a cultural icon beyond basketball. He embodied the hip hop/street wear image. Corn rows, tattoos, baggy pants, chains, durags, etc. This type of fashion was labeled as “thugs” and has crazy racial undertones.</p>

<p>Stern wanted to “clean up” the image, keeping the game marketable to more conservative Americans. Made everybody show up in suit and tie. </p>

<p>Funnily, the fashion was still a product of the time and we have the pile of oversized, baggy suite pictures to look back on.</p>

<p>It started before him with the fab five.  Their baggies and urban style caused a huge controversy in the early 90s, and then AI ratcheted it up to another level with cornrows and tats.</p>

Although inspired by the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s, it was radically different from what the older generation was used to.</p>

<p>It was also associated with a lot of inner city violence that ravaged big American cities in the late 80&rsquo;s to mid 90&rsquo;s. There were 2,245 murders in New York City in 1990. Between 1985 and 1992 NYC alone had over 18,000 murders.</p>

<p>You combine this incorrect association and ignorance of the culture with a little bit of racism, and you had a lot of old people mad about how young people were dressing and acting.</p>

<p>Ironically, one of the dress code&rsquo;s biggest opponents was Tim Duncan, who was just about the most straight-laced, normcore, non-&ldquo;thuggish&rdquo; guy in the entire league.</p>

<p>Duncan&rsquo;s an islander, he&rsquo;d show up to games in board shorts and flip flops if he could. IIRC he&rsquo;s never worn a tie in his life, even on trips to the White House after winning a title. His pre-dress code street clothes usually consisted of a big sweater and baggy jeans, looking like he had just finished playing Wonderwall on the guitar in the quad of any college ever.</p>

<p>Nash was another anti-dress code guy. His street clothes were always a zip hoodie over a t-shirt with ripped jeans. He always looked like he&rsquo;d been laying on the couch playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater all afternoon.</p>

      <label for="lljfxrp" class="commentText"><p>It didn&rsquo;t lead to that, NBA players were already trend-setting fashion icons before the dress code. It was just fashion that you, depending on your age, might not like.</p>

<p>Jordan was the most famous NBA fashion icon - not just for the shoes, but also the baggy shorts and shaved head. Almost nobody purposely shaved their head bald before Jordan - doing that got you called &ldquo;Kojak&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cueball&rdquo; all day.</p>

<p>And baggy shorts are <em>still</em> the fashion today. Maybe not to the same degree as the And-1 era, but nobody in America is rocking pre-Jordan, <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>-style nuthuggers.</p>

<p>Even in the so-called dark ages of the 1970s. You&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find any current NBA player who can match fashion icon status with Dr J or Clyde Frazier.</p>

      <label for="lliitrp" class="commentText"><p>“And so, yeah, they pushed back. Some people was taking the fines early on, but eventually, people started wearing suits. And I think one of the big stars at the time was Kobe Bryant. And he really embraced suits for - there was a while when Kobe was wearing all Tom Ford suits and really, really impeccable tailoring. I really admired his shift to that. But yeah. And then, you know, the younger guys came in being now the elder statesmen - LeBron, D Wade, Chris Paul - and by the time they got in there and started wearing the suits, it started loosening up a little bit.”</p>

<p>- Mitchell S. Jackson , author of &ldquo;Fly: The Big Book Of Basketball Fashion</p>

<p>I think Westbrook and Carmelo as well for that timeframe/generation. Guys wearing tailored, high end designer clothes. Lots of checkered patterns and different colors. I don’t know who all pushed for the more fashion house looks seen today, or when the NBA relaxed the code. I assume Adam Silver allowed it to be dialed back. </p>

      <label for="llhw560" class="commentText"><p>You think nba players are fashionable because Stern made their predecessors wear suits? I totally disagree. I think Stern wanted to take the spotlight away from what the players were wearing before and after games because he thought it was alienating the fan base. Guys like Iverson pushed back and I think the individualism that is embodied in today’s nba culture came from him - not Stern’s mandate.</p>

Black people really are creative with fashion (and most arts), and their overcoming of Stern’s racist policy is incredibly inspiring and typical of their strength. Sad to see so many racist “wypipo” downvoting - it’s giving Boston fans 🤣  You’re preaching!</p>

<p>As soon as they relaxed the rules in the bubble, all the coaches went from wearing suit and tie to track suits and hoodies, and they haven&rsquo;t gone back.</p>

<p>Yeah, but was that change done as hilariously as Bill Belichick?</p>

<p>(Belichick wanted to wear suits on the sideline like NFL coaches did in the 60s. The NFL said no, he could only wear official Reebok NFL apparel - at the time, most coaches wore windbreakers. So he cut the neck and sleeves off of hoodies to make the NFL&rsquo;s &ldquo;official apparel&rdquo; look as shitty as possible.)</p>

<p>Players would just come to games in sweats and baggy shirts, and with the new rule they had to up their game and look more professional.</p>

<p>Thus opened up their fashion for players like Russ, Harden, etc. to really experiment and make the tunnel entrance a part of the NBA’s allure.</p>

<p>Fashion went from the 50 cent era to a more quirky era and it&rsquo;s not like Russ is THE driving force imo.  Same goes for Rodman and his outfits. Rodman was way more &ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; considering the conservative era he played in.</p>

<p>There have always been outliers, and fashion is just evolving into different directions. The baggy clothes were a 2000s thing. Just because it&rsquo;s not fashionable to you, it was back then.</p>

<p>Since the league isn&rsquo;t dealing with media and public calling their players &ldquo;thugs&rdquo;, I think the league sees it as being fine laxing a policy.</p>

<p>It was more about class than race. Stern wanted the league to appeal to rich people. That&rsquo;s why his dress code also banned Duncan from wearing flip-flops and Nash from wearing hoodies, even though nobody considered those guys &ldquo;thuggish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything Stern did was about money. He didn&rsquo;t give a shit about violence - he was in the stands for the Heat-Knicks fight - until Malice at the Palace threatened the league&rsquo;s money.</p>

<p>Money</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Race for Stern, always. He moved a team from SEA to OKC, even though SEA is whiter, because OKC was willing to cater to rich people by paying for luxury skyboxes in the stadium and SEA wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How about the playoff series that Stern allegedly tilted?</p>

<p>2002: the Lakers were more black-coded than the Kings, but Stern knows G7 = $$$$$. So the Lakers, who featured 0 white players (other than Mark Madsen dancing at parades and maybe some Slava in garbage time), got a friendly whistle against the Kings who had 2 white starters (Vlade, Peja) and 2 white key bench guys (Hedo, Pollard).</p>

<p>2001: same thing with Sixers-Bucks in 01. I mean, PHI had Iverson himself, the guy Stern was supposedly most racist against. Yet PHI gets a kind whistle and the series goes 7 (and PHI wins). Because G7 = $$$$, and the only color Stern saw was green.</p>

<p>Granted, you also have 07 which doesn&rsquo;t fit. On the one hand, helping SA over PHX isn&rsquo;t good for business. On the other hand, helping SA pretty much eliminated the chance of the first white MVP in 20 years of making the Finals.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not what Stern wanted, though. Stern wanted to make them more marketable to rich people.</p>

<p>Stern was a classist. He was there when the league was considered for the poors, and he wanted it to be for the rich.</p>

<p>For example, Seattle&rsquo;s stadium didn&rsquo;t have enough private boxes for Stern&rsquo;s liking. Are private boxes at stadiums racist? No, but they&rsquo;re 100% classist.</p>

<p>Heck, Seattle is whiter than OKC. Stern didn&rsquo;t give a shit about race. He was pissed because SEA wouldn&rsquo;t cater to the rich like Stern wanted them too - but OKC did.</p>

<p>Therefore, the league loses out on money. Stern isn’t a racist for that, he’s just smart and gave a league of mostly black men tons of money by expanding the nba market (opposite of racism).</p>

I think it’s more accurate to say Stern was trying to market the league to the audience of the past rather than to the audience of the future. It would be incomprehensible for white people to be told they need to stop dressing and acting the way they were born and raised because we’re embarrassing the black folk with our whiteness.</p>

<p>Guys like allen iverson are trailblazers. He came from nothing but he was doing something… literally the American dream. Look how much the league has grown  in terms of revenue since the 90s and it’s largely because the new commissioner embraced the fact that basketball is for everyone</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a big deal in the sense that it didn&rsquo;t actually matter much in the grand scheme of things and didn&rsquo;t really change any image/perception of the league imo.</p>

      <label for="llhr9yy" class="commentText"><p>A lot of cultural things were happening at this time. You gotta remember after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> during Bush’s second run in 2004, the country was much more conservative (bush enjoyed nearly 80 pct approval ratings). You also had the rise of “thug” culture in the nba which is racist as f”ck but that’s what they called it. It was a counter culture to the conservative culture that was taking over.</p>

<p>I think stern was trying to align the nba with the way the country was to attract a larger fan base.</p>

<p>Not only were strict dress codes in place but you got automatic suspensions for pot and getting caught more than once got you the boot from the league entirely.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today and the culture of our country has basically done a 180. So it makes sense silver dropped any sort of dress code and guys like Kevin Durant can show up to a meeting about weed with Adam silver while baked as fuck and reeking like it.</p>
