      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fa8bl7/do_you_think_portland_should_have_broken_up_dame/"><p>Do you think Portland should have broken up Dame and CJ earlier than they did?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Im a Blazers fan and I think the answer is yes and we should have done it a lot earlier. I always thought the Dame/CJ back court was fun to watch but we were never getting out of the West with the Splash Brothers.</p>

<p>The <sup>2016</sup>&frasl;<sub>2017</sub> season is an interesting one. The keys have well and truly been given to Dame post LA. CJ is coming off winning the most MIP and while Portland signed role players like Turner, Harkless and Crabbe to deals they still have some cap flexibility.</p>

<p>In hindsight would it not have been better to deal CJ back then and try to pair Dame with another star?</p>

<p>This was also a time a lot of players were moving around. With players like Boogie, Paul George and Jimmy Butler all being traded in 2017 should the Blazers have considered trading CJ?</p>

      <label for="llr9ksk" class="commentText"><p>I think Portland&rsquo;s fate was sealed when Wes Matthews tore his Achilles.  That 2015 team was actually good.  They were 41-19 when he went down, the last Portland team to be &ldquo;elite&rdquo; by Phil Jackson&rsquo;s definition.</p>

<p>Once he went down, the team seemed to fall apart.  Then Aldridge left in free agency and Olshey screwed up the rest of the roster.</p>

Unless you are a team with guaranteed income (Lakers, Bulls) or have an organization that has garnered enough public trust to go through a rebuild (Spurs), you&rsquo;re going to be losing a lot of money. Teardowns will only happen if the owner approves and/or the situation forces it (Nets). You&rsquo;re more likely to end on the Pistons&rsquo; side of a rebuild over an OKC result.</p>

<p>OKC did exact what &ldquo;kids on this sub&rdquo; and you are describing and gently benefitted from it. They trade all their star players for assets and are thriving.</p>

<p>They are also considered one of the best ran organizations in the league, while the team that never blows it up (bulls), is one of the worst ran organizations.</p>

<p>As it turns out, kids on 2k might know a thing or two.</p>

<p>The Pistons have gotten extremely unlucky. outside of Cade they always got an unfavorable draft position and lower picks than their record. Plus they never blew up a team and traded for extra 1st round picks anyway. The Rockets are another team in great position after trading Harden, whereas teams like Portland, Chicago, and until very recently Sacramento have consistently been the worst teams for a decade because they refuse to blow up teams.</p>

They made the WCF because they just so happened to be on the right side of the bracket to avoid the Warriors and Rockets. They stood no chance against the best teams in the playoffs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not respectable when there are 5-7 teams that could win a championship and they never been one of those teams.</p>

<p>This is such a dork ass blog boy way to view the sport of basketball. Meaningful hoops happens outside of only title games. The Blazers have been a good team for the last decade outside of blowing it up, better than a lot of other teams. No one cares about your arbitrary classifications of what is actually good and what is not.</p>

If the Blazers were so good barely making the playoffs why did their coach get fired? Because it was a failure. Different teams have different expectations. If the Bulls made the playoffs this year it would be a success and the coach would get coach of the year and an extension. But you can&rsquo;t  not progress as a team for a decade with no hope and expect to get applauded.</p>

      <label for="lltw6v2" class="commentText"><p>Again, you&rsquo;re not a team owner, owners have more to consider than just gunho shooting for a championship once a decade.  Even today the Rockets don&rsquo;t sell nearly as much merch and they haven&rsquo;t consistently sold out the Toyota Center since 2019.  The Rockets are by all financial measures worse off than they were with Harden in 2019.  As a fan you can say oh who cares the rebuild means we have a good young core so I&rsquo;ll take it. But from the ownership perspective they just lost 5 years worth of peak revenue, and the drought is still ongoing Jalen Green is not out there selling jerseys it&rsquo;s gonna be a HOT minute before the Rockets recoup the missed value of having Harden in their city for a few extra years.</p>

If the fans weren&rsquo;t selling out for a young team that almost made the playoffs, they are poor fans. Jalen Green is one of the most exciting players to watch and so is Sengun.</p>

But to the important people and the owners it&rsquo;s sometimes the only relevant indicator of success.   Cause I can tell you right now, Fertitta could give less of a shit about Jalen Green or Sengun, when he bought the team he bought it for Harden and the money he would generate, he sure as shit wasn&rsquo;t spending 2.2 billion for a &ldquo;young core&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lly8zea" class="commentText"><p>yeah agreed portland is a small market in NBA terms, so getting a team that competes for the playoffs year after year is the best way to be profitable and keep fans engaged. it’s not about “going for broke” like a video game.</p>

<p>it’s why i laugh when year after year for the past ten years people are like oh they should break up the pacers. rebuilding on the fly is kind of what they do, it’s usually not a champ team but it’s good for making the playoffs and making money and keeping fans engaged which are all good things. Haliburton/Pascal combo is unlikely to win a title, but they’ll make the playoffs every year where they’re both healthy and that’s really
important for a small market team.</p>

      <label for="llr9mg0" class="commentText"><p>If this was a video game, then yeah they should have.</p>

<p>But in the real world? Firstly, I think they were hoping LMA would hang around, and their biggest mistake might have actually not trying to trade him with a year left.</p>

<p>But once LMA was gone and it was clear Dame was their franchise player? You then don&rsquo;t trade a player like Dame until he asks out. And you don&rsquo;t trade his teammate like CJ until Dame is ok with it.</p>

<p>In some organisations/markets/FO&rsquo;s you can get away with that because you can sell to Dame that he just needs to trust the organisation knows what they are doing, and you can also then manage it if he pushes out, but I&rsquo;m not sure if Portland was in that kind of position.</p>

<p>Lillard (6&rsquo;2&rdquo;) and CJ (6&rsquo;3&rdquo;) had 52 wins and had that odd WCF run like you said.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s the smartest thing to be undersized, but it is possible to be good. Difference is, Bradley and Smart played defense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d bet if you put Bradley or Smart onto Lillard&rsquo;s team, they&rsquo;d have been better than with CJ. Still not elite, because the team wasn&rsquo;t amazing, but better.</p>

      <label for="llr9xbp" class="commentText"><p>I don’t understand why Neil Olshey had such a hard on for CJ. He should’ve traded him when his value was high after they got swept by the Pelicans. When similar teams around that time like OKC and Minnesota were able to get PG and Jimmy respectively what was his excuse? Four starters leaving in 2015, the god awful 2016 free agency, the trash 2017 draft picks and the 2018 playoffs forever cemented Dame would never win a ring in Portland</p>

      <label for="llrckik" class="commentText"><p>Portland was in a position where they could put out a competitive team, make it to the playoffs every year if Dame/CJ/Nurk were healthy and get 2-8 additional home games every season on top of the fan fair of being a competitive team. I don&rsquo;t think trading away CJ could have made the team title contenders,, they would have had to go into rebuild mode unless they did some trade in 2017 for PG or something. From an ownership perspective, keeping CJ was probably the correct move. They made the playoffs every year with him as their 2nd option. It&rsquo;s not always championship or bust, sometimes putting together a competitive team that your fans can enjoy is still a win and good for business.</p>

      <label for="llr96ev" class="commentText"><p>Just my opinion, the problem was never the fit between CJ and Dame. The problem was twofold.</p>

<p>One: Dame just isn&rsquo;t as good as people think. All his advanced metrics suggest he&rsquo;s in the correct role in the Bucks. Secondary scorer and lead ball handler, on a team with good defenders. Dame&rsquo;s belief that he was ever a franchise player, number one option type guy, and Portland fans seemingly universal belief that he is or was, and his supermax contract, are the reason it was impossible to win much.</p>

<p>Two: It does not help matters that after LMA left town, you guys basically never got another decent PF, or wing for that matter. Al Faruq Aminu, Grant&hellip; All the various bums the Blazers tried to get to play the three and the four&hellip; It&rsquo;s just been a dumpster fire. They never really had a starting caliber three or four.</p>

<p>The Blazers fans, and organization, did a super common thing among small market team fans and organizations: They blamed everything on the second best player. Is the problem that Dame isn&rsquo;t a good defender? Is the problem that there are backup forwards permanently in the starting lineup? Is the problem that the coaching has never been good?</p>

<p>Nope. The problem is the deadly three point shooting guard, who is reliable as all hell and has a great attitude. 👌</p>

<li><p>I am absolutely convinced Terry was a horrible coach.</p></li>

<li><p>Trading CJ for a wing wouldn&rsquo;t have helped, because there still would have been a CJ sized hole in the roster. Basically if you had traded him away for a wing, you&rsquo;d have then found you needed a super reliable shooting guard who can hit threes and create his own shot. Thinking trading CJ for a wing is akin to thinking a one-handed boxer just needed to trade away his left hand for a right hand.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your front office didn&rsquo;t keep CJ out of loyalty to Dame or CJ or the fan base. They didn&rsquo;t trade CJ because a difference making trade simply never materialized.</p>

<p>The ugly ass truth is, the player on your team who <strong>actually could</strong> have been traded for something meaningful was <strong>Dame</strong>, but he kinda boned you with that contract. If they had traded away Dame in say 2019, they could have gotten the draft capital and a few promising young players to turn it around. In an alternate universe where they traded Dame in somewhere circa 2017 to 2019, CJ is still the SG and Nurk is still the center, but there&rsquo;s a point guard who doesn&rsquo;t suck at defense and a reliable cast of wings and forwards, and the team is winning 50 to 55 games, basically being the Heat of the west: never the favorites, always a factor.</p>

<p>I said they should have traded Dame in about 2018.</p>

<p>They won 53 games that year.</p>

<p>After that they never won more than 42, and most years it was in the 20s and 30s.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, the 50 win seasons would be here right now if they had traded Dame then. Instead of the 19 wins, dreaming of Scooter and Sharpe becoming something crap they have now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nope. The problem is the deadly three point shooting guard, who is reliable as all hell and has a great attitude. 👌</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McCollum was so reliable that he posted a 53.0%TS in the playoffs over his career as a Blazer (and then 48.3% as a Pelican). Over his last four years as a Blazer he earned $107 million.</p>

<p>Over the same four years Dame earned $116 million. Meanwhile he posted a 56.1%TS as a Blazer… and then 64.0% as a Buck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you guys basically never got another decent PF, or wing for that matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that they tied up almost as much cap space in a secondary guard like McCollum who was basically a redundant, shittier version of Lillard.</p>

      <label for="llrcydz" class="commentText"><p>Not paying CJ what they paid him just prevented him from walking away for absolutely nothing. See VanVleet, Fred.</p>

<p>In general I agree that maxing CJ and Dame was a bad idea, I mainly just don&rsquo;t get why Dame always seems to escape any blame in that scenario.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t really get why you&rsquo;re looking at playoffs stats as if they matter much here. CJ was reliable as fuck in terms of helping in getting them to the playoffs. It&rsquo;s not his fault that in the playoffs, it&rsquo;s quite easy to play the &ldquo;we dare anyone not named CJ or Dame to get a bucket&rdquo; game. Dame and CJ Drew regular double teams in the playoffs, because everyone else on the team sucked.</p>

      <label for="llrvvh8" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with your premise that Dame wasn&rsquo;t as good (Offensively obviously) as people think and IDK what metrics you think suggests this.</p>

<p>Starting in 2019 all the way through 2023 he had the highest offensive DARKO in the league. He was top five in offensive RAPTOR in 2018-2021 (in 22’ he was 14th but I bet he would have been at the top in 23’ if they hadn&rsquo;t stopped calculating that season). From 2016-2021 he was top five in offensive LEBRON followed by ninth in 22 and the number one player in 23. Even OBPM is the same top five years (number one in 20’) with a one year hiatus in 22 and number two ranking in 23’.</p>

<p>I am somewhat inclined to agree if what you <em>meant</em> was that his defensive limitations make it hard for him to be your number one player but he absolutely <em>was</em> a franchise player with that elite level of offense. To your point, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever seen a championship team with their best player that bad at defense. Players like Steve Nash and Harden have been part of teams considered contenders with at least comparable levels of individual defense concerns but Harden’s size made it so he wasn&rsquo;t the same level of a liability and Nash played in an era where it wasn&rsquo;t exploited nearly as frequently as it is today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to second the notion that Stotts is being unfairly criticized here. I loved how he used Dame and CJ offensively. He may not be a great locker room presence (I have no idea if this is the perception), but he has a great basketball mind and did well with the personnel he was given. I was really upset when the Bucks lost him before the season started and knew that was going to be a problem for them even though I didn&rsquo;t see it becoming quite <em>that</em> bad.</p>

      <label for="llrzcz4" class="commentText"><p>Its really not that complicated. Dame was great and Stotts was really good. CJ was never really scapegoated but more was the clearly the only player with any value aside from Dame. They managed to be a mediocre team that outplayed their level and made the playoffs for like 6 straight years in a stacked Western conference where they&rsquo;d eventually get exposed as the team with significantly less talent. The only way CJ was a scapegoat was in the fact that the only thing teams had to do was key their entire defense around Dame and CJ was never enough to defeat that strategy alone. There was literally nobody else, just look at the rosters they had. It was constantly voiced they should trade him because it was their only realistic way to make a significant improvement to their roster.  If they had chance to get a good deal they should have traded him, they probably didn&rsquo;t, but they also didn&rsquo;t try enough to tool their roster around Dame.  FO was always the problem but Dame and Stotts managed to make them look good enough to keep the status quo.</p>

Also Dame’s production was always worse in the playoffs, one postseason he was locked up by Mike Conley and another by Jrue Holiday. Super debatable if he should’ve made the NBA 75 team. </p>

<p>Like a Dame, Marcus Smart, and say Paul George, Aaron Gordon, and Brooke Lopez starting 5 has a shot every year over the last 6-7 seasons but are they ever the favorites all else being equal??</p>

<p>Eastern playoffs was pretty much LeBron, Young Celtics, and Craptors. Even Philly wasn&rsquo;t really taken seriously until the 2019 playoffs.</p>

<p>I argued that CJ specifically should have joined a competitive East team especially when LeBron left. CJ and Dame were cooking and it wasn&rsquo;t just because they were good together, CJ could definitely cook on his own.</p>

<p>The reason I thought it would be a good idea is because it was obvious to anyone watching the games that the West was way better than the East and among the West teams, the Blazers were a top team, but not a favorite to win(because Golden state and Houston existed).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s obviously a really difficult decision to give up everything you were working on and leave your team but I felt like CJ and Dame were way too good to be just sitting in the West with such a low chance of winning.</p>

      <label for="lltjy7x" class="commentText"><p>As a die-hard Blazer fan, almost everyone believes CJ should have been traded. The issue was, Olshey was never able to find a 3rd player that had legit trade value on the team. Which I really think people forget about when evaluating the Dame era (POST Aldridge) is that the rest of the team were value bargain signings. There wasn&rsquo;t a draft pick or trade where we picked up on someone that had value to help us build the team up.</p>

<p>Stotts got the most out of guys like Harkless/Aminu/Plumlee/Nurkic/EdDavis etc but Olshey ended up overpaying for Harkless/Meyers/Crabbe extensions and killed any value they had once their rookie deals were up. The trade landscape was completely different after the KG/Pierce deals because no one was trading away multiple draft picks to get stars, you pretty much needed high draft picks like Buddy/Sabonis/Oladipo/Markannen/Dunn who were all top picks in order to get traded for stars like PG/Jimmy/Cousins.</p>

<p>But Portland kept creeping into the playoffs every year. The one guy that we developed into trade value was Gary Trent Jr that we traded for another small guy in Norm Powell who was great but wasn&rsquo;t a SF to pair next to Dame/CJ.</p>

<p>Essentially Portland wasn&rsquo;t confident in keeping the playoff streak without CJ because he helped out raise our floor and we were trying to build up on the margins and hoping to hit on a late draft pick like Nassir Little or Anfernee Simons (popped late) the one high pick we had was Zach Collins who kept getting hurt, if we drafted Bam instead of Zach then we really could have had something. The moments when we traded away draft capital we moved 2 1sts for Robert Covington and 1 for Larry Nance (the trade that took Lauri to Utah&hellip;)</p>

<p>So yes, they should have traded CJ and picks to get someone better than him. They just didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable moving CJ AND picks for someone because CJ was 75% of the other good stars but he wasn&rsquo;t a good enough fit.</p>

      <label for="llwpps7" class="commentText"><p>I think the sad truth is that Dame was never going to be a #1 and win a title.</p>

<p>He was always overrated, his defense always lacked, but no; the CJ pairing was not ideal. Yes, they needed a 2-way star to try and help balance Dames issues.</p>

<p>You nailed it - they were basically the Diet Splash Brothers, where the 2nd brother was not only <em>not</em> a defensive stalwart a la Klay, but yet another defensive liability. All on rosters not nearly as well chemically constructed as Golden State.</p>

<p>Dame&rsquo;s &lsquo;loyalty&rsquo; was ultimately an ego trip based on an unrealistic assumption that he could win as the #1 (in a small market no less).</p>

      <label for="llyght4" class="commentText"><p>Very obviously yes. I felt it was clear pretty well in advance that it wasn’t a serious contender. If the goal is a title, then they should have explored moving CJ much earlier.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I actually understand and sympathize with just wanting a good team, even if it isn’t necessarily a title contender. If you feel confident you’re going to win 45-50 games each season and maybe win a playoff round or two, I understand being hesitant to move off that for a mystery box.</p>

      <label for="lls9eea" class="commentText"><p>hmmm, so obviously that 2018-2019 season had a surprise WCF appearance for the Blazers. Clearly they would not blow things up then.</p>

<p>But then the 2019-2020 season happened and it really should have been and eye opener. Like yes Nurkic was coming back, but Dame had to super hard carry and the team was not that good. Then in the playoffs it was disappointment.</p>

<p>Then 2020-2021 happens and they really have the whole squad and there’s the frustration Dame showed at a first round exit. Imo that should have been the moment to blow it all up.</p>

<p>Instead they half blow it up. Imo the half blow up is a complete mistake. It should always be a full blow up. Washington had the same issue when they got rid of Wall and then kept Beal around too long.</p>

<p>Clearly going into 2021-2022 the FO knew they had to make changes, but the idea that you can rebuild around an aging undersized PG is never a good one. Dame obviously has a skillset that can keep him on the floor for a while, but the idea that the draft was going to give them the pieces when teams like Houston and OKC literally took 3-4 years with their perfect rebuilds says a lot. You’re not going to have Dame hang out until he is 34 to just start contending again, and the likelihood of having the rebuild done in 3-4 years is rare anyways when you look at Detroit that is still rebuilding after the Blake Griffin year.</p>

<p>So yes, they should have done it after the 2019-2020 season where Dame had to have an MVP year to carry them, but I think Portland viewed it as a business decision to keep their star around to sell tickets and jerseys and so they held him longer than they should.</p>

<p>Portland liked being a treadmill team. Being a treadmill team is bad for the fans and yet it’s great for the FOs because it means the team is relevant enough that they have to be paid attention to in case “this turns out to be it”. It means fans have to watch and attend games, especially in the regular season, which means more
money. It means higher ticket prices too. The FO was probably super happy with having a guy to sell their team even if they won nothing.</p>

      <label for="lls9gac" class="commentText"><p>Of course they should have.  Dame is a cancer to any team.  Portland did everything for him.  Constantly making moves to improve the team, paying him max money, always giving him the green light and he never took accountability for any of it.  He always let media/people say he has no help, while willingly taking all the glory for their wins.  He&rsquo;s just another James Harden/Luka.  These players are overly high usage no accountability stat mules that play little to no defense.</p>
