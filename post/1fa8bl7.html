</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Im a Blazers fan and I think the answer is yes and we should have done it a lot earlier. I always thought the Dame/CJ back court was fun to watch but we were never getting out of the West with the Splash Brothers.</p>

<p>The <sup>2016</sup>&frasl;<sub>2017</sub> season is an interesting one. The keys have well and truly been given to Dame post LA. CJ is coming off winning the most MIP and while Portland signed role players like Turner, Harkless and Crabbe to deals they still have some cap flexibility.</p>

<p>In hindsight would it not have been better to deal CJ back then and try to pair Dame with another star?</p>

<p>This was also a time a lot of players were moving around. With players like Boogie, Paul George and Jimmy Butler all being traded in 2017 should the Blazers have considered trading CJ?</p>

<p>Lillard (6&rsquo;2&rdquo;) and CJ (6&rsquo;3&rdquo;) had 52 wins and had that odd WCF run like you said.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s the smartest thing to be undersized, but it is possible to be good. Difference is, Bradley and Smart played defense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d bet if you put Bradley or Smart onto Lillard&rsquo;s team, they&rsquo;d have been better than with CJ. Still not elite, because the team wasn&rsquo;t amazing, but better.</p>

      <label for="llrcvey" class="commentText"><p>Yep. Unless you are a team with guaranteed income (Lakers, Bulls) or have an organization that has garnered enough public trust to go through a rebuild (Spurs), you&rsquo;re going to be losing a lot of money. Teardowns will only happen if the owner approves and/or the situation forces it (Nets). You&rsquo;re more likely to end on the Pistons&rsquo; side of a rebuild over an OKC result.</p>

<p>OKC did exact what &ldquo;kids on this sub&rdquo; and you are describing and gently benefitted from it. They trade all their star players for assets and are thriving.</p>

<p>They are also considered one of the best ran organizations in the league, while the team that never blows it up (bulls), is one of the worst ran organizations.</p>

<p>As it turns out, kids on 2k might know a thing or two.</p>

<p>Once he went down, the team seemed to fall apart.  Then Aldridge left in free agency and Olshey screwed up the rest of the roster.</p>

      <label for="llr96ev" class="commentText"><p>Just my opinion, the problem was never the fit between CJ and Dame. The problem was twofold.</p>

<p>One: Dame just isn&rsquo;t as good as people think. All his advanced metrics suggest he&rsquo;s in the correct role in the Bucks. Secondary scorer and lead ball handler, on a team with good defenders. Dame&rsquo;s belief that he was ever a franchise player, number one option type guy, and Portland fans seemingly universal belief that he is or was, and his supermax contract, are the reason it was impossible to win much.</p>

<p>Two: It does not help matters that after LMA left town, you guys basically never got another decent PF, or wing for that matter. Al Faruq Aminu, Grant&hellip; All the various bums the Blazers tried to get to play the three and the four&hellip; It&rsquo;s just been a dumpster fire. They never really had a starting caliber three or four.</p>

<p>The Blazers fans, and organization, did a super common thing among small market team fans and organizations: They blamed everything on the second best player. Is the problem that Dame isn&rsquo;t a good defender? Is the problem that there are backup forwards permanently in the starting lineup? Is the problem that the coaching has never been good?</p>

<p>Nope. The problem is the deadly three point shooting guard, who is reliable as all hell and has a great attitude. 👌</p>

We wanted that hypothetical wing, and we weren&rsquo;t going to get it without giving him up.</p>

<li><p>I am absolutely convinced Terry was a horrible coach.</p></li>

<li><p>Trading CJ for a wing wouldn&rsquo;t have helped, because there still would have been a CJ sized hole in the roster. Basically if you had traded him away for a wing, you&rsquo;d have then found you needed a super reliable shooting guard who can hit threes and create his own shot. Thinking trading CJ for a wing is akin to thinking a one-handed boxer just needed to trade away his left hand for a right hand.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your front office didn&rsquo;t keep CJ out of loyalty to Dame or CJ or the fan base. They didn&rsquo;t trade CJ because a difference making trade simply never materialized.</p>

<p>The ugly ass truth is, the player on your team who <strong>actually could</strong> have been traded for something meaningful was <strong>Dame</strong>, but he kinda boned you with that contract. If they had traded away Dame in say 2019, they could have gotten the draft capital and a few promising young players to turn it around. In an alternate universe where they traded Dame in somewhere circa 2017 to 2019, CJ is still the SG and Nurk is still the center, but there&rsquo;s a point guard who doesn&rsquo;t suck at defense and a reliable cast of wings and forwards, and the team is winning 50 to 55 games, basically being the Heat of the west: never the favorites, always a factor.</p>

<p>I said they should have traded Dame in about 2018.</p>

<p>They won 53 games that year.</p>

<p>After that they never won more than 42, and most years it was in the 20s and 30s.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, the 50 win seasons would be here right now if they had traded Dame then. Instead of the 19 wins, dreaming of Scooter and Sharpe becoming something crap they have now.</p>

<p>Stotts wasn&rsquo;t a horrible coach. That doesn&rsquo;t mean he was great either but he falls into that middle class of coaches that won&rsquo;t destroy things but won&rsquo;t make them markedly better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how he is as a leader or locker room presence but he was by no means a &ldquo;horrible coach&rdquo; and he did a phenomenal job if you ask me with the personnel he had that didn&rsquo;t complement Dame in ways they should have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nope. The problem is the deadly three point shooting guard, who is reliable as all hell and has a great attitude. 👌</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McCollum was so reliable that he posted a 53.0%TS in the playoffs over his career as a Blazer (and then 48.3% as a Pelican). Over his last four years as a Blazer he earned $107 million.</p>

<p>Over the same four years Dame earned $116 million. Meanwhile he posted a 56.1%TS as a Blazer… and then 64.0% as a Buck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you guys basically never got another decent PF, or wing for that matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that they tied up almost as much cap space in a secondary guard like McCollum who was basically a redundant, shittier version of Lillard.</p>

<p>In general I agree that maxing CJ and Dame was a bad idea, I mainly just don&rsquo;t get why Dame always seems to escape any blame in that scenario.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t really get why you&rsquo;re looking at playoffs stats as if they matter much here. CJ was reliable as fuck in terms of helping in getting them to the playoffs. It&rsquo;s not his fault that in the playoffs, it&rsquo;s quite easy to play the &ldquo;we dare anyone not named CJ or Dame to get a bucket&rdquo; game. Dame and CJ Drew regular double teams in the playoffs, because everyone else on the team sucked.</p>

Also Dame’s production was always worse in the playoffs, one postseason he was locked up by Mike Conley and another by Jrue Holiday. Super debatable if he should’ve made the NBA 75 team. </p>

      <label for="llr9mg0" class="commentText"><p>If this was a video game, then yeah they should have.</p>

<p>But in the real world? Firstly, I think they were hoping LMA would hang around, and their biggest mistake might have actually not trying to trade him with a year left.</p>

<p>But once LMA was gone and it was clear Dame was their franchise player? You then don&rsquo;t trade a player like Dame until he asks out. And you don&rsquo;t trade his teammate like CJ until Dame is ok with it.</p>

<p>In some organisations/markets/FO&rsquo;s you can get away with that because you can sell to Dame that he just needs to trust the organisation knows what they are doing, and you can also then manage it if he pushes out, but I&rsquo;m not sure if Portland was in that kind of position.</p>

      <label for="llrckik" class="commentText"><p>Portland was in a position where they could put out a competitive team, make it to the playoffs every year if Dame/CJ/Nurk were healthy and get 2-8 additional home games every season on top of the fan fair of being a competitive team. I don&rsquo;t think trading away CJ could have made the team title contenders,, they would have had to go into rebuild mode unless they did some trade in 2017 for PG or something. From an ownership perspective, keeping CJ was probably the correct move. They made the playoffs every year with him as their 2nd option. It&rsquo;s not always championship or bust, sometimes putting together a competitive team that your fans can enjoy is still a win and good for business.</p>

When similar teams around that time like OKC and Minnesota were able to get PG and Jimmy respectively what was his excuse? Four starters leaving in 2015, the god awful 2016 free agency, the trash 2017 draft picks and the 2018 playoffs forever cemented Dame would never win a ring in Portland</p>
