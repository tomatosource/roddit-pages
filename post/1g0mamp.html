</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In a series of unpublished interviews with ESPN, West described reaching a crossroads in life and in work.</p>

<p>He had been deeply wounded, he said, by events the previous summer and continuing into that fall &ndash; ones that fully and finally severed any remaining ties to the Lakers, the franchise he spent 40 years helping to build.</p>

<p>During that tenure, first as a player, then a coach, then an executive, West had helped lift the organization to historic heights before this coldest of wars. In the years since, he had hoped for reconciliation. Then, in 2019, after his family became involved, one of the most famous Lakers in history shared a once-unthinkable sentiment, one that he&rsquo;d repeat privately and publicly in the years ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost wish,&rdquo; West told ESPN, &ldquo;that I had never played or worked for them.&rdquo;</p>

It was literally just a recognition of a person&rsquo;s achievements and impact on the game, handed out directly by the league, with no pressure by any players. Perfect for someone like Babe Ruth, or, you know, <em>Jerry West</em>.</p>

      <label for="lrbjnlz" class="commentText"><p>Baseball has a very long history of players doing the right thing and barriers being broken. Jackie Robinson is the obvious case that everyone knows, but Curt Flood did nearly as much for ALL athletes in EVERY sport in his own contest to labor rights.</p>

<p>There are a lot of external factors that have helped, like the AL and NL having been separate but competing entities for a long time, the MLB being granted an anti-trust exemption, the leagues having an extremely robust farm system and NCAA rules helping eligibility more than other sports, etc. But the players have never been afraid to strike and stand up for things they believe they deserve to have. The International reach probably helps a lot too. Baseball is far more diverse in terms of birth countries than the other major North American sports.</p>

      <label for="lrdlk10" class="commentText"><p>The players got next to nothing.</p>

<p>In the wake of the Great Recession some smaller market teams were actually losing money so the league was threatening to let those teams fold if they had to and have those roster spots disappear unless the salary structure was changed. The players offered to reduce their share to 53% but the owners dug in. They had been preparing for the confrontation.</p>

<p>This led to the lockout of 2011 where the players blinked first like they almost always do because it&rsquo;s harder for them to miss paychecks than it is for corporations to weather predictable reductions in revenue. The players gained the &ldquo;Derrick Rose Rule&rdquo; and got any shortfalls in the escrow accounts to be paid out of retirement benefits instead of from salaries the subsequent season.</p>

<p>The owners allowed themselves to be bargained out of a hard cap but got everything else they wanted: an equal share of the revenue, maximum contract lengths shortened by one year, increases in the luxury tax and consequences for being over the tax line, and an increase in the escrow amounts from 8% to 10% to make shortfalls much less likely.</p>

The NBA and the NFL players associations are just popularity contests and the people in charge don&rsquo;t really have any stake in helping the people at the bottom. You need educated individuals who really care to run your players associations and honestly most the time it&rsquo;s not worth putting up with the headache of all the other people bitching so they just don&rsquo;t do it</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think his beef was with Phil, but with Jeanie and the Rambis family. The article mentions that he hired Phil over Kurt Rambis back in late 90s which led to our next 5 rings lol.</p>

<p>He left the Lakers in 2000 so he missed out on two additional rings after being a huge part in getting Kobe/Phil and left the Warriors in 2017, also missing out on 2 rings after securing Durant. Truly should have 4 more rings on his resume than he already does which is nuts.</p>

<p>“It didn’t feel very good when someone would walk right by me and not even acknowledge you’re there. But that’s Phil,” wrote West in his autobiography, “West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life. “Frankly you start to feel under-appreciated and undervalued. It was time for me to go, but it was best for the Lakers and best for me.”</p>

      <label for="lrblvrp" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. The way they treated West is an indictment on them, but it should surprise no-one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s part of a long-term pattern of inept leadership. If the Lakers were run properly they&rsquo;d have more titles than Boston for sure (maybe even if you took away the Minneapolis ones they abruptly decided to claim in the early 2000s in one of the more cynical pieces of PR garbage in NBA history).</p>

<p>Major market, league darling franchise, friendly whistles, great weather, celebrities sitting courtside, they&rsquo;re the #1 free agency destination in the NBA and it isn&rsquo;t close.</p>

<p>That they can&rsquo;t convert all that into utter domination is hilarious.</p>

<p>Also, he was in the Clippers front office and did pro scouting for them so Lakers were essentially paying him to work for a local rival and opposing team. The same team that just signed a star free agent they were both going for and then published billboards across the city insulting them.</p>

<p>He probably still deserved to keep them in spite of all that but at that point he was working very directly against the Lakers and their interests and using the season tickets to do so. I don&rsquo;t know how many other teams or organizations of any kind would continue to extend such a benefit to a former employee.</p>

      <label for="lravsag" class="commentText"><p>I was trying to make the situation more generalizable but you&rsquo;re right, the situation isn&rsquo;t a general one. West is the greatest Laker ever when you consider his playing and front office career, on top of being the NBA logo. He was even willing to bury the hatchet and come back in 2017 when the Lakers restructured but was rebuffed. So the Lakers could have avoided all this and been in a better situation. They deserve the flak they get for having that relationship go as south as it did.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that once the divorce was finalized and West had dedicated himself to working against the Lakers, the decision to not give him more resources to do so is pretty justifiable on a professional basis.</p>

      <label for="lrbl6t8" class="commentText"><blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that once the divorce was finalized and West had dedicated himself to working against the Lakers, the decision to not give him more resources to do so is pretty justifiable on a professional basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that how it works though? I figured that since they shared the arena, the Clips and Lakers both had office space there for management/FO personnel. I figured that Jerry could go through the employee entrance for free whenever he wanted regardless of if the Lakers were playing or not.</p>

<p>Based on that assumption, I figured taking the tickets was more of a &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; because it meant he couldn&rsquo;t bring <em>other people</em> (friends/family) in with him to watch games.</p>

<p>Again though, that was just my assumption. It could 100% be totally wrong.</p>

      <label for="lrca01j" class="commentText"><p>I’m with you here. Jerry West and every other executive in the NBA attend games regularly, even away games. I don’t have the 100% answer on how that works, but I’m willing to say it’s crazy to suggest West was actually benefitting against the Lakers through these tickets or even that the Lakers actually believed this.  </p>

<p> The Clippers infamously attended Kawhi’s games when he was on the Raptors. It was known that they were attending. Lawrence Frank isn’t a Raptors legend so that’s not why. I assume NBA executives can go to games basically. </p>

      <label for="lrb0vt7" class="commentText"><p>I think most teams would try to keep a good relationship with arguably their greatest and most influential member (especially if you combine West&rsquo;s career as a player and builder).</p>

<p>If the Bulls gave Michael Jordan a middle finger like this because he was Charlotte&rsquo;s owner (even in an imaginary scenario where Charlotte and the Bulls were rivals), I&rsquo;d say that was wrong too.</p>

<p>If you get lifetime tickets for being the arguable GOAT of the team, then they should only be rescinded if you do something really terrible like murder.</p>

      <label for="lrb63ip" class="commentText"><p>The idea Jerry West used his second tickets against the Lakers in any meaningful sense is only team propaganda from where im standing. His having season tickets didn’t matter except emotionally. The cost is nothing to them, the benefits to Jerry’s job are nothing (as I would say for anyone in that position). </p>

<p>Please, if I’m wrong, do explain. Staff members don’t need season tickets to help their scouting. It reads like nonsense without more detail at least. </p>

      <label for="lrbg3bt" class="commentText"><p>Honestly once you play a certain number of games in the league you should basically get guaranteed lifetime tickets to any NBA game you want to go to. Maybe exclude championship games and some of the playoff stuff but there&rsquo;s no reason why teams or the league itself shouldn&rsquo;t just let some of these guys in to watch a game, making them pay is not only asinine but maybe the worst possible PR decision you could make</p>

<p>Jeanie&rsquo;s father Jerry Buss grew up poor as hell. His father abandoned his family and he worked all kinds of low end jobs to fund his way through college. He made his millions on his own.</p>

<p>Mark Cuban was also from a working class family. His father was a car upholsterer. He made his money when he and a friend created and then later sold <a href="http://Broadcast.com" target="_blank">Broadcast.com</a> to Yahoo.</p>

<p>Tillman Fertitta&rsquo;s father had a small restaurant and he grew up peeling shrimp for his dad after school. He made his money via hospitality businesses.</p>

<p>Peter Holt&rsquo;s dad worked for his brother&rsquo;s Caterpillar dealership. He joined the army and when he was done w/that he went back to his uncle and father and through his business acumen now runs pretty much all of the Caterpillar dealerships in Texas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty more who built their own business empires. They aren&rsquo;t all just kids of billionaires.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard and read stories from Lakers fans meeting with West and he seemed to be a super cool guy, really loved the team and the fans but the ownership was the real problem.</p>

<p>Even as a Celtics fan I find it sad that 3 people alone ruined one person&rsquo;s perspective towards a franchise like the Lakers that represents millions.</p>

Their brand popularity may not last forever but it isn’t just tied to LeBron and it’ll continue well past him.<br>
The Lakers and Celtics literally prevented the NBA from going bankrupt. They are integral to the league. The showtime lakers, Kobe lakers, and now Lebron lakers have built fans around the world. As well as completely owning Southern California. (sorry to the 15 clipper fans)</p>

He&rsquo;s responsible for Phil and Kobe joining the team and was instrumental for 5 decades. Laker fans in general, the non-lebron ones, never disrespect any of our old legends. It&rsquo;s literally the team&rsquo;s legacy.</p>

      <label for="lraaelw" class="commentText"><p>Sorry to rain on your hate parade but almost any real Lakers fans knows this crap is wrong. Jeanie hasn’t done herself any favors recently. The goodwill she had after breaking away from her brother is almost entirely gone. LeBron turned the trash Lakers into the #1 seed and champions in 2020, watched her preferred GM eventually blow that team up for Russ, somehow get enough back for that disaster to make the WCF, only to be swept and then go back to being a play-in team while not actually improving any part of the roster or fixing the holes from the championship team. Jeanie is out of her league and has surrounded herself with longtime friends like the Rambii and Pelinka. It’s going to be a fucking disaster once LeBron and then AD are gone.</p>

I hate the Lakers but I’m not ignorant to the fact that they will always be relevant to some degree regardless if their current team is competing for a championship or not. 17 championships, numerous all time greats, massive media market, attractive free agent destination and billionaires ready to sign checks. It’s like the Yankees. Yeah they haven’t won for awhile, but everyone knows they inevitably will win again sometime because they don’t need to build a team from the ground up through years of development.</p>

<p>When Bron leaves that team will recover. Some group of dudes will meet up there. Or some successful GM will get hired on and rebuild them.</p>

The lakers will once again be the most talked about play-in team and get bounced by the top seed with a legitimate young core. I’m not a hater, but they’re old and haven’t been championship ready in several years.</p>

<p>That is a really indicative statement, goddamn. Really petty by the Lakers to pull the tickets from him, considering how insanely monumental he was for the team&rsquo;s success.</p>

Magic was a horrible president, but he even says he felt backstabbed by Pelinka/Lakers. Jerry is probably the most impactful member of the Lakers organization, yet they took his season tickets away, Jeanie didn&rsquo;t even list him as one of the most influential members of the Lakers org.</p>

<p>Everyone likes to talk about the Kobe  contract but it was just good timing considering the Lakers were in a rebuild phase.</p>

I think without him being involved they never win 5 championships 2000-2010. The way they treated a former player and gm was just so unprofessional. Jerry Buss seemed to be a good owner but man do the Lakers have a shit front office the past 11 years. I don&rsquo;t think the Lakers will recover from this reputation easily we might not see a lakers championship for decades.</p>
