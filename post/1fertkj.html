      <label for="lmsbs5w" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a particularly weird case, at least not for the top 10 discussion. Lots of players don&rsquo;t fully live up to their talent - KD came closer to doing so than probably 99% of players. He&rsquo;s just a very good player that isn&rsquo;t top 10 level. I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;the way he won&rdquo; is much of a factor here. A ring without Curry probably doesn&rsquo;t move him into the top 10 unless it was a truly legendary carry job.</p>

<p>It would be different if he had a top 10 season of all time but struggled to repeat it or something, but as it is pretty much everything about him puts him in the 11-25 range.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of weirdness in how you rate his rings (genuinely amazing Finals performances, but on that superteam) once you start comparing him to the next tier of players. But at that point much of the competition has other notable asterisks to their legacies so he fits in.</p>

      <label for="lmtppej" class="commentText"><p>I deliberately picked a wide range because I said “pretty much everything about him”, but I think it’s quite easy to leave him out of the top 15. You have 12 players that are hard to put him ahead of - I don’t think it’s hard to argue for three more. Oscar, Dr J, Moses, Giannis, Jokic, Dirk, Karl Malone, Jerry West, KG - people will rank those nine guys + KD differently but I think putting him fourth there is fine.</p>

<p>And could argue about what counts as a “shot” but I would say that what we need to see to put him into the top 10 would be almost unprecedented for a 36-year-old.</p>

<p>Chris Paul is way older than Robertson was when he joined Kareem in Milwaukee and the Bucks had more surrounding talent, but it&rsquo;s kind of a cool parallel with CP3 joining Wemby in San Antonio</p>

      <label for="lmscfrf" class="commentText"><p>Eh, doesn’t really play the same. Teams having ups and downs is common and you could apply that to just about any situation where the best player doesn’t win the title.</p>

<p>It’s pretty unique to have a guy who is obviously the best in the game retire in between 3 straight titles.</p>

<p>Although, as a Lebron guy, I’m totally cool with the “Jordan had circumstances break his way” thing.</p>

      <label for="lmsh71u" class="commentText"><p>it’s not that jordan got lucky, that’s not the point at all. the point is twofold: first, that every chip involves boatloads of luck, of things falling your way. jordan (and bron for that matter) are no exceptions to this point.</p>

<p>second, hakeem won not having to face jordan, but jordan also won not having to face hakeem. hakeem was a match up nightmare on both sides of the ball for the bulls, it doesn’t actually make sense to say that he lucked out not having to play jordan, because there’s no real guarantee jordan’s bulls would’ve beaten his rockets. we don’t know for sure, though.</p>

<p>what we do know is that hakeem won his two chips playing and beating all the same teams - the best of the 90s - that jordan did to win his 6. blazers, jazz, suns, knicks, and shaq’s magic (same team that beat jordan b t w)(also as an aside he beat the 86 kareem and magic lakers, better squad than the 90 lakers jordan beat). they also beat the mvp robinson spurs, which jordan never had the pleasure of in a playoff setting. 4 50 win teams in a single playoff run as the 6th seed.</p>

<p>it cannot be overstated how insane these two runs were. i value them more than any individual 3peat (but not jordan’s two). hakeem peaked at a GOAT level, and that’s why i speak about him as jordan’s contemporary, not lesser. only superstar of the 90s that gets that respect, because he earned it.</p>

<p>The only others worth considering are Malone, Giannis, Dirk, and KG. None of those players have more than one ring. Neither of those has a winning record against TD. TD has higher PPG and RPG in h2h MUs with those players. TD has more 1st team all NBA&rsquo;s than Dirk and KG combined. Has more FMVPs than all of those guys combined.</p>

<p>If you wanted to say you&rsquo;d take 2011 Dirk or 2021 Giannis over any single year of Duncan then sure. I could absolutely see that being valid. But taking any other PFs entire career over Duncan&rsquo;s would be nonsensical.</p>

<p>Nobody ever questioned who was better between Shaq and Duncan when they were both active and most people thought Kobe was better aswell. This narrative that Tim Duncan was carrying some bums to titles is absolutely wild, he never played on a bad team in his entire career.</p>

<p>Having Tim Duncan in the Top 10 as 9th or 10th is fine, just like having him at 11th or 12th also is, but folks on r/nba think they are smart when they put him way higher when he just doesn&rsquo;t deserve it. Him and Bill Russell are BY FAR the worst offensive players in that Top 12 range, the difference is that Russell played in the 1960s.</p>

      <label for="lmrorey" class="commentText"><p>Of all the MVP level guys I watched growing up Duncan probably has the biggest discrepancy between fan perception at the time and fan perception in hindsight. In the mid 2000s I would never have expected to see people asking why Tim Duncan isn&rsquo;t in the GOAT conversation.</p>

      <label for="lmt068j" class="commentText"><p>His offensive dominance was just not the same as guys in that conversation. 
He had moments where he could be a dominant scorer but he wasn’t by default. And it’s not like he was the lead playmaker if he wasn’t dominating the scoring (i.e. Bird or Magic or Jokic). </p>

<p>He has some of the best playoff performances ever but I think back then it was easy to see he could just fall back on Parker and Ginobili as needed and they at times felt like the offensive superstar even if Duncan was always capable of dropping <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub>. </p>

<p>On the flip side, he rarely ever came up short if a big performance was needed. He’s kind of like Jokic in that sense, not gonna average 30 ppg ever but will do it almost every time its required. But his defense was all time so it’s really tough to argue against him as defense was more important than ever in that sorry ass offensive era</p>

He honestly could&rsquo;ve been GOAT if he cared about maximizing his fitness &amp; longevity as well improving his ft shooting even marginally. But since he cared more about being a celebrity and burned bridges with every team he played for, I think it bumps him down closer 8-10.</p>

If you value peak or the ability to dominate a single game or even season, then he&rsquo;s near the top. But in the pantheon of great centers when accounting for legacy I think he&rsquo;s realistically only the 4th or 5th &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; center.</p>

<p>There are only 5 players who I think are being argued to be the GOAT, or was GOAT by most reasonable analysts.  Those are:</p>

<p><strong>MJ, Lebron, Kareem, Russell, and Wilt</strong></p>

<p>And yes, they have different cases.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>The other half of top 10-12 list like</p>

<p><strong>Magic, Larry, Timmy, Shaq, Kobe, Hakeem, Steph</strong></p>

<p>They are considered all time greats. But they were never considered a GOAT candidate in any point of their careers.</p>

<p>I think part of it was that when he retired, a lot of people still had clear memories of Russell and Wilt. Plus his popularity was completely overshadowed by Bird and Magic, followed by MJ</p>

<p>As the memories of all of those players fade, his stats are really elevating his case</p>

<p>But yeah, I&rsquo;d say that when he retired, there were more people calling Oscar the GoAT than Kareem</p>

<p>Magic and Bird were considered GOAT candidates during their active time in the league. Back in the 80s/90s, Kareem didn&rsquo;t have receive half of the respect he receives today in GOAT talks and most people saw Magic as the engine that made Showtime work. Kobe also inarguably got GOAT talk after he won his 5th ring, so much so that you have video evidence on YouTube of sports shows saying that he was getting close to Jordan and comparing the two.</p>

<p>GOAT talk evolved alot as time went on and the criteria consistently changed as years went by. It went from Wilt/Russell/Robertson to Magic/Bird/Wilt/Russell to Jordan being basically undisputed with a few nonsense Kobe and LeBron arguments popping up. Kareem is the only odd one that got more and more attention and somehow got better 30 years after he retired.</p>

<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s how we always saw him?  Maybe not stated so harshly, but I remember that his entire career he was being talked about as, &ldquo;almost as good as Jordan, but never quite there,&rdquo; and never got more than that unless some media personality was trying to drive discussion.  And obviously, he never made it over the hump</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the bad luck of having such similar skillsets.  Bron can be in a discussion vs. Jordan because there are certain things he can do that Jordan couldn&rsquo;t.  Obviously he&rsquo;s a better rebounder, can guard centers better, is a better distributor than we saw Jordan being for most of his career (yes yes there was that time in the &lsquo;88-89 season where he played PG, but you know what I mean), and then obviously all the longevity stats.  And of course there are things Jordan did that Bron can&rsquo;t.  Therefore, there&rsquo;s a debate there</p>

<p>Whereas I don&rsquo;t think there was <em>ever</em> time where Kobe was considered better than Jordan at <em>anything</em></p>

Kobe&rsquo;s entire run in the Finals is basically Jordan&rsquo;s worst Finals guarded by amazing teams. It&rsquo;s just not something you can hack together when you look at the stats.</p>

<p>Kobe nephews always bring up efficiency without bringing up his free throws. Where as Jordan was a lot more pure in the 2P% 5% purer just based on that pretty much. That&rsquo;s just too much for similar players, and some of the bigger guys are obviously higher.</p>

<p>Not all of the greatest players had the best careers. 
Dr. J spent part of career in a different league. Sabonis was stuck over in Europe. </p>

<p>But the list of the greatest careers of all time is made up solely of the greatest players.
There’s no Robert Horrys on the list. 
It’s Jordan, Lebron, Kareem, Russell. </p>

<p>He never signed the franchise contract, and bounced around the league on several different teams. </p>

      <label for="lmpvigs" class="commentText"><p>imo if you include shaq and wilt over hakeem and duncan you just like flash over substance, aesthetic over actual winning basketball.</p>

<p>hakeem’s back to back runs are both individually and together all timers, he won both without a true star next to him (half a season of old drexler does not count as a star), and he peaked at as high a level as anyone during those two years, hence him being the only dude ever to win MVP/DPOY/FMVP in the same year. the more u look at those runs and the teams he faced and the responsibility he had on his shoulders and the more you realize that the rockets could’ve been the western rivals the bulls never truly had, had sampson’s body not exploded (and also their backcourt exited the league for certain cola reasons).</p>

<p>duncan won 5, more than either of them, and he won his directly facing shaq to get some of them in the same conference same era. better defender than both, better team player than both, better winner than both.</p>

<p>insulting to leave him off ur top 10 list, he’s earned his place alongside kobe, just as steph has alongside lebron, and larry next to magic, as hakeem did holding down the fort while mj took some time off. wilt did jack shit to earn his place next to bill besides put up gaudy self serving stats. shaq needed kobe and phil for his 3 then rode wade and pat’s bus to a 4th. these two players are 1 of 1 talents each, but their mentals held them back from true greatness. we should be talking abt both as goat candidates, that’s the standard they held themselves to, and they both fell way short of it due entirely to their own failures. solid top 14 of all time players</p>

      <label for="lmsb28c" class="commentText"><p>I think the reason we&rsquo;re seeing people discredit Shaq these days, especially places on reddit, is that it&rsquo;s easy to dismiss his game as &ldquo;boring&rdquo;.  He basically just caught the ball in the low post and then it was either a dunk or a baby hook.  So it&rsquo;s easy to dismiss him as &ldquo;limited&rdquo; or whatever</p>

<p>Whereas Hakeem&rsquo;s rise in places like r/nba is because his game was so varied, he had so many tricks in his bag, it&rsquo;s so easy to call him &ldquo;skilled&rdquo; and pump that up.  His game was easy to love, because yeah, it was gorgeous and awesome</p>

<p>Dismissing Shaq, and pumping up Hakeem (and Duncan) is attractive because it plays into what people <em>want</em> to be true.  We <em>want</em> skill and finesse and variety to be more important than just raw power</p>

<p>But the fact is that two points are two points.  And just because Shaq scored most of his points the same way doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that he scored a <em>lot</em> of them, and his teams won a <em>lot</em> of games because of it.  He basically only had one or two moves because nobody was able to stop them</p>

      <label for="lmtvje8" class="commentText"><p>I have an answer but here’s how I’m gonna get my point across: even if Curry was the best player in the league that year, He has the same amount of years being the player in the league (2015-16, 2021-2022) that Hakeem had and clearly he wasn’t the best player that second mvp year. That was Lebron still even if Steph had the better year.</p>

<p>To answer your question: Giannis.</p>

Duncan won all 5 in San Antonio and was the foundation for arguably the most successful and well run franchise in pro sports over the last 25 years. I’d put him second only to Tom Brady as a franchise cornerstone.</p>

      <label for="lmryced" class="commentText"><p>Without looking at bball reference, name all memorable things about Duncan, 2003 run is all people ever go to and it’s become overrated and after there’s nothing, u gotta have a few seasons where u just dominated like other greats but he doesn’t have any seasons, he fails the eye test. For a big he was inefficient, wasn’t a great ft shooter and had terrible fg% in lots of playoff series. Not to mention choking away series too, losing as a 1 seed to a 8 seed. Never repeated as a champion, never had to carry garbage teams and bums like other greats. He had a great coach and teammates his whole career.
Never held to the standard of other greats, he could average 14ppg and not be an all star and the team still win and make playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lmszvrt" class="commentText"><p>I never loved the coach and teammates argument. Agreed with everything else you said but great players raise the bar for their team and coaches. Curry is there while getting 2 of those rings with KD. Kobe is there where he had Phil and Shaq for 3 rings. You can go down that whole list and do that. Bird, Magic, Lebron, and etc. Agreed on everything else though.</p>

      <label for="lmumbzv" class="commentText"><p>Kobe does not fit with these people. His shooting outside free throws just doesn&rsquo;t compete with literally any of them but Russell, who played in an entirely different era and was not very offensively gifted. His Finals performances don&rsquo;t compete either.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m unsure how people who watched these games and know advanced stats can still pick Kobe top 10. It makes no sense. He peaked at 46% from the field. Was noticeably not great in Finals games going about 41% from the field even worse in the 4th quarter.</p>

<p>Without Shaq and the legendary whistle, he&rsquo;s not even top 20.</p>
