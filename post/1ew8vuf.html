</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The 96 Bulls famously went 72-10. One interesting fact about that team that doesn&rsquo;t really get talked about is that their last three losses were each by one single point.</p>

<ul>
<li>On March 26, 1996, the Bulls lost on the road to Toronto, 109 to 108. With the Bulls down one, on the final possession and what appeared to be a broken play, Jordan was disrupted by Alvin Robertson and gave the ball up to Kerr. Kerr swung it to Pippen at the top of the key and Pippen swung the ball back to Kerr for a reasonably open three point shot. He missed and the game ended 109 to 108. After that loss, the Bulls fell to 60-8 for the season.</li>
<li>On April 8, 1996, the Bulls lost at home to Charlotte, 98 to 97. With the Bulls down one in their final possession, Toni Kukoc surprisingly was the primary ball handler and with 8.5 seconds, drove to the hoop for a layup. While missing the layup, the Bulls were able to get three offensive rebounds and put back attempts at close range (Rodman, Jordan, and Pippen). They all missed and the game ended with a 98 to 97 Charlotte victory. This snapped the Bulls 44 game home win streak. The Bulls record fell to 66-9.</li>
<li>On April 20, 1996, the Bulls lost to the Pacers again at home, 100 to 99. With 50.3 seconds left in the game, Jordan tied the game 99-99 with a 17 foot baseline jumper. Eddie Johnson then forced and missed a long 2 with 26 seconds left. Jordan then had a chance to take the lead, but missed a 16 foot jumper with 8 seconds left. Eddie Johnson again forced another long two with just .2 seconds left, but Jordan was called for a shooting foul on Johnson (after watching the replay, its very surprising a foul was called given the minimal contact, the fact that it was a Chicago home game, and the fact that it was Jordan being assessed a foul). Johnson hit one of two free throws and the Bulls lost the game. At this point, the Bulls already had 71 wins and their record fell to 71-10 for the year. Their home record fell to 39-2, falling short of the 1986 Celtics&rsquo; 40-1 home record.</li>
</ul>

<p>As one-point games can go either way, it was quite possible we could be talking about a 75-7 Bulls team. And I know people are going to ask this, but no, they did not have any one point victories. Their smallest margin of victory was two points, which happened once (Dec. 30 1995 against the Hawks). They also played in two OT games, which they ended up winning by six and three points. They had four wins where they won by 3 points</p>
