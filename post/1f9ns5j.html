      <p>I am not talking about who will win Rookie of the Year. Since it is highly dependent on opportunities and playtime you will get.</p>

<p>But based on what you saw on draft work outs , or in their pre nba leagues, and in summer league.</p>

<p>Who do you feel is the best player in the draft?</p>

<p>Is it Edey? Sheppard? Sarr? Risacer? Etc?</p>

      <label for="llnoj1o" class="commentText"><p>I believe he played what 26 mpg for warriors last season but he explicitly said he signed with spurs with playing time being one of the factors, which makes me think Pop will try to load manage him essentially like they did with Wemby last year around 29-31 mins per night. Meaning 18+mpg at backup PG and I can see Castle getting all of backup SG mins (probably about 15+mpg) so if they play him like a combo guard going between backup SG and PG, depending on Tre Jones, I can see Castle getting 18-25 mins a night, probably more later in the season</p>

Maybe he ends up just being a serviceable starting Pg but his pace is sp deliberate and rock solid, if he can just get near league average from 3, combined with his driving + defense I think he could be really good as a pg in the nba. Few better than CP3, Popovich to mentor him to be the best variation of Dejounte Murray, Derrick White type spur. A little advice from Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen, Ginobili and Duncan every now and then won’t hurt eienter</p>

<ul>
<li>Memphis needs a starting center. Edey will pop in that spot.</li>
<li>With GG down for a few months, Edey will see an increased playing time. He will get to adapt at a faster rate.</li>
<li>JJJ is a stretch <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>, so teams will be defending his 3-Point shot, leaving Edey to either eat the rebound or easy buckets.</li>
<li>He will be in a ton of pick and rolls with Ja. If he can get a consistent midrange, it&rsquo;ll be very similar to Conley/Gasol pick and pop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Edey will eat this year, and he will eat well. As long as he stays healthy, he&rsquo;s almost guaranteed Rookie 1st Team.</p>

      <label for="llmywxw" class="commentText"><p>Sheppard and Castle. And it won’t be particularly close. I go with Sheppard for his far superior offensive talent compared to every other rookie, but Castle will be the real deal as an above average two way guard from day one.</p>

<p>On Sheppard, people don’t realize it’s not just that he is one of the best shooters to come out of college in modern history (99th percentile in every shooting metric  — contested threes, threes off dribble, spotting up, contested twos, etc — he’s also a highly skilled facilitator who will immediately be a strong pick and roll player while making the right play almost always when the ball is swung to him. And he has incredibly high steal+block rates for any guard. His mind on the court is elite and he plays bigger than he is on both ends because of it.</p>

      <label for="llnbxpn" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m going to pump the brakes on Sheppard. He didn&rsquo;t even start in college, and had a pretty good showing in Summer League which is historically favorable to ball-dominant guards. He looks like a great young player, but I need to see how he plays in real minutes against professionals before annointing him.</p>

<p>With Castle, I think he might get exposed in the NBA if he can&rsquo;t learn how to shoot, which is easier said than done. For every Kawhi there are 10 other guys we don&rsquo;t even recall their names because they couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

      <label for="lln0u9h" class="commentText"><p>Probably Edey and Knecht. Most rookie classes where there aren’t obvious generational talents, the best players in year 1 are the older college or international guys. Like Jaquez and Podz would have been last year if not for Wemby/Chet.</p>

      <label for="lln4wbt" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m worried Edey&rsquo;s ceiling is much much lower than his draft position. There is so much interior defensive talent from guys that are significantly more athletic than him that he might struggle to score most games.</p>

      <label for="llnajg1" class="commentText"><p>My answer&rsquo;s Zachry Edey. While I don&rsquo;t think he offers the most long-term potential in the class, I think his college strengths will transfer pretty immediately - being huge will provide rim protection and screen-setting value. Walker Kessler comes to mind as a similar player who made an immediate impact as a rook. Sheppard or Castle might be better long term, but the learning curve is so steep for a rookie guard (see Henderson, Scoot).</p>

      <label for="llnn792" class="commentText"><p>I tend to agree that Edey will look great in year 1, and will probably reach his ceiling pretty quickly, however you want to interpret that. If Ja is back in form this year I think Edey will feast.</p>

      <label for="llnb1ph" class="commentText"><p>Risacher and Edey will contribute to winning basketball, while Sheppard and Castle will put up great stats on bad teams.

      <label for="llnjfej" class="commentText"><p>Disagree. The Hawks and Grizzlies will each win more games than every other team that selected in the lottery except the Thunder. I expect both teams in the ~45 wins range. Risacher can immediately plug in as a volume movement shooter and long wing defender, probably off the bench to start the year with ~20 minutes per game.</p>

<p>ALL of these rookies need a lot of development on a LOT of things. Risacher acknowledged the biggest area he can improve is ball-handling, and I tend to agree. He is a good and willing passer making quick decisions with the ball, and he can finish in traffic, but obviously as a rookie he will need to work on every part of his game, just like everyone else.</p>

      <label for="llnoml0" class="commentText"><p>Ah ok I think I misread your comment on if they swapped teams - I’m generally higher on Reed as someone who plays “winning style” ball due to his BBIQ regardless of his teams record, unlike Risacher who I think is a lot more green and will end up looking lost on offense (when not spotting up) or at times on defense (despite his physical tools).</p>

      <label for="llns5to" class="commentText"><p>Gotcha.. yea I do think Reed has a ton of potential, I&rsquo;m just not sold that he&rsquo;s going to be Prime Steph Curry in year 1. I think Risacher has a lot more valuable experience than Sheppard as one of the best young players in actual professional leagues playing against grown men. LNB and Eurocup are far more advanced than NCAA college basketball, and it bothers me that Sheppard didn&rsquo;t start for his team in college, even though I do see there are some legitimate reasons for that based on coaching decisions. Risacher&rsquo;s individual performance led to winning basketball at a high level, so I don&rsquo;t understand why you or anyone would view him as being very green. He took his team to the playoffs and performed well against top level teams.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, in the NBA they will both look lost on defense at times. But they will also both show flashes. I would like to see Reed show the ability to pressure the point of attack, and I&rsquo;d like to see Risacher playing free safety style perimeter defense; he has the potential to be VERY disruptive on the wing if the Hawks use him as a <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> as they&rsquo;ve said they plan to. A switchable 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; SG with quick feet could be a nightmare for smaller guards and wings to make plays against.</p>

<p>Hopefully they both look great this year! I do think Reed will be a lot of fun to watch, and he should get plenty of opportunities to shine!</p>

      <label for="llo1iwg" class="commentText"><p>Biased. But Knect looks ready, and is exactly the type of player Redick will dial up plays for.  I don&rsquo;t think he cracks the starting rotation, so he won&rsquo;t be rookie of the year. But I can see him ending the year with double figures in points, good rebounding numbers and looking like a more seasoned veteran.</p>

      <label for="lln9vqg" class="commentText"><p>I think Rob Dillingham will be the best player when we look back on the draft in 10 years.  But since he&rsquo;ll be playing behind Conley his first two season he won&rsquo;t be one of the top rookies this year.  I&rsquo;d probably lean Sheppard for rookie of the year, but I do have a good feeling about Isaiah Collier who dropped quite a bit in the draft.</p>
