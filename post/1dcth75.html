      <label for="l82nved" class="commentText"><p>They’ve been a well-organized team for most of their history, but the LA advantage has always been insane. They’ve had probably 4-5 top 10 all-time guys play for the team at least in part because they’re in LA.</p>

<p>It’s also self-fulfilling, because the stars they’ve already attracted built/sustained the legacy as a great franchise, but there’s no way another organization in Minnesota or North Carolina could match that, even with excellent management. What San Antonio has done (while partially lucky with the lottery) is really impressive though.</p>

      <label for="l831rev" class="commentText"><p>Dude try the 1960s.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen so many posts today asking, &ldquo;How do the Lakers get this lucky?&rdquo;  &ldquo;How do they keep failing upwards?&rdquo;  &ldquo;How do they keep doing this?&rdquo;, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a simple and obvious explanation for much of it.   Los Angeles is the celebrity capital of the world and the epicenter of film/television/media.  In the rare instance a basketball player transcends the league and becomes a pop culture icon, the draw of Los Angeles will always be intriguing.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Lakers essentially owe 10 of their 12 championships to this fact.</p>

<p><strong>1968 - Wilt Chamberlain:</strong> Wilt was an established super-duper star playing in Philadelphia.  He had already won 3 MVP awards and a championship.  He outgrew Philly and demanded a trade to LA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Chamberlain felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities, which were plenty in Los Angeles, and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in Los Angeles but hard to imagine elsewhere back then&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This resulted in the 1972 championship</p>

<p><strong>1975 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:</strong> Kareem was an established super-duper star playing in Milwaukee.  He had already won 3 MVP awards and a championship.  He outgrew Milwaukee and demanded a trade to LA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We asked Kareem if there was dissatisfaction with us and he said, no, he just wanted to be traded from Milwaukee,” Embry said. “He said his life style and the life style in Milwaukee were not compatible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The result was another MVP awards, several 1st team all-nba selections and 5 championships.</p>

<p><strong>1996 - Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal:</strong> Shaq was already an established super-duper-star playing in Orlando who only had 4 seasons under his belt yet had already lead his team to the NBA Finals.  He outgrew Orlando and immediately jumped ship to LA via free agency as soon as his rookie contract ended so he could make movies and albums in his free time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shaq referred to playing in Orlando as &ldquo;feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The result was back-to-back-to-back Finals MVP and 3 championships</p>

<p><strong>2018 - LeBron James:</strong> Same story.  LeBron was already an established super-duper star playing in Cleveland who had 3 MVPs and 3 championships under his belt when he decided to join the woeful Lakers.  His media empire, film career, and home were already in LA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rich Paul explained: &ldquo;In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This resulted in the 2020 championship.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>I honestly think this is why Kobe Bryant is as beloved as he is, because the two titles he won in the 2010s were arguably the only 2 out of LA&rsquo;s 12 that didn&rsquo;t come on the backs of another team&rsquo;s established MVP player forcing his way to LA.   Kobe was the rare example of a home grown talent that won a couple titles without the help of another team&rsquo;s MVP-level talent weaseling his way to the Lakers.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s really no other team like that.  There&rsquo;s no example of multiple league MVPs forcing their way to a team to help them win championships.  That advantage really only exists, because once a player reaches a certain level of celebrity, moving to the place where celebrities can feel semi normal is a big draw.  Many NBA stars make their homes in LA despite not even playing for the Lakers.  It&rsquo;s a massive advantage no other team has.</p>

<p><strong>Tl;DR:  Celebrities want to live around other celebrities.  Multiple different established MVP-level mega-star celebrity players left their original team to join LA and were at the epicenter of 10 of LA&rsquo;s 12 title teams</strong></p>

      <label for="l84adwe" class="commentText"><p>Exactly, being a team in Los Angeles is so easy. It&rsquo;s why all of the non-Lakers sports teams in LA also attract <em>so many</em> top tier free agents and win <em>so many</em> championships, am I right? Can you imagine if an NFL team decided that St. Louis was a better market to be in than Los Angeles? I can&rsquo;t even imagine that because that would be crazy!</p>

      <label for="l84290o" class="commentText"><p>Lol at all this nonsense. Wow, you came up with 4 examples over 50 years. Really, that&rsquo;s all there was over 50 years?</p>

<p>Besides, other than perhaps Lebron, these other example were of the lakers outmaneuvering the competition, not some superstar deadset on going to LA. Wilt was traded and it wasn&rsquo;t even the first time he was traded. He was upset at the 76ers because he felt they didn&rsquo;t honor his agreement with their original owner, and wanted to leave. He was given an offer from the lakers but was planning on going to Seattle which brought a much bigger offer. But the lakers found out what the offer was an matched it. He even met with ABA teams before deciding on the Lakers.</p>

<p>Kareem 100% did not demand to go to LA. He demanded a trade to a big city, which included LA, SF, and NY. LA was just the one willing to pay the price to get the trade done.</p>

<p>Shaq wanted to stay in Orlando and this is well reported. Orlando low balled him, and Jerry West took a huge risk in trading away Vlade to clear cap space to increase the laker offer to Shaq. Shaq had already told west his original offer wouldn&rsquo;t be enough. It was no guarantee that Shaq would come, after all, he had just been in the finals with Penny the year before. West thought he would get fired. But it worked out ultimately because Orlando low balled Shaq and he felt disrespected, and west got the offer high enough.</p>

<p>Oh, and there are other examples of the lakers outmaneuvering the competition. Like trading for Pau, or Vlade for Kobe out of HS. Or trading for AD because other teams wouldn&rsquo;t pay the price.</p>

<p>Bottom line is the lakers are the best franchise because they&rsquo;ve been willing to take risks and many have paid off.</p>

      <label for="l81qyvo" class="commentText"><p>The funny thing is we haven&rsquo;t actually hit on that many signings - big time players rarely just sign elsewhere, always seems to be a sign and trade. But the times we did hit were on Lebron and Shaq, probably the two biggest free agents who walked in the last 30 years. But the other great players we&rsquo;ve had over the past few decades were drafted by the team or acquired via trade.</p>

      <label for="l822k89" class="commentText"><p>A lot of sign and trades are with the unwritten understanding that the player is going to be traded to where they want to go. They&rsquo;re doing a sign and trade as a favor to their old team. Not really fair to count those transactions out.</p>

<p>Besides it&rsquo;s not even just the high level signings. Plenty of really talented role players or aging stars have signed with the Lakers to chase a ring at a much lower salary than they&rsquo;d get if like Detroit was paying them. You&rsquo;re also ignoring the fact that the Lakers never have to worry about any of their players who they trade for wanting to be there&hellip;e.g Kawhi peacing out of TOR after one year lol</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve fsure drafted well regardless but every major market has a huge advantage no denying that</p>

<p>Got entirely bailed out due to being in LA.</p>

<p>And they&rsquo;ve continued to suck after their title. Trading for Westbrook was so obviously a terrible move for anyone who wasn&rsquo;t a casual. Especially when the Lakers needed spacing badly and Buddy Hield was available.</p>

<p>Like yeah Buddy has his problems but every GM in the league would take Hield over Westbrook lol.</p>

<p>Lakers picks since 2012 have included Julius Randle, D&rsquo;Angelo Russell, Larry Nance, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Jaden McDaniels. Lakers big signing since 2012 was LEBRON JAMES. Lakers big trade since 2012 was Anthony Davis and we won a ring right after lol. I have my frustrations with our front office sometimes but this is ridiculous</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything to be optimistic about is that Peter O&rsquo;Malley sold the Dodgers because he saw the writing on the wall that a family-owned team couldn&rsquo;t keep up with corporate-owned money.</p>

<p>Even they would find it hard to reject the amount of money they can get for that kind of sale. Plus they can still be minority owners and carry a sufficient amount of prestige being a kind of LA celebroty royalty.</p>

<p>It is literally his job to be responsible for these things.  The only way it could legitimately not be his fault is if he was overridden by his boss.  So is the idea that Jeannie knows she forced him to make bad choices and hence isn&rsquo;t holding him responsible for the fallout of those bad choices?</p>

If the answer is “he’s not responsible for all of that” that’s fine but as an NBA fan I don’t understand how he’s never in the hot seat despite being in a position that is ‘responsible’ for all these type of major decisions.</p>

      <label for="l814868" class="commentText"><p>I actually give them a lot of credit for going after Hurley.</p>

<p>Most NBA teams recycle just been fired NBA coaches. And as much as sometimes the coach isn’t a good fit or is a scapegoat, sometimes you gotta look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Like - anyone who watched UConn at all knows the dude is one of the best basketball coaches in America (if not the best).</p>

<p>Not only are they back to back, they won every game they played in the tournament by double digits. His defense is exceptional and built around his player’s strengths, his offensive system..like..incredible. Lebron has been talking about it for months. (Shit, I’ve heard Lebron compliment him so often, I was like “oh, Bronny is gonna transfer to UConn.” Then this weekend happened, and I went “oh. Oh no.)</p>

<p>The decision to go after Hurley was excellent, and every NBA team should have tried. The problem for the Lakers is that the Lakers coaching job isn’t a better situation than the UConn one, and Hurley built the UConn one.</p>

<p>In the same breath, I’d say that every team with a vacancy should have given Hammon a call, but again..the woman is now coaching a dynasty - that she built - and she has 4 months of work for 2 mil a year. That’s an exceptional work life balance is that going to be tough to beat.</p>

<p>When you go after great coaches, it needs to be a better situation than the one the coach is giving up - or you need to pay enough to make it one.</p>

<p>And the Lakers just didn’t/couldn’t do that.</p>

Woj said we were &lsquo;relentless&rsquo; in our pursuit and people are underestimating his desire to stay where he is.</p>

<p>We almost turned a no into yes, that&rsquo;s a completely different story than failing to do anything here. I&rsquo;d rather be going after the Dan Hurley&rsquo;s than settling for whoever is available.</p>

      <label for="l83po6o" class="commentText"><p>People say this, but superstars rarely change teams in free agency by signing somewhere else. LeBron went to the Lakers in 2019. The last superstar to sign there as a free agent from a different team was Shaq in 1996.</p>

<p>Lakers have had some good players, but it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ve always had the league&rsquo;s top 5 players each year. People were clowning them for the meme players they had the last few seasons, lol.</p>

<p>AD requested a trade there, but that was because LeBron was already there. If the Lakers were still fielding Lonzo, Lance Stephenson, Rondo, and Julius Randle without LeBron, you think he&rsquo;d force his way there?</p>

And even beyond that, just in general, I feel like the idea of tinsel town has lost its luster over the years. The country has developed. In 1965, the US was NY, CHI, LA, with LA being the new, hot place to be. By 1985, other cities had come online. And so the trend went on until now when there are 15-20 &ldquo;happening&rdquo; cities. Do people really care, like Magic and Shaq did, to leave the small town for the bright lights of LA when they aren&rsquo;t in a small town to begin with?</p>

Outside of LeBron if u look at the most watched players a lot of them are in small markets which is something that really wasn&rsquo;t possible even like 10-15 years ago</p>
