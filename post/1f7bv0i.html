Not to mention, if Lebron didn’t give an all time choke performance in that Finals they most likely lose. Glad he did choke though bc I hated those Heat teams and Dirk is one of my favorite players of all time.</p>

<p>You mean when Durant and Westbrook were both 22 years old and James Harden was a 21 year old role player? You&rsquo;re acting like he beat the 2017 versions of those guys all on the same team.</p>

Just more opportunities to get easier baskets.</p>

<p>But that 10-11 Thunder team that lost to the Mavs was still very strong, they won 55 games that season, when they made the Finals the next year they won 47.</p>

They only lost in 2016 because Bogut was injured and the NBA suspended Draymond to extend the series for ad money. They only won in 2017 because Zaza hurt Kawhi. They only won in 2018 because the Rockets went 7-44 from 3 in G7. They only lost in 2019 because Klay and Durant were injured. They only lost in 2020 and 2021 because Klay was injured. They only won in 2022 because Middleton was injured. Full strength Bucks sweep them.</p>

<p>None of these rings count. The only ring that actually counts in NBA history is 1970 when the Knicks beat the Lakers in the Finals despite Willis Reed being injured.</p>

That was just a pure choke. You think LeBron had never played with a center before 2011?</p>

<p>As a die hard heat fan I hated Dirk and KG.</p>

<p>Only after they retired, I realized I didn&rsquo;t hate them. They were amazing competitors that were a thorn in my teams side and when they were gone, something was missing.</p>

<p>I went back and watched so much film of those 2 guys that my hate turned to admiration.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m just a fan of the game. Sometimes you have to fall down to get up again and Dirk showed that to the Miami Heat.</p>

<p>Wade&rsquo;s shot rimming out at the end of game 2 an all-time great what if to me. He came so close to hitting it, and just erasing one of the greatest comebacks of ever. People viewed LeBron and Dirk so much differently than they would have if Wade hit that shot, and it changed the rest of their careers. </p>

<p>This year, while everyone here said OKC and Min Would dominate Dallas, after Dallas won the narrative was that OKC was just too young and refs cheated. And then that the Wolves were just tired and the Mavs didnt actually earn it.</p>

<p>But shocker, when they DID lose, all credit to Boston and now the narrative is Luka isn’t that good and you can never win with him.</p>

<p>it had nothing to do with your turn my turn, after going 9-8, they finished the season going 61-19 before getting to the finals, pretty fucking dominant, and that was with a D level crew behind the big three</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m a lebron is the goat guy, but they lost cause he choked, but it gets very weird to me the way people talk about those heat teams, like oh wade needed to take a step back! they were dominant with Wade still getting his numbers, Wade took a step back because his knees were not meant to play that many games, and also, even with taking a step back, taking games off, his playoffs after 2011 clearly showed that his knees kept giving out, he was getting his knees drained mid playoffs in 2012</p>
