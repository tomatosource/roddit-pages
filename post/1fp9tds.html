      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fp9tds/does_jalen_smith_supplant_nikola_vucevic_as/"><p>Does Jalen Smith supplant Nikola Vucevic as starting C for the Bulls this season?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think we all know the talk surrounding Vooch and his level of play. He had what was probably his worst season since emerging as a top 20 C. Outside of a 30 game stretch two seasons ago to start the year he has been consistently a high-20s/low-30s 3 point shooter the last three seasons. He really tailed off the second half of <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> and didn&rsquo;t recover last year. He is still a good midrange shooter and is still a solid post option but his finishing in the PnR and finishing in general took a hit last year and he&rsquo;s getting to the line less and less.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still a good rebounder but he was less good than his norm which takes a big chunk of his value away defensively. Defensive rebounding is his biggest strength on that end.</p>

<p>If you give him touches and let him work in the post and in his comfort zones in the midrange, he&rsquo;ll still contribute offensively, but that cuts against what Billy Donovan wants from the offense. He wasn&rsquo;t efficient in the post last season but I do think some of that is the circumstances surrounding him vs his own ability, because he was decent in the post as recently as in <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>. He has complained about not getting touches in his comfort zone quite a bit, and perhaps with DeMar out of the picture we see him featured more. He seems like someone you have to actively feature to get the most out of, but he may not be valuable enough to deserve that role at this point.</p>

<p>Bulls are in a rebuild, and Vucevic is someone they want to move. He was signed to a 3/<span class="math inline">\(60M deal in the 2023 offseason that now seems ill fated. Jalen Smith was signed to a 3/\)</span>27M deal early in free agency to replace Andre Drummond as backup C for the Bulls, and potentially even serve as their C of the future down the line. He&rsquo;s a very good offensive rebounder. He&rsquo;s a strong finisher and looks to dunk whatever he can, hence the nickname Stix. He&rsquo;s a below average defender overall&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t offer much as a shot blocker, doesn&rsquo;t have the strength to consistently defend C&rsquo;s, not always locked in or disciplined and gets in foul trouble&mdash;but he did shoot over 40% from 3 and has really worked hard on that part of his game.</p>

<p>Jalen with his mobility, his finishing ability, and the burgeoning shooting, along with the fact he&rsquo;s 24 and Vooch is 34, seems to potentially be a better fit right now with the Bulls young core and also with Zach LaVine. Do you think he ends up supplanting Vooch in the starting lineup this season for the Bulls?</p>

      <label for="lovxn1x" class="commentText"><p>I think Vucevic&rsquo;s playing time is safe for this season, the team will likely be looking to preserve his value and Smith will take a bit of time to adjust to the new team.</p>

<p>My guess is they&rsquo;ll try to trade him in the offseason as he&rsquo;ll be an expiring contract. Salary cap will be going up next year by quite a bit (10%) due to new TV contract kicking in, so it will be easier to move him then as his salary will be less of a cap burden (lower % of cap).</p>

      <label for="lovwdzz" class="commentText"><p>Maybe? At the same time, if you put Vooch on the bench it makes it a lot harder for him to recoup his trade value. At that point, you are kind of abandoning your ability to trade him at the deadline and trying again next off-season when he&rsquo;s an expiring contract.</p>
