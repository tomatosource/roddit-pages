</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>Player #1</strong><br>
Position: Small Forward<br>
NBA comparison: Jalen Rose/Lamar Odom</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: It’s not every season that the NBA welcomes in a 6’9&rdquo; point guard.  In fact, the comparisons to Magic Johnson have already begun for this kid…Has great floor vision thanks to his height and his instincts…Thanks to his size advantage over most of his match ups, he’s able to post up on smaller guards or throw entry passes right over their heads…Despite his lack of speed and acceleration he is able to get past normal-sized point guards with his long strides…Great at leading the break.  Finds a lot of good looks for himself and his teammates in transition…Good outside shooter who has made massive improvements to his jump shot since his freshman year. His long arms make him a terror in the passing lanes at the point of attack.  He is perhaps the best rebounding guard in the nation… Great at using spin moves and head fakes to make up for his lack of speed and create a shot for himself…Has the size and skill-set to play three or four positions…Has great floor vision in addition to the ability to see over the head of his defender…A very intelligent player who knows how to set up his teammates and make good, pro-caliber plays.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: He is hampered by his lack of elite-level athleticism.  He has a below-average first step and lateral quickness…May find it difficult to defend smaller players when he plays guard…Still has trouble creating a shot for himself at times…Needs to add strength to his skinny frame as he often struggles to finish through contact…Has improved as a shooter, but still struggles with his shot from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &amp;gt;!-&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Kyle Anderson&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-!&amp;lt;</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>Player #2</strong><br>
Position: Point Guard<br>
NBA comparison: Jalen Brunson</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Fearless competitor and big game performer at the point guard position … High percentage three-point shooter with limitless range … Excellent shooter in the catch-and-shoot game … Sees the court very well and is an accurate passer… Fearless and an inspirational leader … Efficient scorer at the free throw line … Takes care of the ball well even with his high usage rate … Athletic two-way player who averaged over a steal per game in his career … Dynamic scorer both on the drive and from beyond the arc … Can create his own shot with above average ball-handling, a fluid shooting motion and limitless range … Can play both on ball point guard and off-screen sharpshooter … High motor player who shows up when he is needed … Consistent player who never seems to disappear even on off-shooting nights, finding ways to contribute and help his team win … Shows leadership and mental toughness, a desire to compete and doesn’t get rattled easily … Decent size at the point guard position … Proved to be a clutch performer in big games and situations.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Despite high free-throw percentage, he struggles to draw fouls and get to the line … One of the older point guards in the draft … Foot speed limits his defensive ability at the next level to some degree … His shot selection is often inconsistent and sometimes reckless, but this could improve as his usage rate goes down … His ceiling in his first couple years is a quality minute role player … His speed, athleticism, and physical profile could make for a difficult transition to the next level … Could struggle against speedy point guards … Can be a little careless with the ball at times, but seemed to improve with ball security as his college career progressed.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &amp;gt;!-&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Payton Pritchard&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-!&amp;lt;</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>Player #3</strong><br>
Position: Small Forward<br>
NBA comparison: Nicolas Batum</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: He’s able to change directions off the dribble and with the ball in his hands with incredible smoothness and quickness, getting to the rim while maintaining excellent balance … His athleticism and wingspan make him able to cover 4 positions on the floor, showing great versatility … He has a natural feel for the game and a good basketball IQ, with good passing skills and instincts and the potential to become a point forward at the next level … Thanks to his big hands and his creativity, he’s an amazing ball handler for his position … He’s unstoppable with momentum, especially during secondary transition, when he can exploit his amazing mobility starting from the dribble … He shows good potential to improve as a shooter even if it’s his main shortcoming at the moment … On the defensive end he has great instincts in the passing lanes and in help situations, often with perfect timing for blocks from the blind side … With his physical tools he could easily guard opposing wings, showing the potential to defend both guards and power forwards, depending match ups.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Without question he has a large basement to go with his large ceiling … Despite his athletic abilities he lacks elite explosiveness … His game off the ball is rather weak, especially related to spacing and use of screens and cuts, in fact most of his offensive production happens with the ball in his hands … The only exception is when he’s slashing to the basket for put backs or on the break … On the defensive side, he needs to learn the basis, since he’s beaten by the opponents due a lack of proper positioning and comprehension … The overall impression is of a raw prospect from basketball comprehension standpoint, whose is based on instincts, talent, physical gifts and natural feel for the game.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &amp;gt;!-&mdash;&mdash;Giannis Antetokounmpo&mdash;&mdash;!&amp;lt;</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>Player #4</strong><br>
Position: Point Guard/Shooting Guard<br>
NBA comparison: n/a</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: A combo guard who excels playing at a high pace … He likes to keep the pressure on the defense by looking to attack in transition … Has good length and a very impressive 37’ max vert … His jumper is smooth and he has a very compact and efficient release … He has shot a good percentage from beyond the arc during his college career as well as overseas … Plays with a lot of confidence and is not afraid to make the big play … Attacks contact and knows how to draw fouls … Off the dribble he is dangerous due to his solid handle as well as his ability to turn the corner and explode … As a defender, his energy and quickness make him a pest and he is also able to use his long arms to disrupt the passing lanes … As a rebounder he is extremely good, because he is willing to get to the glass, but also because of his leaping ability as well as good anticipation.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Plays with a scorer’s mentality and does not have the natural playmaking ability that a player at his size must have … In the pick and roll he struggles reading the action and making the plays when the defense rotates … Struggles finishing over bigger help defenders … His light frame makes it difficult for him to attack stronger guards and it also gives him trouble defending because he gets bodied out of position … After a solid freshman year at the line, he has struggled shooting from the charity stripe during his last 2 seasons.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &amp;gt;!-&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Patrick Beverly&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;!&amp;lt;</p>

<p>The second comparison isn&rsquo;t bad imo. Keep in mind Jalen Brunson averaged 8 ppg the year this was written</p>
