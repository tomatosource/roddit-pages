That was the redemption fuck you playoff performance for the ages. Like yes, I fucking will drag this team to a championship and I can do this without another superstar by my side.

      <label for="ln630ii" class="commentText"><p>I think you could argue Jokic and Giannis had even bigger legacy impacts with their runs. Curry at least won before. Sure, there were a lot of people clamoring that he got carried by KD. But he was still regarded an all timer at the PG position and one of the best players of this generation.</p>

<p>Jokic and Giannis both won back to back MVPs with disappointing playoff exits and had a lot of people shouting that they were too flawed to lead their team to championships(Giannis could not shoot and Jokic couldn&rsquo;t play any defense). Both of their respective runs put those conversations in the closet for good.</p>

      <label for="ln64i4s" class="commentText"><p>Fair, I can see that argument as well. I just think it ended all the ridiculous asterisks discussions around Curry. The counter argument is that Jokic would be viewed like Embiid had he not got one. So an absolute disaster for his legacy</p>

      <label for="ln64830" class="commentText"><p>What lmao? Honestly I never seen a fan base discredit their roster outside of their star player as much as Nuggets do with Jokic and the Nuggets. Even Warrior fans would say Wiggins Poole and Looney played their best basketball in that run. Laker fans and bucks fan credit their top players as well and their role players. Nugget fans are different though in that regard Jokic was playing with MPJ, Aaron Gordon, Jamal Murray, KCP, Bruce Brown, and other solid role players even their rookie had some nice minutes. Nuggets roster were definitely at the very top compared to others.</p>

      <label for="ln64l5p" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re great players..what I am saying is consider AG&rsquo;s reputation in Orlando vs Denver. No one considered him an elite role player until he played with Jokic. It&rsquo;s not hating on them to acknowledge that.</p>

<p>These players are only considered elite role players cause they play with Jokic. They wouldn&rsquo;t be considered an elite cast or roleplayers if they didn&rsquo;t have Jokic elevating their games.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really not a crazy opinion dude. Like I said the role players of the nuggets have literally zero accolades amongst them. They would not be considered elite role players if they were in Washington. It&rsquo;s Jokic himself that helps with that reputation. Same reason Will Barton was considered a fine enough NBA player with Jokic and is in China two years from then.</p>

<p>Saying that the nuggets outside of Jokic was undeniably a top two set of role players in the league is just kinda impossible to say cause they wouldn&rsquo;t be considered that elite if not for him. That&rsquo;s just true</p>

      <label for="ln67af1" class="commentText"><p>That’s the point though the players around Jokic are perfect to complement a star player. And like Jokic elevated them they complemented him but they honestly complement any star player. And AG reputation in Orlando was he was doing more than he is capable of we never seen AG in that 3rd-4th player role that’s a huge difference and it’s not like he was scouted to be a bad player in Orlando. Any team without their star players does bad the only one we have seen that not stand true for is the Celtics that’s why they were are top 2.</p>

<p>Not downplaying Giannis. But if you&rsquo;re saying 32/13/4 was a carry job in one series, then Jokic had an even greater carry job for the entirety of the playoffs. Giannis also went 30/13/5 in the entirety of the playoffs. His run was clearly great too. The difference 5 extra assists per game makes is huge though.</p>

      <label for="ln66emp" class="commentText"><p>No one mentioned Jokic? Lol y’all Jokic stans are unbearable sometimes.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a carry job because of the stats he put up, it was a carry job because the rest of his team wasn’t doing shit. Jrue shot like ass, Brook shot like ass, Khris had 1 or 2 decent games. Portis and Lopez both were played off the floor a lot. Jokic had Murray average 33 ppg in the wcf.</p>

<p>I’ve always said Jokic had the better run as a whole but Giannis had the better finals.</p>

<p>But again, not a single thing about Jokic was mentioned in my original comment, there was 0 need to bring him up.</p>

<p>Hell Thanasis and Teague had to get minutes.</p>

<p>They had to play Thanasis and Teague a few minutes to give the starters rest because Forbes, Lopez and Portis were being abused on defense.</p>

      <label for="ln6hsw7" class="commentText"><p>All four runs were incredible so it&rsquo;s crazy to see 2020 LeBron last, but yeah I mean Lebron&rsquo;s run was kinda average by his career standards (again, crazy to say). He&rsquo;s had many more mind-blowing runs than that.</p>

<p>Giannis&rsquo;s 35 ppg in the finals against a pretty good Suns team and 50 point closeout puts it over the edge. He also carried the Bucks hard over the Nets in the 2nd round and played through a knee injury in the ECF and Finals.</p>

<p>Curry was just insanely clutch in 2022 and dragged that Warriors squad to the chip, which really didn&rsquo;t have a ton of talent tbh. His supporting cast was post-ACL tear Klay, Draymond, Poole, and Wiggins. Took down a pretty great Celtics squad in the finals as well. It was the most impressive run when you look at how far he dragged that team even if the numbers of the other guys were a bit better.</p>

<p>Jokic&rsquo;s run was overall incredible, but I just docked it for how weak the field was last year. The Suns series was incredible though and Jokic dominated the whole way.</p>

<p>Giannis- came back from injury and down 0-2 against the higher seed and had a 50 piece close out game. Had a crazy series against the nets</p>

<p>Lebron- went through Jimmy butler, Jokic, Jamal, Harden, Russ, Dame. Not the craziest run by any means but not the worst</p>

<p>Curry- beat multiple injured teams and the Celtics were pretty inexperienced, Tatum was barely turned 24 years old for example</p>

<p>In terms of opponents it’d be Lebron/Steph/Giannis/Jokic (I think the last 3 are interchangeable, all 3 dealt with some injured/weak opponents)</p>

<p>I’d probably go overall</p>

<p>Jokic/Giannis</p>

<p>Jokic/Giannis</p>

<p>LeBron</p>

<p>Steph</p>

<p>But it feels wrong to put Steph last as well so I dunno lol I think they are all very close. But as non bias as I can be, I think Giannis finals was the most dominant of the 4 with Jokic next.</p>

      <label for="ln696w5" class="commentText"><p>I mean if we are going do this then yes.</p>

<p>Bron- below .500 team, 4th seed Rockets with a 6’7 centre, young Nuggets (coming off two 7 game series) injured 5th seeded Heat.</p>

<p>I think using just seeds doesn’t really add much but the Lakers didn’t face a bunch of elite teams. I don’t really think any of the four faced a bunch an elite teams but I think the Nuggets faced the toughest teams up until the finals where they faced the easiest of any of the four. The Nuggets were just so elite that everyone has confidence themselves all the teams that year sucked because of their seed.</p>

<p>The suns had Kd and Booker for like 11-12 games, cp3 was out and Ayton missed a game (or 2) outside of those 4 guys it was a bunch of bums.</p>

<p>Lakers had Bron injured and again, just weren’t a good team. Everyone swore they’d be a top 4-5 seed the following season but they weren’t. Not to mention their coach had 0 clue on what to do.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how you say those are tough opponents.</p>

      <label for="ln6jikd" class="commentText"><p>The Wolves were better than the Blazers I don’t think this should be an argument. Plus if we are including what happens the following season the Wolves are the best team out of the bunch. The Blazers were Dame, CJ and bums as you put it. Not only did the Wolves win way more games they did so while missing their second best player speaking to the strength of the rest of the roster.</p>

<p>The Rockets were a horrible built team that had to trade their third best player in Clint Capela because of how awful the spacing was. Then they started a 6’7 PJ Tucker at five that’s not a team that’s trying to win games at a high level. Yes the Suns were throw together mid season but they were on fire as soon as the trade happened and geld quickly. I don’t think ether team was very deep but the Suns had a legit five and KD and Booker are a better duo than Russ and Harden. There a reason why people picked them to win the chip after the trade.</p>

<p>I think both the Lakers and Nuggets are very comparable. Both were ran down by the team they made the conference finals. I think you can pick or choose which team was better I don’t think Bron being hurt is that big of a factor considering he played 48 minutes in game four and looked fine. If you want to say the Nuggets are the better team sure I don’t think there’s much of a gap.</p>

<p>The 2020 Heat were definitely better than the 2023 Heat at full strength. That Isn’t the team the Lakers faced through. Dragic their second leading scorer and second or third best player got hurt game 1 and Bam their best defender and their second or third best player also got hurt game one. Bam would come back later but if your going say Bron was injured and it makes a difference than you can’t act like Bam wasn’t injured and not at full strength. The 2023 Heat were mostly healthy when they reached Denver just lacking Herro. I think both teams are very close to each other with the 2023 Heat getting the slight edge due to their top two being fully healthy and comparable depth.</p>

<p>If you disagree that’s ok, I think both teams faced very similar competition with the Nuggets just facing better teams in round one and two so they get the edge in my eyes.</p>

      <label for="ln65kr0" class="commentText"><p>That’s fine, but on the other hand the Nuggets played a Suns team that got Durant at the deadline and a Lakers team that was far better after their deadline moves. Neither of those seeds were really representative of the talent on the team.</p>

      <label for="ln628zb" class="commentText"><p>Jokic&amp;gt;Giannis&amp;gt;Lebron&amp;gt;Curry. Dominance factor needs to be considered who is the best player in a series. Curry and Giannis had instances were they were not the best player on a series, like Giannis vs KD in the 2021 Nets series and the Curry vs Jokic in the 2022 Nuggets series.  Bron, though very dominant wasnt THAT dominant. I consired Jokic&rsquo;s run as the most dominant because in that run, everyone in the NBA could clearly see that there was just no team in the play offs stopping the Nuggets train being led by a 30/13/10 player, he was just head and shoulders above everyone during that run.</p>
