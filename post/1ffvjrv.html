</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I see a lot of the time in nba discourse where the vast majority of fans believe a player’s offense and defense hold the same value, or <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>. I dont think this is true at all. I believe offense is about 70-80% of a player’s value compared to their defense.</p>

<p>It seems pretty simple to me. It’s must easier to prevent a great defensive player from impacting the game than a great offensive player. Avoiding defensive players is pretty simple, whereas keeping the ball out of one offensive player is insanely difficult.</p>

<p>And this is especially the case in the context of perimeter players. Unlike rim protectors who will pretty much always be influencing multiple players as the first helper, perimeter players much more rarely provide help defense. So they are limited to affecting <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of the players while on offense they can create numerous advantages.</p>

<p>This isnt to understate the value of team defense of course. A team’s defense is historically much more necessary in winning championships than their offense. But people claiming “x player is better than y because there are two sides to basketball” even though offense is much more valuable needs to stop. I think jokic being the best player in the league has started opening eyes to this, but even still many people still blindly say embiid or giannis are better solely because of defense.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not alone, feels like 90% of nephews think this.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not 50-50, but 70-80%? No. If you&rsquo;re in the bottom 20-30% of the league on defense, someone else is covering your ass. The best players play both sides of the court.</p>

      <label for="lmxk2au" class="commentText"><p>Though I do think the consensus is that Jokic is the best player in the NBA, I don&rsquo;t think the argument against that was ever solely on defense. Jokic, Giannis, and Embiid are all very dominant offensive players. Yes Jokic is better offensively, but the other 2 dominate on that end too. They just also dominate on the defensive end as well.</p>

<p>To counter your point a little bit too, we see elite score first point guards all the time in the NBA, but how often do they lead a team to a championship? Is it just Curry in the past 30 years?</p>

<p>Alternatively, how often are champions led by 2-way wings? I would say most years in recent memory. At the very least the 2nd best player is a 2-way wing.</p>

<p>Go look at Finals MVP winners and you&rsquo;ll find that the vast majority of them are good defensively.</p>

      <label for="lmxjnid" class="commentText"><p>Obviously i agree.</p>

<p>The thing about the NBA is that its a team sport, even with how it feels so focused on individual abilities.</p>

<p>Guys can cover for each others weaknesses, other teams can have mediocre offensive players that teams can stick their worse defenders on, teams can just hide worse defenders through a good scheme or straight up find a way to use them so that they can be good.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves are an amazing example of this. Sure KAT has improved as a defender, but for good chunks of his carrier he was getting critisism for not being a great defender. But with Gobert, the dude has been able to really shine on defense cause Gobert has his back.</p>

<p>I will say that you dont want too many poor defenders on your team. Most of the time you wanna pair them with an excelent defender near them, like how Steoh had Klay or how Jokic has AG.</p>

<p>Most of the time though people also dont realise that guarding the other teams best player can be super draining and if your best offensive player is guarding the other teams best offensive player, then they will get drained quickly cause they are doing too much. Which is why youd prefer a roleplayer to be your best defender for certain positions.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t entirely agree here. So many NBA offenses are now based around forcing switches. So a single bad perimeter defender can still be a big liability on every possession when a team decides to attack him. So that bad perimeter defender might be just defender one or two players per possession, but if they are attacked every play, it doesn&rsquo;t really make a difference</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Offense being more valuable than defense doesn&rsquo;t mean defense isn&rsquo;t a big part of a players value. Idk many people who would disagree that in 2024, offense is more valuable. But, when we are talking about guys like Jokic and Giannis, their offensive contributions are much closer than their ability on defense. So its  a very fair thing to bring up if you think Giannis is better. This also isn&rsquo;t a new thing that Jokic made people realize, this is a discussion thats been going on for years at least.</p>

      <label for="lmxjcws" class="commentText"><p>Individual defense is overrated, because even the greatest defender in history isn&rsquo;t able to magically teleport through a screen, or unable to guard two people at once if your teammate messes up his coverage</p>

<p>It does get slightly less overrated the higher you go in the roster though in my opinion for example a great defensive center can carry a defense alot more than a great defensive point guard can.</p>

      <label for="lmxjhr1" class="commentText"><p>I mean people may say things like that but it&rsquo;s pretty clear how teams view it with the contracts given. Typically a &ldquo;defense only player&rdquo; won&rsquo;t make as much as a highly skilled offensive player. And obviously the highest players are usually the ones that can do everything great.</p>

<p>I think the bigger issue is most fans don’t really understand defense in general and it’s extremely reputation based especially for perimeter players. It is also <em>heavily</em> affected by roles and schemes</p>

<p>Just watching my team over this past year has made me done complete 180s on my defensive opinion on couple players.</p>
