      <label for="lg98dj0" class="commentText"><p>You gotta know that the burden of proof is on the accuser, not the accused. Kobe didn’t need to prove he didn’t do it, the prosecution needed to prove he did. Death threats and the public backlash against the accuser are terrible and should never happen but they don’t make him more guilty and it ain’t reflective of what happened in the hotel room. Condemning without proof is a horrible act</p>

      <label for="lg98nel" class="commentText"><p>Yeah except for the fact that legal settlements don’t mean guilt. People just wanna end court battles. Saying Kobe got off because of fan threats ignores nuance and how the world works. Settling means nothing. He followed his lawyers advice and right or wrong, it’s not reflective of what did or didn’t happen</p>

<p>The story goes that Vujačić use to talk shit to Kobe in Slovenian and Serbian while Kobe shouted Italian insults during heated practice. After practice, and once things cooled down , an interested Kobe would ask Sasha what certain words meant and remember them.</p>

<p>Kobe WAS Los Angeles. It amazes me how much hate he gets and people thinking they don’t need this statue. The run he had with LA was absolutely amazing. LeBron is a great player but I just don’t feel the same as I did with Kobe and the lakers.</p>

<p>Kobe wanted to win and was so passionate about the team and city. Given what happened and the fact that the last image was him and his daughter at the game. This is beyond well deserved.</p>

<p>Shame on anyone trashing this.</p>

<p>By a woman who bragged about sleeping with other celebs like eminem and had another man&rsquo;s semen on her underwear the day after she was &ldquo;raped&rdquo;.  And got caught lieing about it twice.  First saying she didnt sleep with anyone, then after the dna results changing her story to i slept with someone before Kobe (which the defense medical expert said was not possible because she also had semen on her legs and none was anywhere near anything that kobe&rsquo;s dna was on).  Just google the NYTimes article on it.  I actually was old enough to read the papers and watch the news when this all happened.</p>

<p>Because the stuff I read was pretty rapey and crazy honestly. I mean Kobe had a girl and was cheating his ass off like a bitch, something else I fucking hate men and women for doing.</p>

<p>Even if he was just banging this chick, it still feels really nasty and gross and not something I&rsquo;d be okay with.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;re unlikely to find &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of anything really because the trial never happened as the DA dropped all charges with prejudice before the trial began. As such all there really is are news outlets getting quotes from people that we&rsquo;ll never know if they were credible or not (like the accuser&rsquo;s classmates), and accidental leaks from the courthouse itself of deposition transcripts.</p>

<p>There really wasn&rsquo;t even &ldquo;propaganda from lawyers&rdquo;, it was just that some of the depositions got inadvertently posted to the court&rsquo;s website by the court itself, and in those we got to see what lawyers had said behind closed doors in what were supposed to be private settings. Most people here weren&rsquo;t alive when that happened, and for the rest of us it was 20 years ago, but there&rsquo;s so many things that are attributed as statements made by lawyers to the press that were actually private comments made that then <a href="https://archive.ph/wj9Y5" target="_blank">had the transcripts leaked.</a></p>

<p>Like Kobe&rsquo;s lawyer using the accuser&rsquo;s name? That was in a closed door hearing, and the judge had her name stricken from the record, but the transcript was leaked to the press. Or the accuser&rsquo;s rape kit exam, that too was inadvertently mailed to a number of press outlets by the court. People nowadays think Kobe&rsquo;s lawyers were introducing evidence in press conferences, but that kind of thing would get a lawyer disbarred and removed from the case if anyone ever did that. The truth was it was a small town courthouse that wasn&rsquo;t in any way ready for the scrutiny that trial was going to cause, and they made mistakes, and the press ran with all of it.</p>

<p>The reality is neither side got to make their case in court, and the civil case was settled without going to trial. None of us really knows anything for sure, everyone just likes to pretend that they know what happened, whatever side they&rsquo;re on.</p>

There were several people that were friends of the girl that said she was bragging about sleeping with other celebs and also defendant lawyers engaged a medical expert that said there was another person&rsquo;s semen on her underwear and that it was not possible for that semen to have been there before the alleged rape.</p>

<p>The case was extremely murky at best, but reddit being reddit decides Kobe was guilty and if you think differently, you&rsquo;re just downvoted.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reddit nba post about all the facts of the case that lean towards Kobe&rsquo;s innocence.</p>

<p>But 90% of the people on this sub wouldnt change their minds or opinions about Kobe even if there was video evidence of consent.</p>

<p>But yeah I do tend to think this girl wanted something, but she got more than what she bargained for and Kobe started treating her like some hooker and she wasn&rsquo;t about that.</p>

<p>Still definitely rape I guess in our society anyway. She got paid regardless. Some say about 2-3million.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s also a fucking bitch for doing this to Shaq:</p>

<p>According to the police report, while he was being questioned by the officers about the alleged sexual assault, Bryant said, “I should have done what Shaq does,” adding, “Shaq gives them money or buys them cars, he has already spent one million dollars.” The report added, “Kobe stated that Shaq does this to keep the girls quiet.”</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s okay to call a dead person a rapist, but it&rsquo;s not okay to defend them or have an opinion contrary to the reddit echo chamber that a world exists where he wasnt guilty?</p>

      <label for="lg7tura" class="commentText"><p>are you saying a person who has sex with someone else can&rsquo;t be raped? Dunlocke may think it&rsquo;s slut shaming cause it sounded like you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;how can she have been raped when she had sex with someone else as well&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lg94ysl" class="commentText"><p>The case never actually went to trial, so we&rsquo;ll never know how this would have played out, but what Kobe&rsquo;s defense was probably trying to do was use the existence of another man&rsquo;s semen in her rape kit exam to raise reasonable doubt that the results of her exam could have been contaminated if she&rsquo;d had a sexual encounter with someone else in between her encounter with Kobe and the exam, sort of like &ldquo;tampering with evidence&rdquo;, as it were. Like I said, it never went to trial, but I&rsquo;m guessing Kobe&rsquo;s lawyers would have moved for the exam results to be inadmissible, but who can say how the judge would have ruled on that.</p>

<p>Really all the digging people do into the specifics of the case are pointless since there never was a trial, so we never got to see evidence entered or hear testimony. All we have are a couple inadvertently leaked transcripts of closed door pretrial depositions, but that&rsquo;s obviously incomplete and inconclusive. We don&rsquo;t know anything, the case was dismissed without a trial, and the civil case was settled before going to trial as well.</p>

      <label for="lg7utf9" class="commentText"><p>Im saying it&rsquo;s very unlikely that someone who was raped would be in the state of mind to want to have sex with someone else within 24 hours of being raped?  That&rsquo;s common sense and it&rsquo;s crazy that I even need to type it out.</p>

<p>Not only that but she initially lied about it too.  She said she didnt have sex with anyone else before or after the rape, then changed her story to - &ldquo;i had sex with someone before Kobe&rdquo; once the dna showed another man&rsquo;s semen, but medical experts claimed that the dna testing proved that it was impossible that 2nd sexual encounter happened before.  So she got caught lieing about the whole thing twice.</p>

<p>So it puts into question her entire credibility.  Among other factos in the case.</p>

<p>Thats not slut shaming.  There&rsquo;s just kobe hate boners that want to claim it is.  And most of those haters are always women, utah jazz fans, or lebron stans.  It&rsquo;s actually very predictable anytime this stuff gets posted.</p>

When someone changes their story and gets caught lying multiple times, brags to her friends about having sex with other celebs like eminem, is witnessed to leaving the hotel without any visible trauma or crying, refuses to testify, then drops the case all together after these facts come to light - and you still somehow have 100% conviction to call him a rapist is indeed moronic.</p>

He stuck it in her ass and violently raped her to the point of blood leakage when she didn’t want that and admitted that later. Nothing you said makes me think that didn’t happen.</p>

<p>Edit: aww he has to block so I can’t respond lmao. What I was gonna say: “If you don’t see things my way then you should never be on a jury” just childish hero worship and narcissism. Of course it wouldn’t violate the laws of physics for it all to be bogus but it seems extremely unlikely.</p>

The fact that some of you cant imagine any scenario where he even could be remotely innocent is why you should never serve on a jury.  Youre probably the type of moron that plays mafia with friends and makes up their mind completely about who the killers are after a single round and then are dumbfounded when they are wrong.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not even saying hes 100% innocent - just that calling him a rapist in this thread is fucked up consideing his case was murky and eventually was dropped.</p>

      <label for="lg7zij4" class="commentText"><p>The DNA argument goes both ways. Kobe had her dried blood on his shirt, and the incident occurred 2 weeks after her period so it’s most likely not menstrual blood. He also admitted to strangling her (with alleged body language consent) and bending her over a chair, which is apparently the position the blood came from (and when she allegedly revoked consent).</p>

<p>Also, she had another guys semen on her underwear but tests couldn’t tell how old the semen was. It could’ve been a dirty pair of underwear. The defense argued it happened after Kobe but that’s not a guarantee </p>

<p>If you’re gonna get this defensive about an opinion at least give the facts in good faith </p>

      <label for="lg81n1p" class="commentText"><p>Congrats you did the bare minimum and read the wikipage on the case.  On the other hand, I followed the case closely when it actually happened because im not 16 years old like most of this subreddit.  And it was highly impluasible that the semen was from a partner before the incident per medical experts.  Also it doesnt address the fact that she initially lied about it.  If youre going to get defensive about my opinion and least do proper research in good faith and not just blindly copy and paste a wikipage.</p>

<p>** &ldquo;Prosecutors maintain that old, dry semen from the second man on the yellow underwear accounted for its presence on the various samples.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson said that theory was not plausible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think is would be highly coincidental for someone in the act of putting on underwear to make three separate circular spots on their thighs,&rdquo; she testified in June.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is highly unlikely to explain how that material got internally,&rdquo; she continued. Dr. Johnson added that if sex with the second man had preceded the encounter with Mr. Bryant, some of the second man&rsquo;s genetic material would have been found on Mr. Bryant and his clothing.&rdquo; **</p>

      <label for="lg94c0e" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s because her vagina was technically a &ldquo;crime scene&rdquo; when she went for the rape kit exam. If that test showed she&rsquo;d had sex with someone in between her encounter with Kobe and being examined, it casts doubt on which partner could have caused any trauma discovered. It doesn&rsquo;t mean Kobe didn&rsquo;t rape her, but his defense lawyers probably could have used that to get her rape kit exam deemed inadmissible at the trial. But of course the DA dismissed all the charges before there ever was a trial, so we&rsquo;ll never know how a judge would have ruled on that, nor what a jury would have thought of any of it.</p>

<p>Admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”</p>

<p>-Kobe Bryant, after the criminal case was dismissed (meaning he was protected from further prosecution due to double jeopardy)</p>

<p>You know who probably wouldn&rsquo;t like you brushing off sexual assault with &ldquo;Yeah, but the girl was just a slut anyways&rdquo;? The guy who had 4 daughters.</p>

<p>I like to think Kobe grew out of that &ldquo;boys will be boys, we men - you can assume&rdquo; mindset. I hope you do too.</p>

      <label for="lg7g7v3" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m actually surprised at how hard they gloss over this considering we tear down statues of all kinds of other people for random shit.</p>

<p>Man reading all those court documents, it was pretty clear the dude definitely raped her IMO, at least by today&rsquo;s standard, but that she also was apparently consensual at first.</p>

<p>What I think happened is that she was used to gentlemen here if she did anything at her work before. And this was not one of those encounters. Kobe is straight up treating her like a club hoe of the cheapest variety. And yeah that will verge on rape with a lot of people no doubt.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s why they had the lawyers try to make her look like some fucking bimbo hooker from a club. She was just working her shift at a resort in Colorado for fuck&rsquo;s sake! How seriously celeb crazy could this chick possibly be? I could her sleeping with a star at her work for sure, but to just randomly have this happen seems a bit much? Way more like you know&hellip; rape lol?</p>

<p>But what I really hated about it all is he threw Shaq under the fucking bus for no reason after cheating on his wife and getting way too deep with some random chick:</p>

<p>According to the police report, while he was being questioned by the officers about the alleged sexual assault, Bryant said, “I should have done what Shaq does,” adding, “Shaq gives them money or buys them cars, he has already spent one million dollars.” The report added, “Kobe stated that Shaq does this to keep the girls quiet.”</p>

If she did not care enough to take it trial then why should care enough that she claims she was raped? He did not rape her. She was full of shit and was caught in numerous lies. I am surprised people are still pretending she was credible. If you were raped you want them punished not just their money. Fucking duh</p>

<p>Kobe was a rapist and never saw time for doing so, its as fucking sad as big ben and adrian peterson.  Athletes and the rich get away with illegal crimes way too often. Its really sad y&rsquo;all idolize him, esp giving a sexual assaulter a statue.</p>

You can&rsquo;t possibly be too stupid to know that so I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re just trolling because you&rsquo;ve a sad life.</p>
