      <label for="lix6n6c" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s weird because I genuinely do think he is the best regular season defender and deserves most of the DPOY&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s received. Night in, night out for 82 games he was the most impactful defensive player and the stats back this up.</p>

<p>Yet in the playoffs he has a clear exploitable weakness that makes him less impactful as guys like AD or Bam.</p>

Gobert was leading the Jazz to top finishes in the West for years and if we want to evaluate those rosters, they completely overachieved in the current landscape of the NBA. Then he goes to the Wolves and they become the best defensive team in the NBA and make the WCF for the first time in 20 years. Then you have everyone under the sun saying Wemby should have won DPOY and that team won 22 games… the same amount of games the Spurs won the prior season without Wemby… it’s almost like oh wait Gobert is actually really fucking good and impacts winning basketball</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s like if you have KD on your Olympics team, you don&rsquo;t play him and Carmelo together, you bench Melo and start KD.</p>

<p>similar thought process for why Gobert got benched/limited minutes. Wemby gives you all the defense Gobert gives you with added passing/decent shooting ability &amp; shot creation</p>

      <label for="lixj0ty" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll just say that Wemby&rsquo;s team winning 22 games is directly correlated to the lack of talent his team had, and not due to his defensive ability.</p>

<p>The issue is that advanced defensive stats are so hard to decipher and understand how much of a player&rsquo;s stats are based on their individual abilities and how much is based on their supporting cast&rsquo;s talent.</p>

<p>From the eye test, Wemby&rsquo;s defensive range and ability was pretty much unmatched in the second half of the season. The way I see it, Gobert was absolutely the most impactful defensive player in the first half of the year. However, Wemby became more of a monster in the second half of the season as evidenced by his reduction in defensive rating from 108 down to 101 after the all-star break.</p>

<p>Wemby had a 10% block rate compared to Gobert&rsquo;s 5.5%.</p>

<p>I will say Robert was probably the better rebounder throughout the entire season as evidenced by his 21.5% TRB% vs Wemby&rsquo;s 19.4%.</p>

<p>Wemby&rsquo;s impact was probably best exhibited by his on/off numbers: his team was -2.8% in TRB%, -7% in BLK%, and -5.8 in defensive rating when Wemby was off the floor. In comparison, Rudy&rsquo;s team was -6.1% in TRB%, dead even in BLK%, and only -2.0 in defensive rating when Gobert was off the court.</p>

<p>All this to say: I think Wemby is the more impactful defender whose defensive numbers and DPOY were greatly affected by the talent around him and who really started to shine after the all star break while Gobert was a great defender throughout the entire season, but was buoyed by a very talented defensive squad around him. The defensive stats do a bad job really teasing out who&rsquo;s better but I really do think that Gobert is the slightly better rebounder while Wemby is just the better overall individual defender.</p>

      <label for="lixjipj" class="commentText"><p>I feel like you haven&rsquo;t looked at the splits of goberts on/off and wembys on/off to say this, as well as seen too many games from either team. The defensive difference between Wemby and his backup is likely the largest gap in the league in terms of skill on a team (defensively). I understand team standing plays a part in individual awards, but it&rsquo;s kinda dumb to talk like gobert has the same on his plate defensively as Wemby, especially when their backups are Naz Reid and fuckin Zach Collins, respectively</p>

<p>Mitchell ( all star ), bogdan ( good starter especially in that period ), Conley ( wasn’t there always but was big for them when he was achieving top seeds), Royce o Neal ( very good 3nD player that nets actually paid a FRP for when he slightly declined for there kd kyrie title contender ), and then gobert . Add in guys like Clarkson as a great spark plug off the bench , they had legit talented top 6-8 players . They’re weakness was there too guys weren’t mvp lbl guys. The roster was terrifically built and had 5 players of good starter to all star lvl quality .</p>

<p>Conley, Mitchell , Royce , bogdan, gobert as your 1-5 is a really solid / great 1-5. Especially in that time it’s amongst the best . I never get giving gobert all this extra praise , Conley Mitchell Royce are hardly cones on there next teams despite them aging .  Gobert himsekf had zero impact on playoffs. Even in Olympus French tesm benched him even when Wemby was off doing better without him. His dogshit offence is such a liability too</p>

<p>And that kind of summarizes the issue with defensive metrics - there are no good ones.  Evaluating defense requires way too much context that can&rsquo;t be summed up neatly into stats.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s obviously a tremendous rim protector, but overall he&rsquo;s definitely overrated.  He&rsquo;s never passed the eye test for me over more flexible guys like Bam and AD.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure he truly has deserved the 4x DPOY&rsquo;s - just voters tend to not look much deeper than rim protection on a big man and then narrative/momentum carries guys in voting for many years.</p>

<p>Big men are especially vulnerable on the switch at the perimeter. It&rsquo;s not unique to Gobert. People just need to get in their head that DPOY is a regular season award, not a playoff award. Maybe they should break out a DPOY-playoffs to make that distinction or something.</p>

      <label for="lixh7ln" class="commentText"><p>The stats aren&rsquo;t meaningless. His on/off section on bbref is green across the board, and that certainly isn&rsquo;t coming from his offensive game. Beyond the raw stats, he was 1st in defensive DARKO every year from 2017 to 2022. The on/off rim protection indicators are fantastic, and the tracking data rim protection indicators are fantastic. The eye test favors Bam, and I agree he&rsquo;s also elite, but his regular season statistical impact doesn&rsquo;t come close. The playoff #s get a lot closer, but Gobert&rsquo;s are still good.</p>

<p>Billups&rsquo;s argument is unfair to Rudy because we do not hold the Mutombos &amp; Alonzo Mournings of yesteryear to the same standard because pnr switch hunting wasn&rsquo;t a thing back then. Thinking Basketball manually tracked some of the Suns/Spurs playoff games, and iirc in one of those series the Suns had like a 160 ortg or something stupid on plays where Nash brought Duncan out in the pnr. They actively targeted that. Duncan is still one of the best defenders of all time, and whether or not he&rsquo;s going to hold up switched onto a guard doesn&rsquo;t change that.</p>

<p>In 2023 you could also clearly see their defensive ceiling near the end of the season (didn&rsquo;t they have the best defence post trade deadline) once Russ was gone and AD got healthy, especially in the playoffs where the Lakers defense was exceptional.</p>

      <label for="lixbb8g" class="commentText"><p>At least not the stats we&rsquo;re seeing publicly. With the aid of tracking cameras, there are absolutely defensive metrics that can be properly contextualized to give us accurate enough outputs to judge the best defensive players, at least for the purpose of awards&hellip; and I&rsquo;d suspect with enough fine tuning, adequate for the purposes of contract discussions.</p>

<p>For example - you could use item response theory models developed for partial credit situations. Isolate defensive acts, apply credit based on relative proximity and velocity of the players&hellip; with all the data available I am 100% certain a computer could be trained to assign the appropriate amount of credit for each player in an on or off ball situation throughout a possession, coming to a final model for portions of each possession. The offensive player would also, across a series or season, develop a difficulty level that plays a role in the score outcome for the possession.</p>

      <label for="lixhf2u" class="commentText"><p>The thing about Rudy is that like many of the best rim protectors in history, he will struggle to guard in open space against the most elite guards in the game. He&rsquo;s flawed in the same way as many of the greats. The reason it feels so weird is that exploiting that flaw is a million times easier in this current era. There are more elite guards these days, 3pt shooting has spaced out the floor so much that it&rsquo;s extremely hard to double, and other rule changes make it impossible to try to guard them 1 on 1. I think if you put someone like Mutombo in the same situations Rudy gets put in now, you&rsquo;ll have similar results. My evaluation of Rudy as a player doesn&rsquo;t change, it&rsquo;s just that that flaw matters more now.</p>

Gobert is obviously a flawed player but his impact on winning basketball is pretty obvious for anybody that has been paying attention. He completely shifted the identity of the Timberwolves and everyone conveniently leaves out his defensive impact on the rest of the roster and getting guys to buy in on that end of the floor. Wolves had one of the best defensive teams of the last 10-15 years last season&hellip; but yeah he&rsquo;s overrated</p>

With the blessing of Billups’ wife, Piper, the trio of Lue, Jones and Carter moved into their home. There was daily film study. Discussions on philosophies and strategy. And on the basketball court in Billups’ backyard, plays were put to life.&rdquo;</p>

It was the turnstile on ball defending that constantly left Gobert in lose-lose situations where he needed to defend the paint and the corner 3.</p>

      <label for="lix9nfp" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve watched every Wolves game for years. The defensive difference for this team pre-Gobert and post-Gobert is absolutely insane. I could make a 2 hour highlight video of guys attacking the basket only to dribble right back out to the perimeter or take a terrible shot. The Wolves had one of the best defenses this league has seen over the past 10-15 years and that isn&rsquo;t hyperbole. They just ran out of gas vs Dallas and why should Gobert be scrutinized for Luka Doncic (one of the most potent offensive players this league has ever seen) drilling a crazy 3 pointer in the last few seconds of the game?? Sometimes that shit just happens.</p>

      <label for="lix9toh" class="commentText"><p>I think people are piling on Rudy because of Luka&rsquo;s 3pt shot at the buzzer. One shot, one time getting dunked on, etc. don&rsquo;t mean that his dominance through the entire season has no value. Rudy has led two franchises to #1 overall defense ratings and high seeds in the West. That&rsquo;s no fluke.</p>

<p>Rudy&rsquo;s rim protection during the Nuggets series was amazing. Rudy was still getting dominated 1-on-1 by Jokic. Both things can be true. Wolves put KAT, a notably worse defender, on Jokic and won the series because Rudy could do what he does best and shut down the paint. Scheme and personnel won that series. Scheme also lost the Mavs series, the Wolves defense was getting torched by Ky and Luka, who could beat man coverage all day but would pass to open dunkers if the big doubled. Does that mean Rudy was a bad defender, or the coaches got outcoached? Maybe both?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because basketball is all about matchups. If the Thunder had beat the Mavs, the Wolves dominate and get to the finals (where they matched up better with than the Celtics than the Mavs did). If the Wolves played the Pelicans or Mavs in the first round, they could have easily lost because the Pels/Mavs have personnel that the Wolves have trouble countering.</p>

<p>What 7 footer is great at defending the perimeter? He&rsquo;s a rim protector and that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s good at. Just because he&rsquo;s dpoy doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s the best at everything.</p>

<p>His inability to be an offensive threat meant that Gafford/Lively were always waiting for any Wolves player in the paint. So PJ Washington could press up against KAT because he knew help was waiting if KAT got by him.</p>

<p>Also KAT’s shot just went ice cold.</p>

      <label for="lixc4dn" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s basically the same thing as the midrange game. For 82 games it is best to avoid the midrange because 3s and layups are more efficient. But in the playoffs when defenses get tighter, teams that can score in the midrange, which gets left open, end up being very successful. So while an elite rim defender is great most of the time, if he can&rsquo;t handle being pushed outside when game plans change then he&rsquo;s going to get exploited.</p>

      <label for="lixayjr" class="commentText"><p>Gobert was the Wolves second best player this year, arguably our best. The Ant love is legitimate, KAT is underrated, but people like to clown Rudy even though he anchored an incredible defense. The Mavs series wasn’t a Gobert exploitation either, the whole roster shit the bed.</p>

<p>Chauncey should give more thought to not beating women and his own dogass team than the legitimate DPOY</p>

      <label for="lixfchg" class="commentText"><p>Rudy Gobert is the best rim protector in the league when he is the helper. Since the NBA is not offensively drive by centers, Rudy is allowed to be a helper most nights in the NBA and be super effective. When NBA teams &ldquo;go&rdquo; at Rudy, they make him guard the ball one on one and in the perimeter. They are effectively warping their offense to get Rudy out of the paint and be a perimeter defender. That&rsquo;s a pretty impactful player if you have to adjust you offense to get away from allowing Rudy to be a rim protector. Anyone that watched Rudy the past years can see the Wolves and the Jazz cannot get consistent stops at the rim or get rebounds without him. He is not even that bad as a center at guarding the perimeter, but in the playoffs he&rsquo;s having to guard the Dames, the Doncics, the cream of the crop of perimeter players who score at will with no help behind him. If he had even a little bit of an offensive game, he would not be able to be played off the court even if the other team targets him every possession because that one on one offense can only be so effective. But since his offensive is horrendous, he can&rsquo;t punish smaller players so the clippers can get by with just playing terrance mann as their center. With that being said, DPOY is DPOY not overall playoff player whose good at defense</p>

      <label for="lixeju2" class="commentText"><p>As a french Timberwolves fan, that follow Gibert through histoire carrier I think there is a big misconception about him.</p>

<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t that he IS a below average permimeter-defender, It&rsquo;s that he is such a Bad offensive player.</p>

<p>When he doesn&rsquo;t have a great playmaker like Mike Conley, He pretty much can&rsquo;t do anything in Offense outside of rebounding and proceed to clock the paint.</p>

<p>So when a team is able to five out, his defensive impact IS greatly reduce and WE are playing 4 on 5 on offense which make him hard top play for long stretch of Time.</p>

<p>Funnily enough everyone compare his defensive game with AD and Bam but truthfully if he had like <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of their offensive game WE wouldn&rsquo;t have this conversation about him being overatted because even if he had Bad Games he would give <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> points with good effencies in important game.</p>

<p>It was the same thing with France, WE pretty much were without PG so nobody could give him simple balls ans hé was bothering Wemby in the paint.</p>

<p>He is phenomenal rim-protector (indeniably one of the best off all Time) and rebounder while being an average perimeter Defender, but he Can be a putride offensive player (and I feel like that so many plemayers raise in the &ldquo;Baller mentality&rdquo; disapprouve of him).</p>

      <label for="lixlc4p" class="commentText"><p>Its the 80s and 90s mentality. Defense is played man to man. You don&rsquo;t switch. Therefore the best defensive player is the guy who plays the best man to man defense. And that&rsquo;s the guy you don&rsquo;t attack.</p>

<p>The problem is we dont play in the 80s and 90s anymore. Attacking Gobert in the drop is the best choice not because its the best possible choice, but all the other choices they make available have you attacking another guy with Gobert helping. So might as well go after Gobert. Gobert covers other weaknesses so going at him 1v1 is now the weakest point&hellip; which honestly is a really good defensive baseline to work from.</p>

<p>The NBA is a wildly different game then it was 20 years ago, but Im not sure a lot of old head thinkers have caught on.</p>
