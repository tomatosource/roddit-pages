Heâ€™s actually 10th all time in total points scored and is the only other player in the top 20 to have never made First Team All NBA along with Paul Pierce.Â  I feel like advanced stats didnâ€™t really favor him and he was never a great defender, but he was an absolute bucket</p>

      <label for="lgl3y6c" class="commentText"><p>Melo and Kyrie get propped up highly because of their skillset and aesthetics, but they donâ€™t offer enough on other aspects of the game besides scoring to be the No. 1 option on a contender (see Kyrie in Boston).</p>

<p>Difference is Kyrie is ok with being No. 2 or 3 and that got him a chip + efficiency behind KD, Harden and Luka, while Melo ego doesnâ€™t want him to.</p>

<p>I call them â€˜glorified AllStarsâ€™ or AllStar impact players being marketed like a superstar because of the aesthetics of their game.</p>

      <label for="lgl592r" class="commentText"><p>Weird take.  Carmelo was injured half his time in New York, had a god awful coach in Denver from what all the players seem to say.  Melo could have found a ton of success under different circumstances.  He&rsquo;s one of the best scorers to ever play the game.  Kyrie was cooking in Boston when healthy. Celtics just hate him because he left. Not to mention he was part of the dynamic duo to defeat one of the statistically greatest teams every assembled in that finals run.  These two only look like pedestrians when literally compared to some of the greatest players of all time.</p>

      <label for="lgkt9sz" class="commentText"><p>Interesting enough for me to dig the stats, played in 4 different USA teams for Olympics,  2012, 2016, 2021, 2024</p>

<p>2012, 8 games avg 19.5</p>

<p>2016, 8 games avg 19.4</p>

<p>2021, 6 games avg 20.7</p>

<p>2024, 3 games played so far avg 16</p>

<p>Itâ€™s going to be hard to overthrow KD. To do so, you need to be the main player, the primary scorer on a stacked team like the USA team from the start. You must also maintain a top-level NBA career and avoid injuries to be selected for the USA team and participate in at least four Olympics, spanning 16 years of your life.</p>

<p>If future USA players canâ€™t achieve it, perhaps the best chance to overthrow KDâ€™s record could come from outside the USA team. The catch is that the outsider must be the primary scorer on their team, and that team must have a strong chance of reaching (at least) the finals in every Olympic Games.</p>

      <label for="lgkzfaf" class="commentText"><p>Really admire KD&rsquo;s dedication to team USA in Olympics. He&rsquo;s achieved everything in international basketball along with being Fiba World Cup MVP once. In a country full of stacked basketball talents, nobody has really done more and probably has never will.</p>

      <label for="lgkt42x" class="commentText"><p>It seems completely unfair to compare pre-1992 players with those who played in 1992 and after, considering that the earlier players only had one opportunity to play in the Olympics (with the exception of David Robinson and Michael Jordan, I believe).</p>
