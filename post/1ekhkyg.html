      <label for="lgkptp7" class="commentText"><p>Melo’s career is really interesting. He’s actually 10th all time in total points scored and is the only other player in the top 20 to have never made First Team All NBA along with Paul Pierce.  I feel like advanced stats didn’t really favor him and he was never a great defender, but he was an absolute bucket</p>

      <label for="lgl3y6c" class="commentText"><p>Melo and Kyrie get propped up highly because of their skillset and aesthetics, but they don’t offer enough on other aspects of the game besides scoring to be the No. 1 option on a contender (see Kyrie in Boston).</p>

<p>Difference is Kyrie is ok with being No. 2 or 3 and that got him a chip + efficiency behind KD, Harden and Luka, while Melo ego doesn’t want him to.</p>

<p>I call them ‘glorified AllStars’ or AllStar impact players being marketed like a superstar because of the aesthetics of their game.</p>

      <label for="lglggsb" class="commentText"><p>Nah I don’t think melo n kyrie are similar.</p>

<p>Kyrie is a better Defender relative to position - he’s been downright decent to good defender at times after his early struggles on D in Cleveland, and kyrie is a much better playmaker n passer- which once again he wasn’t that great at in Cleveland the non Lebron minutes were awful . But he’s led good offences after . So maybe cavs kyrie but after that kyrie is a better defender n passer.</p>

<p>Kyrie definitely has had top 10-15 impact in many seasons which is only just below superstar ranking but considering his playoff highlights n skillset not hard to see why he’s a superstar to many</p>

<p>He would have accepted a secondary role as long as he was starting.</p>

<p>Melo wasn’t as lucky as Kyrie was when Durant left to join a team with good young talent like the Nets. His closest chance was the Heat and we all know how that ended up</p>

      <label for="lgl592r" class="commentText"><p>Weird take.  Carmelo was injured half his time in New York, had a god awful coach in Denver from what all the players seem to say.  Melo could have found a ton of success under different circumstances.  He&rsquo;s one of the best scorers to ever play the game.  Kyrie was cooking in Boston when healthy. Celtics just hate him because he left. Not to mention he was part of the dynamic duo to defeat one of the statistically greatest teams every assembled in that finals run.  These two only look like pedestrians when literally compared to some of the greatest players of all time.</p>

<p>So out of like 15 years of starting he had 6 years where he wasn’t below league average efficiency.</p>

<p>His “scoring” ability pretty much exclusively comes from him shooting the ball more than he should to pad counting stats. I have no clue why he’s mentioned in the same breath as kyrie who’s a dipshit but can still give you 27 a game on 50/40/90 playing in any situation.</p>

<p>When you win less than every other major great with a comparable career, it means something.</p>

<p>Like his numbers are worse than most of the people he&rsquo;s compared to, his advanced stats are worse, and his actual impact on winning wasn&rsquo;t there either.</p>

      <label for="lgkt9sz" class="commentText"><p>Interesting enough for me to dig the stats, played in 4 different USA teams for Olympics,  2012, 2016, 2021, 2024</p>

<p>2012, 8 games avg 19.5</p>

<p>2016, 8 games avg 19.4</p>

<p>2021, 6 games avg 20.7</p>

<p>2024, 3 games played so far avg 16</p>

<p>It’s going to be hard to overthrow KD. To do so, you need to be the main player, the primary scorer on a stacked team like the USA team from the start. You must also maintain a top-level NBA career and avoid injuries to be selected for the USA team and participate in at least four Olympics, spanning 16 years of your life.</p>

<p>If future USA players can’t achieve it, perhaps the best chance to overthrow KD’s record could come from outside the USA team. The catch is that the outsider must be the primary scorer on their team, and that team must have a strong chance of reaching (at least) the finals in every Olympic Games.</p>

      <label for="lgkt42x" class="commentText"><p>It seems completely unfair to compare pre-1992 players with those who played in 1992 and after, considering that the earlier players only had one opportunity to play in the Olympics (with the exception of David Robinson and Michael Jordan, I believe).</p>

      <label for="lgoxays" class="commentText"><p>Melo was at his best as the third scoring option as primarily a spot up shooter on three loaded Olympic teams. The pressure was never on him w Kobe/LBJ/Wade/Durant as options one and two depending on the year. He was a perfect complementary player in this role…much better fit than he was as “the man” in Denver/New York.</p>
