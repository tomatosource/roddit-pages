He took me onto the field during warmups, and obviously I was decked out in Red Sox stuff. None of the Mariners seemed to care that their coach was walking around the field with a 7 year old Red Sox fan, except for one. Ichiro Suzuki. It was business as usual for everyone except him, since he stopped what he was doing and just stared menacingly at us for like 3 minutes. I still remember it vividly 16 years later, and it&rsquo;s basically on sight if I ever run into him again.</p>

The whole thing in Boston about the hierarchy is more likely the result of an indecisive voice from the coaching staff/front office. This is further reinforced by the fact that he went out of his way to disrespect the organization but there&rsquo;s been nothing but praise between the players since. Hell, Brown was Kyrie&rsquo;s biggest supporter during the anti-vax saga.</p>

      <label for="l6qkpft" class="commentText"><p>That was just a poorly constructed team.  The epitome of &ldquo;Too May Mouths&rdquo; syndrome.  They had like 10 starter-level NBA players on the team (only 1 star) and too many guys gunning for personal agendas.  Obviously that first year Hayward was out and Kyrie missed the whole playoffs so 19 year old Tatum lead the charge with Brown/Rozier alongside him for a deep absolutely flukey playoff run taking Bron to 7 games in the ECF, but the following year you had a hobbled Hayward coming back and pissed about his lack of role, you had Brown playing like absolute shit for the first couple months, getting benched and being pissed about his role, you had Terry Rozier getting spot minutes off the bench and being pissed about his role and actively campaigning to be traded.  For most of that regular season you had Hayward and Brown both coming off the bench for Marcus Morris.  You had Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart both ripping into Jaylen Brown every time the young fella made a mistake.  Morris literally shoving and cussing out Brown on camera.  Come playoff time, Brown regained his starting slot, but the chemistry damage was already done and Kyrie shot like total shit.</p>

<p>It was a 49 win team.  Kyrie was great, but his 2nd best player was a 20 year old Tatum who wasn&rsquo;t yet willing to step on anyone&rsquo;s toes (15.7ppg on 13fga).  Neither Brown nor Hayward was playing at a high level.  Horford was Horford.  Smart was Smart.  It wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>Kyrie had become a scapegoat for everything wrong with the team despite being 2nd Team All-NBA that season and his free agency had become a massive distraction.  The media and fans absolutely turned on him mid way through that season.  He had started it saying, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll have me back, I plan on re-signing&rdquo; but by the end it was clear most fans didn&rsquo;t want to have him back. He contributed a bit to the mess, but it wasn&rsquo;t really fair to blame him for all of it and everything I&rsquo;ve read from the players on team like Brown, Rozier, Smart and Tatum, suggest they all had a lot of respect for Kyrie and didn&rsquo;t have any bad blood with him.</p>

<p>You are like the history man from Mad Max, chronicling a time long forgotten and blamed on one guy in Kyrie Irving. Everything you said in this post was %100. Kyrie had his faults in Celtics for sure, but teammates were literally fighting on the sidelines and nobody was doing anything.. Shit was actually a mess of a team in its construction.</p>

<p>I still remember fondly the good games. Some of the best basketball played in the NBA that year was happening in the clutch in TD Garden.</p>

      <label for="l6qocv2" class="commentText"><p>The difference a year later was that 3rd year Tatum finally stepped into his star role (up to 23.4ppg on 18.6 fga), Brown took a monumental leap in his ball handling and overall awareness (going from bench player to 20ppg scorer), Hayward was actually kinda good again (17.5ppg on 50%/38%/85% shooting), and they had replaced Kyrie with Kemba who was like 70% the player with 0% of the drama.   So Boston was back in the ECF and probably would have made the finals had Hayward not been injured in the playoffs again.</p>

<p>But Kyrie wasn&rsquo;t the only guy missing from that team.  Al Horford was too.  Back when Kyrie was getting scapegoated for everything wrong the year prior, you&rsquo;d see fans say things like &ldquo;well if Kyrie was a better leader, he&rsquo;d be preventing Morris from shoving Brown and the chemistry wouldn&rsquo;t have sucked&rdquo;, but my half-serious rebuttal was, &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t some of that responsibility been Horfords as the veteran leader?&rdquo; Once Boston was back in the ECF, I tried to be ironic by suggesting it was because Horford had been holding the team back and jokingly referring to him as Al &ldquo;Holdingusbackford&rdquo;.  Obviously, I love Al and obviously, I still root hard against Kyrie, but my overall point was it was all a complicated time that went beyond just one guy.</p>

      <label for="l6shho5" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll blast through the next two seasons, because they are pretty relevant to upcoming one.</p>

<p>Despite the promising ECF run, the 2020-21 Celtic season was another disaster.  Covid, injuries, and post-bubble burnout.   Hayward had left.  Tatum missed 18 games (a rarity for him), Brown missed 24 games, Smart missed 34 games, and Kemba, now a complete shadow of his former self and on his way out of the league, missed 39 games.</p>

<p>The team finished a measly .500.</p>

<p>Come playoff time, Jaylen Brown was out with an injury, the team was starting Evan Fournier, Kemba&rsquo;s ghost, Romeo Langford and Tristan Thompson.   Tatum did his best in the playoffs (30.6 points, 5.8 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 1.6 blocks, 1.2 steals), but the team was matching up against the greatest team ever assembled&hellip; sort of&hellip; The insane Brooklyn trio of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden played a total of 16 games together and that 5 game series against Boston is literally the only playoff games they ever shared the court with one another.  It went about as well as you&rsquo;d expect.  Brooklyn&rsquo;s super team dominated the Celtics.  Durant averaging 32.6 points, Harden averaging 27.8 points and Kyrie averging 24.8 points.  Kyrie seemingly had his revenge.  An hobbled Brooklyn (Kyrie/Harden trading injury places) managed to take the eventual champion Bucks to 7 games and presumably would have won the title easily had they all stayed healthy together.</p>

<p><strong>2021-22</strong></p>

<p>The aftermath of that season was significant.  During the playoffs Kyrie has made comments accusing Boston of being racist.  Boston&rsquo;s beloved long-time President, Danny Ainge, followed it up with some extremely tone deaf remarks essentially saying he had never witnessed racism.</p>

<p>This is a touchy subject.  In a lot of ways, Boston gets unfairly criticized.  On one hand, it&rsquo;s always been the most progressive team and at the forefront of social change (drafting first black player, first all black starting 5, first black superstar, first black coach, etc) and what Bill Russell faced in the 50s-60s wasn&rsquo;t a uniquely Boston issue.  He certainly would have faced the same trouble had he been playing in Los Angeles, for instance.  On the other hand, players like Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown have shared more recent anecdotes of encountering racism.  For Ainge to come out with those tone deaf comments (as well as some problematic former comments surfaced on social media about not valuing the political opinions of players)  had to have upset activist players like JB and certainly put ownership in a situation where they had to put their money where their mouth was with their declarations of doing what they could during BLM.   Ainge &ldquo;stepped down&rdquo; to &ldquo;retire&rdquo;, but seems to me it wasn&rsquo;t fully voluntary (further proven by how quickly the Mormon Bishop took a job in Utah).</p>

<p>Coach Brad Stevens was promoted to president and the team went out of it&rsquo;s way to hire a black coach - settling on the promising Ime Udoka.   Stevens was able to swap out Kemba&rsquo;s ghost for a returning Al Horford.  An insane 28 different players suited up for the Celtics, who hovered around .500 for the first half the season, but mid-year they had brought in guys like Derrick White and settled on a 9 man rotation.  Udoka, who was busy fucking his subordinate, a married Mormon woman Ainge had previously hired, received a lot of the credit for the turnaround, but the reality of the sudden dominance was the result of some key reasons that had nothing to do with the coach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jayson Tatum, now 23, had evolved into a true 1st Team All-NBA superstar.  23 is the typical age this happens and a natural part of his growth.</li>
<li>Robert Williams had evolved into a DPOY candidate.  Just an absolute defensive menace the likes of which Boston hadn&rsquo;t seen since Kevin Garnett.  He was the key reason Boston&rsquo;s defense was suddenly dominant.</li>
<li>Swapping Kemba for Al Horford was a MAJOR upgrade</li>
<li>The 28 suited-up Celtics (which featured cameos from randos like 40 year old Joe Johnson) had locked into a solid 9 man rotation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boston looked to be championship favorites, but the fragile Robert Williams got injured and never returned to full strength.  In round 1, they managed to get their revenge against Kyrie sweeping him and Durant and effectively sending the Nets into a rebuild.   In round 2, they knocked off the defending champion Bucks.  In round 3, they knocked off the 1st seed Jimmy Butler Heat.   Unfortunately, injuries, exhaustion and lack of experience caught up to them in the Finals where the fell to the dynasty Steph Curry Warriors.</p>

<p>&hellip; Last season was more of the same for Boston.  The Celtics once against decided to be on the right side of history when it came to social change, and fired Udoka for abusing his position of power.  Joe Mazzulla stepped up and the team really didn&rsquo;t miss a beat, but Injuries plagued them in the playoffs.  Tatum already had a shoulder issue, but then busted in ankle in Game 7 resulting in the Heat upsetting them in the ECF.</p>

<p>&hellip; This season, despite missing Porzingis for the first three rounds, Boston coasted through a hobbled Eastern Conference and either will get their Final revenge against Kyrie in the Championship round, or Kyrie will come out victorious and the narrative will be about capping off his own story.</p>

These were interesting years for long term celtics fans. You just know there would be a lot of bumps on the way up but we always have and had competent guys at helm so there was always the confidence that team would go the right direction.

<p>I mean the dude quit in December,  lied to the FO so he won&rsquo;t get traded and quit again in the playoffs. Players can hold to their politics,  fans don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>There was legitimate beef, not &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fight you&rdquo; beef but they clearly didnt like one another.</p>

<p>They both directly took shots at one another in the media after the trade. Kyrie said he didnt want anyone who was &ldquo;not all the way there&rdquo; in terms of joining the team and Harden constantly complained about people &ldquo;not playing&rdquo; in Brooklyn and said he was justified in bailing after the whole thing fell apart with KD and Kyrie leaving as well.</p>

<p>Then you had the stuff like when they played against one another and both KD/Kyrie basically called him lazy and said he (they) &ldquo;didnt want to run&rdquo;.</p>

<p>People act like Kyrie was just some super nice dude everyone loved but he was annoying as fuck to a lot of players and very few of them felt/feel like they are in a spot to take shots at a star like him.</p>

<p>idk why Boston fans try to project their own hatred of Kyrie onto players so much. its like when yall thought Jaylen Brown is a very high IQ intellectual who speaks at Harvard so he must hate Kyrie too. then it turns out Jaylen supports all the same things as Kyrie and was an anti-vaxxer himself</p>

      <label for="l6rq9d8" class="commentText"><p>Are you misinformed?</p>

<p>You realize the city put out the mandate that would make him miss home games, and then Joe Tsai banned him from playing in <em>any</em> games for the nets until he got a vaccination?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tsai said he has not spoken to Irving since the team&rsquo;s collaborative decision on Oct. 12 to not have him be with the team until he complies with New York City&rsquo;s COVID-19 mandate of getting at least one vaccination shot in order to play at Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last time [I] talked to him was when we made the decision that he was not going to be playing until something changes,&rdquo; said Tsai, who owns the team with his wife, Clara Wu Tsai. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t communicated since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Added Tsai: &ldquo;Obviously Kyrie has his own belief so I respect that. But we have to make a team decision. This is not a decision about him. This is a decision about where we go as a team. And it is just not tenable for us to have a team with a player that comes in and out, no home games, only away games. What do you do in practice then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tsai wasn&rsquo;t happy that he was missing home games so he decided to try and put pressure on Kyrie by banning him from away games as well, which Harden was upset about. Yes, Joe Tsai made it worse and refused to let him play. He was very candid about this at the time.</p>

      <label for="l6q9jg9" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s a tough call tbh.</p>

<p>After Horford left in FA he was asked if he would have stayed if he knew earlier we were signing Kemba Walker, he said yes. He was then asked if he would have stayed if he knew Kyrie was staying in Boston, he said no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. ‚ÄúI just think that if Kyrie would have stayed, I don‚Äôt know if it would have worked. There would have had to be some major changes as far as players, because it was just clear that the group that we had just wasn‚Äôt going to be able to coexist.‚Äù</p>

<p>And what about if he‚Äôd known Kemba Walker was coming. Horford paused.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get caught up in the past,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut, yeah, that would have been totally different.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rozier had a similar sentiment in one of his interviews. Although I interpreted Rozier&rsquo;s quote to be more around opportunities. I don&rsquo;t think he would have played next to Kemba (if possible) for example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Terry Rozier said Tuesday on ESPN First Take that he wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in returning to the Boston Celtics if the team decides to bring back the same cast next season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I might have to go. I might have to go. I put up with a lot this year so I said what I said after this season. I think we all know I&rsquo;m not trying to step into that again,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>For someone who‚Äôs batting hard for Kyrie in every comment you make, why is it so hard for you not to do your research about something HE‚ÄôS INVOLVED IN.</p>

<p>the same NY mayor that immediately repealed the mandate once Yankees season started so Judge could play? the same mayor that let anti-vaxx players like Jaylen Brown play in NYC? You lost this one.</p>

The NY mandate allowed Kyrie to practice with the team, but unvaccinated players could not play at HOME games. The unvaccinated player could play at away games, why would a NY mandate affect laws in other states dummy? Kyrie immediately made it clear his available to play at away games, but the Nets decided to make a team decision &amp; not let Kyrie play in away games! The Nets as an organization made shit harder than it had to be. &amp; It‚Äôs a shame people like you &amp; the media never actually held the Nets accountable for their terrible decisions. I see you already gaslighting other people with fake info so here is a link to the truth, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nets-say-kyrie-irving-wont-play-until-hes-a-full-participant-nix-idea-of-exclusively-playing-road-games/amp/" target="_blank">https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nets-say-kyrie-irving-wont-play-until-hes-a-full-participant-nix-idea-of-exclusively-playing-road-games/amp/</a></p>

If you were 18 when Bill retired, you&rsquo;d be 73 now. I don&rsquo;t hear anyone calling Nets fans racist for what Jackie Robinson experienced. Jim Crow Laws were still a thing in the South at the very end of Bill&rsquo;s career, and I don&rsquo;t hear anyone calling the fans of the teams in those areas racist. It was a very different time, and it&rsquo;s unfair to characterize Boston as the same place it was back then when its population is almost entirely different.</p>

      <label for="l6qp8fo" class="commentText"><p>Massachusetts has this pretentious condescending racism. It‚Äôs a lot more uncomfortable if you‚Äôre not white. I‚Äôve lived in multiple Southern states, and while it‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt heard racist things, it‚Äôs a lot easier to read people, people are just more open. People in Mass act like they‚Äôre better and smarter than everyone, and because it‚Äôs a liberal state, people act like they‚Äôre incapable of being racist, yet they‚Äôll say things with racist undertones. It‚Äôs incredible some of the ignorant words I‚Äôve heard from people up there.</p>

<p>In the South, you know exactly who and what you‚Äôre dealing with. Up North, people are a lot more discreet with their thoughts, and it‚Äôs overall way more uncomfortable to live with.</p>

<p>Yeah, THIS pretty much it.  We all know how great Kyrie is as a basketball player but the way he threw that Bucks series and was so obvious and evident about him being checked out is a fucking travesty.  If he laid it all on the line playing on the court and we still lost, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d get the same kind of vitriol that he&rsquo;s still getting from Boston fans.</p>

<p>Saying he&rsquo;ll stay and re-sign but ultimately changed his mind I thought was fine.  Throwing away playoff games because you&rsquo;re so mentally checked out you couldn&rsquo;t even try on the court and demanding to defend Giannis on the court 1-on-1 as a PG is a fucking outrage.</p>

Hey I&rsquo;m sure the other players had a bunch of great super deep late night philosophical convos with him in that 2019 season while they were all mentally checked out by April though so it&rsquo;s great they&rsquo;re still friends.

<p>But playing the way he did in the Bucks series is him torching the entire ship right before getting on the dinghy to get off.  He wasn&rsquo;t content with just getting off the ship, he had to fuck his teammates, management and the fans before leaving.  <strong>Some teams wait for decades just to get a sniff of the playoffs</strong>, and this pseudo-intellectual motherfucker just decides to throw the series because he&rsquo;s so checked out.</p>

That team was supposed to be Kyrie and Hayward&rsquo;s team - of course Kyrie was supposed to outscore Tatum with him getting majority of the touches with the hollow shell of Hayward coming off the bench and the two Jays still deferring to Kyrie since it was HIS team.  Pointing to his individual stats on those games doesn&rsquo;t tell the story about how he was playing &ldquo;hero ball&rdquo; with poor shot selection and fucking around and waving off help defense because he decided he wanted to guard Giannis one-on-one, lol.</p>

      <label for="l6uxd1i" class="commentText"><p>Celtics were a healthy Kyrie from beating LeBron&rsquo;s 2018 Cavs in the ECF. Even without him they pushed them to seven games on the back of a rookie. Kyrie was top ten in just about every box scored based advanced metric that season, averaging 24ppg on close to 50/49/90 shooting, nearly 10ppg more than the next Celtic. That game 7 was close too, Celtics had the lead with just 6 minutes to go but they lacked a closer. Kyrie is a pretty damn good closer, we all know that. I find it very hard to see that team losing to the Cavs with Kyrie, in fact it would be closer to a sweep than going the full seven.<br>
So talk about a legacy saving injury. Imagine LeBron having that on his resume? The famous 2016 Finals win that he pretty much claims as his own, that his stans pretty much claim was all down to LeBron yet smarter people know Kyrie played a huge part. Without him they don&rsquo;t win and likely get swept. Then Kyrie comes back two seasons later and knocks LeBron out of the playoffs? Damn&hellip;.that would be so much fuel for Jordan fans to use against him I&rsquo;m not sure there would be a GOAT debate at all any more&hellip;</p>
