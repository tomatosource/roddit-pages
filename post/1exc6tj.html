      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1exc6tj/startbenchcutdavid_westcarlos_boozer_and_zach/"><p>Start,Bench,Cut:David West,Carlos Boozer and Zach Randolph</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My Opinion: Here’s a deeper explanation for each choice:</p>

<h3 id="start-zach-randolph"><strong>Start: Zach Randolph</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scoring &amp; Rebounding:</strong> Randolph was one of the most reliable low-post scorers and rebounders. At his peak, he averaged 20+ points and 10+ rebounds per game, making him a key offensive and defensive force.</li>
<li><strong>Toughness &amp; Clutch Performances:</strong> He thrived in physical, grind-it-out games, which made him invaluable in playoff situations. Randolph was capable of dominating matchups in the paint with his strength and skill, even against more athletic opponents.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Winning:</strong> As the centerpiece of the &ldquo;Grit and Grind&rdquo; Grizzlies, Randolph’s contributions were pivotal to Memphis&rsquo; success, including deep playoff runs. His consistency and ability to take over games give him the nod as a starter.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bench-david-west"><strong>Bench: David West</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> West was more versatile than Boozer, particularly on both ends of the floor. His reliable mid-range jumper spaced the floor, and his high basketball IQ made him a key player in both starting and bench roles for his teams.</li>
<li><strong>Defense &amp; Leadership:</strong> While not an elite defender, West was solid and tough, contributing on defense as a physical presence. His leadership was a huge factor during his time with the Pacers, and later, his veteran experience helped the Warriors win championships.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> West&rsquo;s ability to contribute as a scorer, defender, and leader, even in reduced roles, made him an ideal bench player who could also start if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cut-carlos-boozer"><strong>Cut: Carlos Boozer</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Offensive Skills:</strong> Boozer was an excellent offensive player, particularly as a low-post scorer and mid-range shooter. However, his offensive contributions came with some limitations—he was often inconsistent in big moments.</li>
<li><strong>Defensive Weaknesses:</strong> Boozer’s biggest drawback was his defense. He struggled to defend in the post and lacked the lateral quickness to guard more agile forwards, which often became a liability in playoff series.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Impact:</strong> While Boozer had some fantastic seasons, his overall impact was often overshadowed by defensive issues and inconsistency. In comparison to Randolph and West, he contributed less in terms of leadership and defensive versatility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, Randolph&rsquo;s ability to carry a team as a dominant scorer and rebounder, West&rsquo;s versatility and leadership, and Boozer&rsquo;s defensive weaknesses and inconsistency justify the order.</p>

      <label for="lj4wrk6" class="commentText"><p>Randolph as starter, West as reserve, cut Boozer.</p>

<p>Randolph mentality and playstyle as a bruiser and general strongman allowed him to be an enforcer in the post despite a inconsistent and lacking perimeter game. Gutsy leader at PF is a great thing to have.</p>

<p>West had a bit of savvy but was very consistent on both ends. Good bench guy to have.</p>

<p>Boozer had a solid offensive game but his slightly shorter stature led to defensive problems.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not awfully familiar with Boozer&rsquo;s game- I thought he was obviously the best, but that doesn&rsquo;t line up with the statistics. I&rsquo;ll very roughly go Randolph first as a starter, give Boozer a whirl on the bench, and cut West. Much much closer than I originally expected though.</p>
