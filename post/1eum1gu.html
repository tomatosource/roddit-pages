      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eum1gu/in_tim_duncans_16th_season_he_averaged_178_ppg_10/"><p>In Tim Duncan&rsquo;s 16th season, he averaged 17.8 ppg, 10 rpg, and 2.7 bpg, while also being named an All-star, All-NBA 1st team, and All-Defensive 2nd team. He was 37!</p>

      <p>I just wanted to highlight Tim Duncan&rsquo;s insane longevity. Not only did he receive various season awards during the <sup>2012</sup>&frasl;<sub>2013</sub> season, he also anchored the Spurs to a top 3 defense, a 58-24 record (2nd in the west) and a trip to the NBA finals. He was 36 and 37 years old during the season and still played 69 games and averaged 30.1 mpg.</p>

<p>He was also incredible in the playoffs, averaging 18.1 ppg and 10.2 rpg in 21 games. Not to shabby for the Big Fundamental!</p>

<p>His <sup>2012</sup>&frasl;<sub>2013</sub> season is one of the most underrated seasons for a player, in my opinion.</p>

      <label for="lil8g0w" class="commentText"><p>I think you can make a legit case that Duncan was a top 25 player in the world for 20 straight years, from his junior year at Wake Forest to his 18th year in the NBA. He only dropped out of the top 25 his very last NBA season. </p>

<p>I think only LeBron and Kareem can make that same claim in terms of longevity. </p>

      <label for="lilerpf" class="commentText"><p>Wow that’s something I didn’t know before. Just looked that up was surprised he had that drop. I think his 2010 and 2012 years were still good (All NBA or All Defense) that his down 2011 year doesn’t drop him out completely of the top 25 for the long run moving average. For that particular year, I agree that he might not have been top 25 though in terms of pure production. Something new I learned. </p>

Instead of just kind of shrugging his shoulders and accepting his fate so to speak. He famously completely redid his off-season workouts and started doing boxing And some other less basketball related physical activity that he gave major props to him making a huge comeback The last few seasons</p>

They also invented load management and got very publicly fined for it. No way that team suddenly changed its philosophy for its new franchise player</p>

      <label for="lilbhx2" class="commentText"><p>I remember in the mid-2000&rsquo;s, a study came out about player efficiency as a function of age.  Basically it improves rapidly until 26-27, continues to improve moderately until 30-31, plateaus until 32-34, and then falls off a cliff after that.  A few years after that, when looking into the Spurs&rsquo; load management situation, someone quantified players&rsquo; physical loads by coming up with some metric that combined avg minutes per game, avg games per week (or some standardized period of time), and avg length of time to return from injury relative to the rest of the league.  It turned out the Spurs had been matching their players&rsquo; physical loads to the efficiency curve <em>exactly</em>&hellip;for over 1.5 decades <em>before</em> the efficiency curve was discovered and published.</p>

<p>I will die on this hill, they are the best run franchise in sports.  The Kawhi episode completely blew me away.  For someone who was so worried about injuries, and who wanted to compete for championships regularly over a long career&hellip;<em>and who didn&rsquo;t care about the fame or the spotlight</em>&hellip;.I can&rsquo;t imagine a better match.</p>

<p>That said, I will always think it was lame as fuck to insinuate the medical staff weren&rsquo;t thinking about his best interests and were rushing him back.  That group has a better track record than any other team in the league.  He can disagree with them without making media comments about people that have no platform with which to defend themselves, <em>especially</em> people who have consistently put players&rsquo; best interests first for decades.</p>

<p>He and magic johnson are the only 2 players in modern nba history to have been drafted to a playoff team as a first pick.</p>

<p>All others went to a lottery team.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait for wemby to realize he can&rsquo;t win on the spurs, and shit on tim duncan&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought this spurs organization was good, how did you give tim duncan such a good career, and you can&rsquo;t do it for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>holy shit will it shift some narratives around.</p>

<p>wemby didn&rsquo;t even budge the W column as a first pick, even DESPITE being twice of a greater prospect than Tim Duncan was.</p>

<p>Not to mention, he won a bronze medal in the olympics against his own Spurs Teammate.</p>

<p>Really drives it home that Spurs really made Tim Duncan&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>Had Tim Duncan been drafted to the KG Wolves, and KG been drafted to the Tim Duncan Spurs.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d be talking about how KG is the greatest PF of all time.</p>

<p>Fraudulent career. Bronze medal winner.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m ready to move him outside of the top 10.</p>

<p>Also, you clearly don&rsquo;t know much about Tim&rsquo;s 4 years at Wake Forest. He was a guy that everyone knew was a generational talent,  like they knew Peyton Manning was for football. To say the Spurs made Tim Duncan shows how little you actually know about basketball. </p>

<p>It would have to be in a situation where the player is on the undisputed best team in the league and is the DPOY.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, this was before the new All NBA rules but even with the new All NBA rules, I believe he would have made second team. Third team had guys like Brad Beal who put up 30+ PPG and had better pure counting stats.</p>

      <label for="lilk3h3" class="commentText"><p>Tim Duncan was drafted to a playoff team as a first pick.</p>

<p>He and magic johnson are the only 2 players in modern nba history to have been drafted to a playoff team as a first pick.</p>

<p>All others went to a lottery team.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait for wemby to realize he can&rsquo;t win on the spurs, and shit on tim duncan&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought this spurs organization was good, how did you give tim duncan such a good career, and you can&rsquo;t do it for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>holy shit will it shift some narratives around.</p>

<p>wemby didn&rsquo;t even budge the W column as a first pick, even DESPITE being twice of a greater prospect than Tim Duncan was.</p>

<p>Not to mention, he won a bronze medal in the olympics against his own Spurs Teammate.</p>

<p>Really drives it home that Spurs really made Tim Duncan&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>Had Tim Duncan been drafted to the KG Wolves, and KG been drafted to the Tim Duncan Spurs.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d be talking about how KG is the greatest PF of all time.</p>

<p>Fraudulent career. Bronze medal winner.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m ready to move him outside of the top 10.</p>
