      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eum1gu/in_tim_duncans_16th_season_he_averaged_178_ppg_10/"><p>In Tim Duncan&rsquo;s 16th season, he averaged 17.8 ppg, 10 rpg, and 2.7 bpg, while also being named an All-star, All-NBA 1st team, and All-Defensive 2nd team. He was 37!</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I just wanted to highlight Tim Duncan&rsquo;s insane longevity. Not only did he receive various season awards during the <sup>2012</sup>&frasl;<sub>2013</sub> season, he also anchored the Spurs to a top 3 defense, a 58-24 record (2nd in the west) and a trip to the NBA finals. He was 36 and 37 years old during the season and still played 69 games and averaged 30.1 mpg.</p>

<p>He was also incredible in the playoffs, averaging 18.1 ppg and 10.2 rpg in 21 games. Not to shabby for the Big Fundamental!</p>

<p>His <sup>2012</sup>&frasl;<sub>2013</sub> season is one of the most underrated seasons for a player, in my opinion.</p>

      <label for="lil8g0w" class="commentText"><p>I think you can make a legit case that Duncan was a top 25 player in the world for 20 straight years, from his junior year at Wake Forest to his 18th year in the NBA. He only dropped out of the top 25 his very last NBA season. </p>

<p>I think only LeBron and Kareem can make that same claim in terms of longevity. </p>

      <label for="lil6bsk" class="commentText"><p>I believe Chris Paul was 2nd team All NBA with the Suns just a few years ago in 2021 with worse counting stats so it’s not totally impossible but pretty improbable. </p>

<p>It would have to be in a situation where the player is on the undisputed best team in the league and is the DPOY.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, this was before the new All NBA rules but even with the new All NBA rules, I believe he would have made second team. Third team had guys like Brad Beal who put up 30+ PPG and had better pure counting stats.</p>

      <label for="lil96dd" class="commentText"><p>That was the thing that always annoyed me about that situation lol, the Spurs held Duncan out of the 2000 playoffs due to a meniscus injury when he wanted to play through it, effectively ending their chances of a b2b because they wanted to preserve his long term health. They also invented load management and got very publicly fined for it. No way that team suddenly changed its philosophy for its new franchise player</p>

      <label for="lilbhx2" class="commentText"><p>I remember in the mid-2000&rsquo;s, a study came out about player efficiency as a function of age.  Basically it improves rapidly until 26-27, continues to improve moderately until 30-31, plateaus until 32-34, and then falls off a cliff after that.  A few years after that, when looking into the Spurs&rsquo; load management situation, someone quantified players&rsquo; physical loads by coming up with some metric that combined avg minutes per game, avg games per week (or some standardized period of time), and avg length of time to return from injury relative to the rest of the league.  It turned out the Spurs had been matching their players&rsquo; physical loads to the efficiency curve <em>exactly</em>&hellip;for over 1.5 decades <em>before</em> the efficiency curve was discovered and published.</p>

<p>I will die on this hill, they are the best run franchise in sports.  The Kawhi episode completely blew me away.  For someone who was so worried about injuries, and who wanted to compete for championships regularly over a long career&hellip;<em>and who didn&rsquo;t care about the fame or the spotlight</em>&hellip;.I can&rsquo;t imagine a better match.</p>
