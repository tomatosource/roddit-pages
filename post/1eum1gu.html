      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eum1gu/in_tim_duncans_16th_season_he_averaged_178_ppg_10/"><p>In Tim Duncan&rsquo;s 16th season, he averaged 17.8 ppg, 10 rpg, and 2.7 bpg, while also being named an All-star, All-NBA 1st team, and All-Defensive 2nd team. He was 37!</p>

      <p>I just wanted to highlight Tim Duncan&rsquo;s insane longevity. Not only did he receive various season awards during the <sup>2012</sup>&frasl;<sub>2013</sub> season, he also anchored the Spurs to a top 3 defense, a 58-24 record (2nd in the west) and a trip to the NBA finals. He was 36 and 37 years old during the season and still played 69 games and averaged 30.1 mpg.</p>

<p>He was also incredible in the playoffs, averaging 18.1 ppg and 10.2 rpg in 21 games. Not to shabby for the Big Fundamental!</p>

<p>His <sup>2012</sup>&frasl;<sub>2013</sub> season is one of the most underrated seasons for a player, in my opinion.</p>

      <label for="lil8g0w" class="commentText"><p>I think you can make a legit case that Duncan was a top 25 player in the world for 20 straight years, from his junior year at Wake Forest to his 18th year in the NBA. He only dropped out of the top 25 his very last NBA season. </p>

<p>I think only LeBron and Kareem can make that same claim in terms of longevity. </p>

      <label for="lilerpf" class="commentText"><p>Wow that’s something I didn’t know before. Just looked that up was surprised he had that drop. I think his 2010 and 2012 years were still good (All NBA or All Defense) that his down 2011 year doesn’t drop him out completely of the top 25 for the long run moving average. For that particular year, I agree that he might not have been top 25 though in terms of pure production. Something new I learned. </p>

Instead of just kind of shrugging his shoulders and accepting his fate so to speak. He famously completely redid his off-season workouts and started doing boxing And some other less basketball related physical activity that he gave major props to him making a huge comeback The last few seasons</p>

      <label for="lil96dd" class="commentText"><p>That was the thing that always annoyed me about that situation lol, the Spurs held Duncan out of the 2000 playoffs due to a meniscus injury when he wanted to play through it, effectively ending their chances of a b2b because they wanted to preserve his long term health. They also invented load management and got very publicly fined for it. No way that team suddenly changed its philosophy for its new franchise player</p>

      <label for="lilbhx2" class="commentText"><p>I remember in the mid-2000&rsquo;s, a study came out about player efficiency as a function of age.  Basically it improves rapidly until 26-27, continues to improve moderately until 30-31, plateaus until 32-34, and then falls off a cliff after that.  A few years after that, when looking into the Spurs&rsquo; load management situation, someone quantified players&rsquo; physical loads by coming up with some metric that combined avg minutes per game, avg games per week (or some standardized period of time), and avg length of time to return from injury relative to the rest of the league.  It turned out the Spurs had been matching their players&rsquo; physical loads to the efficiency curve <em>exactly</em>&hellip;for over 1.5 decades <em>before</em> the efficiency curve was discovered and published.</p>

<p>I will die on this hill, they are the best run franchise in sports.  The Kawhi episode completely blew me away.  For someone who was so worried about injuries, and who wanted to compete for championships regularly over a long career&hellip;<em>and who didn&rsquo;t care about the fame or the spotlight</em>&hellip;.I can&rsquo;t imagine a better match.</p>

<p>As far as showing the study&hellip;it was two decades ago and I was in high school or college when I read it, I have no idea where it is or how to find it.  I am probably wrong about some of the details.  The thing I remember is that the Spurs were matching the amount they played their players to the curve the study found in terms of net effect per minute, and they had been doing it since way before the study came out.</p>

<p>Id likely respond poorly too, even if the staff was correct (like it seems they were)</p>

<p>He and magic johnson are the only 2 players in modern nba history to have been drafted to a playoff team as a first pick.</p>

<p>All others went to a lottery team.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait for wemby to realize he can&rsquo;t win on the spurs, and shit on tim duncan&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought this spurs organization was good, how did you give tim duncan such a good career, and you can&rsquo;t do it for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>holy shit will it shift some narratives around.</p>

<p>wemby didn&rsquo;t even budge the W column as a first pick, even DESPITE being twice of a greater prospect than Tim Duncan was.</p>

<p>Not to mention, he won a bronze medal in the olympics against his own Spurs Teammate.</p>

<p>Really drives it home that Spurs really made Tim Duncan&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>Had Tim Duncan been drafted to the KG Wolves, and KG been drafted to the Tim Duncan Spurs.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d be talking about how KG is the greatest PF of all time.</p>

<p>Fraudulent career. Bronze medal winner.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m ready to move him outside of the top 10.</p>

<p>Also, you clearly don&rsquo;t know much about Tim&rsquo;s 4 years at Wake Forest. He was a guy that everyone knew was a generational talent,  like they knew Peyton Manning was for football. To say the Spurs made Tim Duncan shows how little you actually know about basketball. </p>

<p>stop shifting narratives</p>

<p>tim duncan was extremely lucky to end up where he ended up, and had many OAT greats had his opportunity, they&rsquo;d have a better legacy too.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Tim Duncan truly ended up on a lottery team, where would he be?</p>

<p>Nowhere near close to where he ranks today.</p>

<p>Spurs was an extremely beneficial team for him.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait for Wemby to blow up when he sees he&rsquo;s not winning.</p>

<p>There will be narratives, i tell you, and i&rsquo;ll be the first to pump the fuck out of that narrative.</p>

<p>Wemby is not a 25 win player</p>

<p>just as Tim ducan isn&rsquo;t a consistent 50 win player</p>

<p>you think there is a 25 win difference between Wemby and Tim Duncan?</p>

<p>fuck out of here.</p>

<p>So go back and look at the 96-97 spurs team and tell me again how that team is close to a playoff team. The next year, they revamped their roster quite significantly, so this idea that Tim just slid into a playoff team is false. They constructed almost a whole new team around him, along with Robinson who just missed a season from injury.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t ignore the fact Tim has 5 championships. Did he land in a good spot, sure. But you act like he was along for the ride when that&rsquo;s not remotely true. </p>

<p>Just admit that you&rsquo;re a hater and that you&rsquo;re making up alternate histories to try and prove something. That&rsquo;s not how arguments work. It&rsquo;s insane that the basis of your defense is that if history was completely different then different stuff would happen.  Duh dude.</p>

<p>Kind of like the 2019 warriors (15 win team)</p>

<p>If you know your history, the team consistently went to the second round, but had an injury year</p>

<p>again, like kind of like the 2019 warriors.</p>

<p>The warriors, on paper, and healthy, was still a 40+ win team, but they needed to manage their injuries.</p>

<p>But! it did land them James Wiseman, the second overall pick.</p>

<p>So no, I&rsquo;m not making up scenarios in my head.</p>

<p>The 97 spurs was still a playoff team without Tim Duncan as they have consistently achieved before their injury year.</p>

<p>A more apt comparison would be the dumpster fire left behind after LeBron went to Miami. A bunch of guys that were sort of built around one great player. That team was hot trash without him, just like the Spurs were without Duncan. Their leading scorer was a 37 year old &lsquo;Nique. Also, Robinson, Del Negro, and Johson were over 31 years old. </p>

<p>The year they drafted Duncan, they also brought back Chuck Persons,  brought in Jaren Jackson and Malik Rose. Either way, downplaying an all-time great is weird, but using that as a narrative to try and destroy a rising star is almost more weird. You&rsquo;re arguing with agenda.</p>

      <label for="lilv2qv" class="commentText"><p>the 03 spurs team was built for defense, and even without tim duncan, was superb in defense, a precursor to the 04 championships.</p>

<p>a style of half court offenses with little up and down the court.</p>

<p>lowest pace in nba history, dead ball era.</p>

<p>really favorable for players like tim duncan and pop to consistently run half court sets, and set defenses.</p>

<p>they were cohesive, extremely in tune with one another.</p>

<p>There was something about the tim duncan spurs that said &ldquo;team basketball&rdquo; that no other team really could say.</p>

<p>but that&rsquo;s just my point.</p>

<p>tim duncan individually isn&rsquo;t that great, like i said, if he had gone to a lottery team we wouldn&rsquo;t be talking about him right now.</p>

<p>The entire spurs organization was awesome, from RC buford to pop, and to the rest of the team.</p>

<p>All of those wins should be attributed a lot more to the organization than to Tim Duncan individually, and honestly IT WAS!</p>

<p>i have no idea when this narrative started that Tim Duncan was solely responsible for 5 of their championships - if there was any player that had to reliquish some of his own glory so that his teammates and organization should be recognized, that mfer is named Tim Duncan.</p>

<p>Poppovich was absolutely notrious for resting his big 3 at the end of the season to prep them for playoffs, in fact, he would regularly sit his starters in favor of his bench to &ldquo;send a message&rdquo;, and still end up winning the game.</p>

<p>Poppovich&rsquo;s record without his big 3 (there&rsquo;s a lot of games of that scenario) is still over .500</p>

<p>You absolutely cannot say Tim Duncan didn&rsquo;t receive any help from his organization.</p>

<p>Other than Magic Johnson, I can&rsquo;t think of any other player that was given a freebie of a career.</p>

<p>Nobody ever said he was solely responsible. You&rsquo;re using extreme scenarios to put words in my mouth. </p>

<p>Last I checked, literally every single player got help from their organization.</p>

<p>Comparing the Spurs to the Lakers is an insane take being as their was more than one iteration of the Spurs that won a championship&hellip;.meaning completely different styles and rosters. Magic played with talent, sure, but he played with mostly the same collection of starters for most of his career. </p>

<p>I can tell you&rsquo;re young because of the references you&rsquo;re using. It&rsquo;s hilarious how you keep telling people who lived and watched basketball during these times to know our history, when you clearly don&rsquo;t really know yours very well.</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s weird how we talk about the teams Duncan landed on, then use an example of a team from 6 years after he&rsquo;s drafted to try and make your point about how he was drafted onto a playoff team. A lot of your points are obviously from someone who wasn&rsquo;t actually alive during those times, and I can tell because someone who lived those times wouldn&rsquo;t be taking stuff out of context like you&rsquo;re unknowingly doing. </p>

<p>Tim Duncan went to a lottery team the same way James Wiseman, the second overall pick, went to the Golden State Warriors, a lottery team.</p>

<p>James Wiseman was so good for the Golden State Warriors, that he turned the lottery team into eventual champions in 2 years.</p>

<p>Fucking Amazing player in James Wiseman.</p>

<p>He keeps this rate up, he can end up with 6 rings by the end of his career.</p>

<p>It would have to be in a situation where the player is on the undisputed best team in the league and is the DPOY.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, this was before the new All NBA rules but even with the new All NBA rules, I believe he would have made second team. Third team had guys like Brad Beal who put up 30+ PPG and had better pure counting stats.</p>

      <label for="limbhwz" class="commentText"><p>Duncan wasn&rsquo;t even in the top 20 in <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2013_advanced.html#advanced_stats::WS" target="_blank">win shares </a>that year. 100% a name recognition pick.</p>

<p>Also I think it&rsquo;s a microcosm of Tim Duncan&rsquo;s career that he can slip by into a 1st All-NBA team by filling the one required Center spot, while simultaneously getting onto the 2nd All-Defensive team by being listed as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_NBA_season#Awards" target="_blank">forward</a> (which he otherwise would have missed because 1st All-Defensive center was Ty Chandler and 2nd was Marc Gasol). Tim Duncan is &ldquo;the greatest power forward ever&rdquo; whenever he&rsquo;s being compared to all-time centers like Shaq or Kareem, or just centers who are better defensively like Gasol or Ben Wallace. But then if you try to evaluate Duncan&rsquo;s offensive output he&rsquo;s no longer a forward like Dirk or Durant, he&rsquo;s back to being a center. So convenient.</p>

<p>He and magic johnson are the only 2 players in modern nba history to have been drafted to a playoff team as a first pick.</p>

<p>All others went to a lottery team.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t wait for wemby to realize he can&rsquo;t win on the spurs, and shit on tim duncan&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought this spurs organization was good, how did you give tim duncan such a good career, and you can&rsquo;t do it for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>holy shit will it shift some narratives around.</p>

<p>wemby didn&rsquo;t even budge the W column as a first pick, even DESPITE being twice of a greater prospect than Tim Duncan was.</p>

<p>Not to mention, he won a bronze medal in the olympics against his own Spurs Teammate.</p>

<p>Really drives it home that Spurs really made Tim Duncan&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>Had Tim Duncan been drafted to the KG Wolves, and KG been drafted to the Tim Duncan Spurs.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d be talking about how KG is the greatest PF of all time.</p>

<p>Fraudulent career. Bronze medal winner.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m ready to move him outside of the top 10.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Had Tim Duncan been drafted to the KG Wolves, and KG been drafted to the Tim Duncan Spurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering KG’s peak was as high, if not higher, as Duncan’s this has always been an interesting thought experiment. But why is this an argument against Duncan? It’s an argument that Minnesota was a horribly run franchise that squandered KG’s prime.</p>
