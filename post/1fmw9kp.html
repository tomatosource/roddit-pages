<blockquote>
<p>“People always ask me, when did you guys know you were going to win a championship?” Tatum said. “When Minnesota beat Denver, I felt like Denver was the only team that they matched up best with us. I thought that we were going to play Denver in the Finals and it was going to be a good one.</p>

<p>But when we were in Dallas and we went up, 3-0, oh my God. Nobody has ever come back from 0-3, so I remember getting back to the locker room and I remember saying, I don’t know what game it’s going to be, but we’re going to win the championship. That was a weird feeling. I wasn’t able to sleep that night and I remember the morning of Game 4 we had shootaround, and I had never been in the position that if we win tonight, we’re champions. We were at shootaround and everybody was trying to act normal. I couldn’t take a nap. We lost by like 30. We wanted to win so bad. We were so anxious and so tight. But I knew when we were coming back home for Game 5, we were going to win.”</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious that the Celtics are a nightmare matchup for the Mavs similar to how Denver was a nightmare matchup for the Heat in 2023</p>

<p>Somehow analysts decided to unironically pick on &ldquo;vibes&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team is also filled with somewhat boring personalities which is great as a fan of the team but won’t attract the attention of the casual fan.</p>

Now that we know the outcome, those same analysts are saying that the Mavs having a harder road means they were more banged up and likely to lose vs the Celtics.</p>

      <label for="lodplgl" class="commentText"><p>that talking point in the leadup was so confusing. I kept pointing back at the 2022 Celtics, we also went through a gauntlet in the East to get to the Finals. guess what happened when we got there? we had zero gas left and basically got ran off the floor the last two games.</p>

<p>having a tougher road to the Finals is a <em>bad</em> thing. playing a lower number of games against lesser competition conserves stamina and ultimately gives you a better chance of winning the championship, and that’s why playoff seeding is designed to give the best performing regular season teams the most advantageous matchups</p>

<p>The spurs and Lakers won 10 titles combined in the span of 20 years.</p>

<p>They definitely had the toughest road to the finals every year in the west and I feel like that gauntlet is what made them destroy the eastern conference so much.</p>

<p>It’s like sharpening your sword with steel (western conference teams) vs sharpening your sword with aluminum (Eastern conference teams)</p>

<p>I’m talking of the East back in the 2000s, when they had 2 or 3 teams make the playoffs with sub .500 records.</p>

Now boston from 08-10 was a battle because they were equal. However if boston was beating up on the east with little resistance they are 3 peating because of the battles lal and sas went thru to get to the finals. Facing an equal team in the finals if one went thru hell and the other is resting doesn&rsquo;t help the fatigued team at all</p>

      <label for="lodyl3n" class="commentText"><p>What they really need to do is have the #1 and #2 seeds face off in the first round, then have the winner face the other conference&rsquo;s #1 seed in the Conference Semis, followed by the All-Time Lakers roster in the Conference Finals, then when you inevitably beat the 8 seed left standing in the NBA Finals we can all say we&rsquo;re obviously not moved because you beat a play-in team for the championship</p>

      <label for="lodsj20" class="commentText"><p>Also acting like the Celtics weren&rsquo;t battle tested was so dumb. Tatum, Brown, and Horford had been to 5 ECFs together and Jrue is also a champion. Acting like they weren&rsquo;t gonna be ready for the Finals is genuinely delusional.</p>

<p>If the team you’re favoring has a week off before the finals, they’ll be “well rested”. If the team you aren’t has a week off, they’ll be “rusty”</p>

They were talking so much bull shit and whining so much they got others to start to smell it and nod their heads agreeing that&rsquo;s what we need to highlight. </p>

They had by far the best season of any team, they steamrolled through the east in the playoffs, there was no sexy narrative to push there other than &ldquo;the Celtics were simply a much better constructed team than everyone else.&rdquo; Couldn&rsquo;t even crown someone as the new best player in the league because nobody on the Celtics is quite at that level.</p>

<p>For people who like the soap opera/narrative aspect of basketball the Mavs had more going on because they were ready to crown Luka as the new best player in the world etc.</p>

      <label for="loe43rr" class="commentText"><p>I think it was more hopium than anything and a support for the under dog. It was abundantly clear that the Celtics looked like the most dominant team especially with Luka being beat up by that stage. Mix that with a team lots of people dislike, and a team that isn&rsquo;t particularly flashy (to some) and you got all the stupid takes that were seen
Edit also really refreshing to hear from an NBA player that matchups matter. So many playoffs could look so different if teams had played different teams</p>

<p>I think guys like Bron have warped our perception. He&rsquo;s better than Tatum but not by enough to drastically transform the series in a way that LeBron used to do against other guys he had the edge on.  The Celtics in general had everything you really need to stop the Mavericks.</p>

<p>Luka isn&rsquo;t better than Tatum to the point of warping the series, but Jokic is better than whatever big Boston wants to throw at him to that extent. Comparatively, AG will hold up fine against the wings of Boston.</p>

Losing Bruce brown was already a huge hit to their depth, now losing KCP means they have very little outside of their top 4 in Jokic/Murray/Gordon/MPJ. If Murray and MPJ don’t become like top 20 players or at least more consistent/well rounded, then nuggets are gonna struggle in long playoff runs</p>

Only two game sample size, I know, but DAL was never even seen as a serious threat until they started knocking off good teams. Their run isn&rsquo;t totally dissimilar to Boston&rsquo;s run in 2022 (coming off a bad season; rough start to the season; ended on fire, but had a tough playoff matchups throughout).</p>

<p>malone was plahing jokic 40 mins a game and played him 46+ in game 7.  The bench  averaged in 16 a game vs the wolves.</p>

<p>why cant people just say the Celtics were one of the most dominant teams ever. Im not even a celtics fan but they were dominant all season and all playoffs. (mavs fan)</p>
