<blockquote>
<p>“People always ask me, when did you guys know you were going to win a championship?” Tatum said. “When Minnesota beat Denver, I felt like Denver was the only team that they matched up best with us. I thought that we were going to play Denver in the Finals and it was going to be a good one.</p>

<p>But when we were in Dallas and we went up, 3-0, oh my God. Nobody has ever come back from 0-3, so I remember getting back to the locker room and I remember saying, I don’t know what game it’s going to be, but we’re going to win the championship. That was a weird feeling. I wasn’t able to sleep that night and I remember the morning of Game 4 we had shootaround, and I had never been in the position that if we win tonight, we’re champions. We were at shootaround and everybody was trying to act normal. I couldn’t take a nap. We lost by like 30. We wanted to win so bad. We were so anxious and so tight. But I knew when we were coming back home for Game 5, we were going to win.”</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious that the Celtics are a nightmare matchup for the Mavs similar to how Denver was a nightmare matchup for the Heat in 2023</p>

<p>Somehow analysts decided to unironically pick on &ldquo;vibes&rdquo;</p>

Now that we know the outcome, those same analysts are saying that the Mavs having a harder road means they were more banged up and likely to lose vs the Celtics.</p>

      <label for="lodplgl" class="commentText"><p>that talking point in the leadup was so confusing. I kept pointing back at the 2022 Celtics, we also went through a gauntlet in the East to get to the Finals. guess what happened when we got there? we had zero gas left and basically got ran off the floor the last two games.</p>

<p>having a tougher road to the Finals is a <em>bad</em> thing. playing a lower number of games against lesser competition conserves stamina and ultimately gives you a better chance of winning the championship, and that’s why playoff seeding is designed to give the best performing regular season teams the most advantageous matchups</p>

<p>The spurs and Lakers won 10 titles combined in the span of 20 years.</p>

<p>They definitely had the toughest road to the finals every year in the west and I feel like that gauntlet is what made them destroy the eastern conference so much.</p>

<p>It’s like sharpening your sword with steel (western conference teams) vs sharpening your sword with aluminum (Eastern conference teams)</p>

<p>I’m talking of the East back in the 2000s, when they had 2 or 3 teams make the playoffs with sub .500 records.</p>

Now boston from 08-10 was a battle because they were equal. However if boston was beating up on the east with little resistance they are 3 peating because of the battles lal and sas went thru to get to the finals. Facing an equal team in the finals if one went thru hell and the other is resting doesn&rsquo;t help the fatigued team at all</p>

<p>Also lets not pretend Cs didn&rsquo;t have to prove they could take that final step. Yes this squad was better but that Warriors series was also somewhat winnable.</p>

<p>I think most of us true neutrals in that series expected the &lsquo;best player on losing team&rsquo; type of Finals like LeBron&rsquo;s first Cavs finals or something.</p>

Losing Bruce brown was already a huge hit to their depth, now losing KCP means they have very little outside of their top 4 in Jokic/Murray/Gordon/MPJ. If Murray and MPJ don’t become like top 20 players or at least more consistent/well rounded, then nuggets are gonna struggle in long playoff runs</p>

Even as Kyrie choked time and time again (not that he was the reason they lost) the slander was on Tatum</p>
