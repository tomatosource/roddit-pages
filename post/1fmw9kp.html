<blockquote>
<p>“People always ask me, when did you guys know you were going to win a championship?” Tatum said. “When Minnesota beat Denver, I felt like Denver was the only team that they matched up best with us. I thought that we were going to play Denver in the Finals and it was going to be a good one.</p>

<p>But when we were in Dallas and we went up, 3-0, oh my God. Nobody has ever come back from 0-3, so I remember getting back to the locker room and I remember saying, I don’t know what game it’s going to be, but we’re going to win the championship. That was a weird feeling. I wasn’t able to sleep that night and I remember the morning of Game 4 we had shootaround, and I had never been in the position that if we win tonight, we’re champions. We were at shootaround and everybody was trying to act normal. I couldn’t take a nap. We lost by like 30. We wanted to win so bad. We were so anxious and so tight. But I knew when we were coming back home for Game 5, we were going to win.”</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious that the Celtics are a nightmare matchup for the Mavs similar to how Denver was a nightmare matchup for the Heat in 2023</p>

<p>Somehow analysts decided to unironically pick on &ldquo;vibes&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lodplgl" class="commentText"><p>that talking point in the leadup was so confusing. I kept pointing back at the 2022 Celtics, we also went through a gauntlet in the East to get to the Finals. guess what happened when we got there? we had zero gas left and basically got ran off the floor the last two games.</p>

<p>having a tougher road to the Finals is a <em>bad</em> thing. playing a lower number of games against lesser competition conserves stamina and ultimately gives you a better chance of winning the championship, and that’s why playoff seeding is designed to give the best performing regular season teams the most advantageous matchups</p>

<p>The spurs and Lakers won 10 titles combined in the span of 20 years.</p>

<p>They definitely had the toughest road to the finals every year in the west and I feel like that gauntlet is what made them destroy the eastern conference so much.</p>

<p>It’s like sharpening your sword with steel (western conference teams) vs sharpening your sword with aluminum (Eastern conference teams)</p>

<p>I’m talking of the East back in the 2000s, when they had 2 or 3 teams make the playoffs with sub .500 records.</p>

Now boston from 08-10 was a battle because they were equal. However if boston was beating up on the east with little resistance they are 3 peating because of the battles lal and sas went thru to get to the finals.

      <label for="lodyl3n" class="commentText"><p>What they really need to do is have the #1 and #2 seeds face off in the first round, then have the winner face the other conference&rsquo;s #1 seed in the Conference Semis, followed by the All-Time Lakers roster in the Conference Finals, then when you inevitably beat the 8 seed left standing in the NBA Finals we can all say we&rsquo;re obviously not moved because you beat a play-in team for the championship</p>

They had by far the best season of any team, they steamrolled through the east in the playoffs, there was no sexy narrative to push there other than &ldquo;the Celtics were simply a much better constructed team than everyone else.&rdquo; Couldn&rsquo;t even crown someone as the new best player in the league because nobody on the Celtics is quite at that level.</p>

<p>For people who like the soap opera/narrative aspect of basketball the Mavs had more going on because they were ready to crown Luka as the new best player in the world etc.</p>

      <label for="loe43rr" class="commentText"><p>I think it was more hopium than anything and a support for the under dog. It was abundantly clear that the Celtics looked like the most dominant team especially with Luka being beat up by that stage. Mix that with a team lots of people dislike, and a team that isn&rsquo;t particularly flashy (to some) and you got all the stupid takes that were seen
Edit also really refreshing to hear from an NBA player that matchups matter. So many playoffs could look so different if teams had played different teams</p>

      <label for="lodwiyv" class="commentText"><p>As a Celtics fan I’ll make the case. Yes, the Celtics were a great team all season, but just because you’re great in the regular season, there’s no guarantee that it will translate throughout the postseason. Dallas was an ascending team, and after their fantastic trades at the deadline, they had played some of the best basketball in the league.</p>

<p>In the playoffs, the Mavs were either in every series, or took over the series convincingly. Their take down of the Timberwolves, who had beaten a tough defending champion Nuggets team, was eye opening to say the least. PJ, Gafford and Lively had given the Mavs a totally different dimension that made them a multifaceted offense.</p>

<p>I went into the Finals with a healthy respect for the Mavs and it wasn’t until after Game 3 that I thought it was a lock. Definitely didn’t see us sweeping them, and Tatum’s quote was a reason why. Human nature kicks in, and for a team like the Celtics who had yet to win it all, they were susceptible to it. Still so happy the Celtics were able to win it all, especially for Big Al!</p>

      <label for="loe3fud" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, but Jokic couldnt just get past him because Gobert was waiting to help.</p>

<p>Them switching it up with both Naz and KAT being on Jokic just drained him a ton.</p>

<p>Still gotta give it to KAT, he certainly did exactly what was needed.</p>

<p>do you have faith that you just had a bad draw and have still have a team that can make the finals? do you reconstruct to beat your nemesis at the cost of weakening your team to another powerhouse? do you reconstruct drastically to appease a fan base that doesn’t think you’re getting anywhere?</p>

Only two game sample size, I know, but DAL was never even seen as a serious threat until they started knocking off good teams. Their run isn&rsquo;t totally dissimilar to Boston&rsquo;s run in 2022 (coming off a bad season; rough start to the season; ended on fire, but had a tough playoff matchups throughout).</p>

      <label for="loe3reh" class="commentText"><p>Hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>. KP was hurt. Luka was the best player on the court. Tatum had been struggling all playoffs. The Celtics had an extremely easy road to the finals compared to the Mavs. Kyrie was playing at an elite level, he looked like he was on a revenge tour, and Boston fans were the last name left to get checked off his list. Dallas was playing good defense while Luka and Kyrie were appearing to be arguably the best backcourt in NBA history. The &ldquo;story&rdquo; looked like it was writing itself.  I was rooting for Boston, and my mind thought Boston would win, but I definitely put money on the Mavs jic.</p>
