<blockquote>
<p>“People always ask me, when did you guys know you were going to win a championship?” Tatum said. “When Minnesota beat Denver, I felt like Denver was the only team that they matched up best with us. I thought that we were going to play Denver in the Finals and it was going to be a good one.</p>

<p>But when we were in Dallas and we went up, 3-0, oh my God. Nobody has ever come back from 0-3, so I remember getting back to the locker room and I remember saying, I don’t know what game it’s going to be, but we’re going to win the championship. That was a weird feeling. I wasn’t able to sleep that night and I remember the morning of Game 4 we had shootaround, and I had never been in the position that if we win tonight, we’re champions. We were at shootaround and everybody was trying to act normal. I couldn’t take a nap. We lost by like 30. We wanted to win so bad. We were so anxious and so tight. But I knew when we were coming back home for Game 5, we were going to win.”</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious that the Celtics are a nightmare matchup for the Mavs similar to how Denver was a nightmare matchup for the Heat in 2023</p>

<p>Somehow analysts decided to unironically pick on &ldquo;vibes&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="loe9hhj" class="commentText"><p>A lot of it probably has to do with the Celtics probably being good for a long time. The team was a sort of known quantity and people tend to latch on to the big new thing, which the C’s certainly aren’t despite the dominant season.</p>

<p>The team is also filled with somewhat boring personalities which is great as a fan of the team but won’t attract the attention of the casual fan.</p>

      <label for="loefbpb" class="commentText"><p>It was that, plus the facts that 1) every team the Celtics played before the finals were injured, so people thought they weren&rsquo;t as good as they actually were, 2) like the person above said, everyone was losing their minds about Luka and Kyrie, and 3) there was soooo much time off between the conference finals and the finals. So people just talked themselves into the idea that Luka and Kyrie were one of the greatest duos of all time (like, that was actually a thing people were saying) while simultaneously losing sight of the fact that the Celtics were incredibly dominant all season. It&rsquo;s honestly still funny to go back and listen to the podcasts from before the finals&hellip; even &ldquo;smart&rdquo; people like KOC were picking the mavs, it was truly wild haha</p>

      <label for="lofdyhq" class="commentText"><p>In no small part because players are judged differently.</p>

<p>Luka struggled against GSW in the 2022 WCF but no one really talked about it because they were too busy talking about Tatum&rsquo;s struggles in the finals that year.</p>

<p>Kyrie has really only had 1 playoff run in his career where he was consistently good. All other years he&rsquo;s been injured, had series long cold streaks or missed the playoffs entirely.</p>

<p>Whereas Tatum and Brown have spent most of their careers under a microscope. They get judged more harshly for losing in the later rounds than players who lose earlier on.</p>

<p>NBA is most definitely a league where losing one or two finals is not a predictor of you losing a third.</p>

Now that we know the outcome, those same analysts are saying that the Mavs having a harder road means they were more banged up and likely to lose vs the Celtics.</p>

      <label for="lodplgl" class="commentText"><p>that talking point in the leadup was so confusing. I kept pointing back at the 2022 Celtics, we also went through a gauntlet in the East to get to the Finals. guess what happened when we got there? we had zero gas left and basically got ran off the floor the last two games.</p>

<p>having a tougher road to the Finals is a <em>bad</em> thing. playing a lower number of games against lesser competition conserves stamina and ultimately gives you a better chance of winning the championship, and that’s why playoff seeding is designed to give the best performing regular season teams the most advantageous matchups</p>

<p>The spurs and Lakers won 10 titles combined in the span of 20 years.</p>

<p>They definitely had the toughest road to the finals every year in the west and I feel like that gauntlet is what made them destroy the eastern conference so much.</p>

<p>It’s like sharpening your sword with steel (western conference teams) vs sharpening your sword with aluminum (Eastern conference teams)</p>

<p>I’m talking of the East back in the 2000s, when they had 2 or 3 teams make the playoffs with sub .500 records.</p>

Now boston from 08-10 was a battle because they were equal. However if boston was beating up on the east with little resistance they are 3 peating because of the battles lal and sas went thru to get to the finals. Facing an equal team in the finals if one went thru hell and the other is resting doesn&rsquo;t help the fatigued team at all</p>

They had by far the best season of any team, they steamrolled through the east in the playoffs, there was no sexy narrative to push there other than &ldquo;the Celtics were simply a much better constructed team than everyone else.&rdquo; Couldn&rsquo;t even crown someone as the new best player in the league because nobody on the Celtics is quite at that level.</p>

<p>For people who like the soap opera/narrative aspect of basketball the Mavs had more going on because they were ready to crown Luka as the new best player in the world etc.</p>

<p>I think guys like Bron have warped our perception. He&rsquo;s better than Tatum but not by enough to drastically transform the series in a way that LeBron used to do against other guys he had the edge on.  The Celtics in general had everything you really need to stop the Mavericks.</p>

      <label for="loeom7d" class="commentText"><p>Well they started with Gobert on Gordon and KAT on Jokic which stifled their offense in games 1 and 2. Then the Nuggets responded by having Gordon bring the ball up more which had the double effect of making it so Murray wouldn&rsquo;t get harrased full court and Gobert wouldn&rsquo;t want to guard Gordon all the way in the back court. They also ran a lot of <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> screens to force Gobert on Jokic. By the end Minnesota just stopped switching and let Jokic bomb away a bunch of missed threes.</p>

Celtics are the more talented team and probably still will, but the nuggets have a team makeup that matches up really well against the Celtics.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for the nuggets would have been Jrue/white locking down Murray in the finals.</p>

      <label for="loeilna" class="commentText"><p>Okay, I get that Bruce Brown is a great player and I loved having him on the team, but like… we really need to stop this narrative because it’s kinda nonsense.</p>

<p>The reason Denver struggled so much against the Wolves is that all of our guards were injured. If we still have BB, there’s just as much of a chance that he gets injured before the playoffs as Reggie, and that almost guarantees that we’re fucked. The fact that we took the Wolves to 7 is a testament to just how insanely hard Jokic can carry a team when he wants to.</p>

Losing Bruce brown was already a huge hit to their depth, now losing KCP means they have very little outside of their top 4 in Jokic/Murray/Gordon/MPJ. If Murray and MPJ don’t become like top 20 players or at least more consistent/well rounded, then nuggets are gonna struggle in long playoff runs</p>

Only two game sample size, I know, but DAL was never even seen as a serious threat until they started knocking off good teams. Their run isn&rsquo;t totally dissimilar to Boston&rsquo;s run in 2022 (coming off a bad season; rough start to the season; ended on fire, but had a tough playoff matchups throughout).</p>

      <label for="lodpr60" class="commentText"><p>I was hoping Luka and company were going to put some more resistance but I agree with Tatum. The Denver nuggets and a healthy Milwaukee bucks were the only teams where I felt Boston was vulnerable. There was a game I remember between nuggets and C&rsquo;s where biston was playing catch up the whole time.</p>

      <label for="loeowzd" class="commentText"><p>That was their strategy, the reason only Luka had decent stats in the finals is because they played moneyball with Luka. They made sure Luka couldn&rsquo;t lob or be open enough to pass, they just kept pushing him into uncomfortable spots and forced him to waste his clock so he had to shoot.</p>

<p>So that way the Mavs aren&rsquo;t completely changing their strategy by making Luka go off ball since they&rsquo;re comfortable with him having it, Cs just made sure all the weapons Luka has is not there at his disposal.</p>

<p>I can only imagine how different the outcome would be if instead of having the worst open 3pt % shooter in THJ we had Klay. And Naji. And Grimes. And Dinwiddie…</p>

<p>That already looks like a completely different team with way more scoring</p>

I guess we will see during the next couple of seasons if this young Dallas team will follow a similar trajectory to you.
Im predicting a rematch between these teams in one of the next 2 seasons</p>

      <label for="loenf6l" class="commentText"><p>In the <em>76th</em> year of the NBA, Joel Embiid, who plays for the Philadelphia *76*ers won the MVP, but lost the war, as he was humiliated by everybody after a poor performance in Game 7 against the Celtics and his biggest competitor won the championship with an all-time historic performance.</p>

<p>In the <em>77th</em> year of the NBA, Luka Doncic, who wears #77, made it to the Finals, but lost against the one player his fans hate most and complain about the most as it relates to when they are compared.</p>

<p>malone was plahing jokic 40 mins a game and played him 46+ in game 7.  The bench  averaged in 16 a game vs the wolves.</p>

<p>why cant people just say the Celtics were one of the most dominant teams ever. Im not even a celtics fan but they were dominant all season and all playoffs. (mavs fan)</p>
