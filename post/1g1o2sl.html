</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Strong debut from Paul George in an otherwise ugly half of basketball. He was clearly the best player on the court for the Sixers as they finished the half down 17. He made a number of contested, pull-up threes and airballed a relatively easier one to provide the fans some comedic relief.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nba.com/game/phi-vs-min-0012400032/box-score" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/game/phi-vs-min-0012400032/box-score</a></p>

<p>Edit: He’s back out there in the second half; I did not expect this. He finished 23/6/2 on 70 TS% (4-9 on 3PA) and was a +6 in 26 minutes. I am a fraud.</p>

      <label for="lrifsvh" class="commentText"><p>He’s not a top tier defender anymore in the sense that you can count on him to 1v1 superstars every single night like you used to, but he’s still a very good defender when locked in, his fall from All Defense status has some to do with physical decline, but a lot to do with concentration lapses, which I’m sure you’ll see a few times this season. Offense isn’t as good as ever either, but he was really efficient when the Clips were healthy because he’s become an excellent off ball player, he’ll feast with Maxey and Embiid and give you some very efficient offense, but sadly he’s not a go-to scorer anymore.</p>

      <label for="lrizc36" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I agree. It’ll be easier for George to defend with embiid behind him compared to zubac. Plus oubre isn’t bad and maxey isn’t bad. George may not even have to guard the best player every night. Nor does he have to carry the offense every night. That means he can put more energy into playing defense.</p>

<p>Current Paul George is a perfect fit, and he is who was available. Obviously 2018 PG would be better but I doubt he&rsquo;d be available in that case lol.</p>

Obviously is not capable of being the primary scorer, and I’d argue he hasn’t been for a few years, even though he can still occasionally take over. However, as a 3rd option, I wouldn’t be surprised if he has his most efficient season.</p>

      <label for="lrhxomp" class="commentText"><p>We were pretty much ignoring how desperately we needed a traditional wing player the second we signed Harris&rsquo; contract. Oubre feeling like a revelation in the postseason for doing basic hyperathletic 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; things was a wakeup call.</p>

They’re going to be eager to get Pg involved this year. Excited to see if Maxey can make a jump in the playmaking department with PG around too.</p>
