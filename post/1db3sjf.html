<p>They dont have to be right or wrong because its all subjective trash, so no one can fact check them.  And its all meaningless, so by the time they are done saying the garbage, its already on to the next stupidity.  Guys like Kevin O&rsquo;Connor have perfected this.</p>

<p>Its crazy that an industry exists where if you removed <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of its personnel, that everything gets better</p>

I&rsquo;ve listened to a good amount of basketball podcasts and even the good ones are so often middling reflections of recent win/loss records. I&rsquo;m sure they understand the game at a much deeper level but I hear so much on pace, toughness, clutch factor, and &ldquo;the guy&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l7po4xk" class="commentText"><p>Even saying it was surface level is a compliment to how dogshit the analysis has been.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched ESPN/FS1 in years so maybe it was this bad all along, but I watched a couple videos after Game 1 and the talking heads have been completely useless.</p>

<p>The analysis has basically been &ldquo;if Dallas plays better and scores more points, they can win.&rdquo; Skip Bayless even said &ldquo;if the Mavs make 8 more 3s, it&rsquo;s a totally different game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I get that some of them are trying to farm engagement through rage bait, but the WHOLE product is like that. I don&rsquo;t know how you say those types of things without being embarrassed.</p>

<p>If he wants to seriously be a HC, he needs to start as an assistant</p>

<p>He probably thinks he&rsquo;s entitled to skip the line , but having a podcast and his career isn&rsquo;t the juice he thinks it is</p>

<p>Especially when there are other candidates like Sam Cassell , a former player who won titles, put in long years as an assistant on successful teams under different HCs, who wouldn&rsquo;t be learning on the job.</p>

      <label for="l7pgbyr" class="commentText"><p>The great ones are obsessed with that shit. When Thibs was fired from the TWolves, he went to a couple different places like Golden State and others to watch and observe how they ran things, going to coaching summits/camps, etc. On top of having a reputation for being a psychopath that spends all day and night studying film with no personal life. JJ probably thinks he‚Äôs at that level because I‚Äôve heard him on a recent podcast being like ‚ÄúOh man I‚Äôm SO BUSY! I recorded 9 hours worth of podcasts this week and had to travel to call games!‚Äù Like buddy‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a light week for a HC lol.</p>

<p>On the other hand - until this whole Lakers thing started, he&rsquo;d repeatedly be explaining that he was a complete beginner in coaching and was learning from having just recently started teaching kids. He sounded very much like a dude who knew he was green.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t pretend to know whether he should be getting a shot but I do know that there are very good reasons to doubt JJ is the answer the Lakers are looking for. When it comes down to it, most good coaches in the NBA are coaches that know how to manage their players well. It&rsquo;s not just about knowing basketball.</p>

      <label for="l7okcpr" class="commentText"><p>How do you bring up Jason Kidd in this convo when in order for him to be finally considered a good coach, it took him 10 years of being an NBA head coach and assistant?</p>

<p>He was considered hot out of the gate in Brooklyn and got poached by the Bucks after one year.  But his reputation went down the drain while in Milwaukee, got fired after 4 seasons.  He spent two years as an assistant.  Got hired by the Mavs and people were still saying he wasn&rsquo;t good until this season.  It took a lot for him to get where he is.</p>

<p>Pat didn‚Äôt just go from being a nobody commentator to HC like some people think. So the Riley parallels are ridiculous, too.</p>

Kidd <del>is at worst</del> has a solid argument to be a top 5 PG of all time and one of the first players you would think of when talking about making adjustments to your game to extend your career.</p>

<p>JJ sounds somewhat intelligent on his podcast and is friends with LeBron. These are not the same thing.</p>

      <label for="l7ok2b6" class="commentText"><p>Kerr worked in NBA front offices alongside coaches sitting at the meetings and dinner tables absorbing shit for a fucking decade get the fuck out of here with Kerr as an example. He was a engineer who helped build the 7 Seconds of Less Suns and <em>took what he learned</em> to build the Warriors later on.</p>

<p>Kidd also failed miserably as the Bucks head coach at first. (So many stories have came out like in the book about Giannis.) Kidd also spent his entire career reading defenses and choosing plays like a QB and Redick did not sort of like a nice WR who finished plays and excelled in his role. It&rsquo;s less suprising Kidd was able to eventually figure it out after a few stops of failing, but took his lumps on the way too.</p>

<p>If I was Anthony Davis or DLo I don&rsquo;t blame them for saying they don&rsquo;t want to be Redicks first failure on his way to he a good coach one day like Kidd is now. Or worse, an anecdote season of further coach firings.</p>

<p>The comments on the first few episodes of Mind the Game were a bunch of hoop heads laughing at Redick for using Xs for (O)ffense and Os for D. he responded in an episode saying <em>WeLl IvE oNlY CoAcHEd 8 yEaR oLdS and it&rsquo;s EaSiEr fOR tHeM!</em> (while EVERY episode LeBron talks out plays and calls opposing bigs the X5 every time)</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s absolutely not ready to be a head coach at college or NBA. I am a longtime Duke and JJ fan since his sophomore season at Duke. But his first stint as a coach will be bumpy</p>

      <label for="l7olf2g" class="commentText"><p>I think JJ only seems arrogant in this context because he spends way too much time engaging with twitter and first take. He&rsquo;s constantly trying to fight these &ldquo;narratives&rdquo; instead of just ignoring them. Those takes <em>are</em> terrible, and he&rsquo;s not wrong to shit on them. But constantly doing that builds a pattern over time.</p>

<p>In my armchair phycology opinion he actually seems to have decent self awareness of his arrogance that came from being a top recruit / college player. Which is about as good as you can expect.</p>

      <label for="l7ppf0f" class="commentText"><p>My armchair psych take is that JJ would be a terrible fit in the state that he&rsquo;s in now. There&rsquo;s more to being a coach than just thinking you&rsquo;re always right. That is an easy thing to suppress, for example, most people work at places where they believe everyone else is stupid, and most people actually keep that to themselves. That part is easy to manage</p>

<p>The hard part is when things don&rsquo;t go your way and you have to be wrong and adapt to the situation you&rsquo;re in. Basically, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re the smartest person in the room if you&rsquo;re not willing to sacrifice parts of yourself to bring everyone together, and I think the biggest sacrifice JJ would need to make is going through situations where he&rsquo;s 100% right but he has to be wrong for the sake of everyone else</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re nervous about something and I know there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about, and I try to tell you this but it just makes it worse for you. No amount of logic will make you feel better because it&rsquo;s not a logic problem for you. So even though I&rsquo;m not emotionally involved and I see a logical solution to your problem, I still need to support you.</p>

<p>And even though I don&rsquo;t know JJ personally, I&rsquo;ve met people who have presented themselves the same way he does. Maybe he&rsquo;s completely playing a character, but if he&rsquo;s not, then he *really* values his intelligence and being right because that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s been most of his life, so out the gate, he&rsquo;s not going to have the tools to support these players. That&rsquo;s why people are saying he needs to be an assistant first. He needs to learn that pure intelligence only matters when people are checked in, but if he does _one_ thing in today&rsquo;s league that causes people to check out then no amount of intelligence will be able to bring them back</p>

      <label for="l7os3vd" class="commentText"><p>That reminds me of a story of meeting him in a grocery store in LA once. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.</p>

<p>He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù</p>

<p>I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.</p>

<p>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.</p>

<p>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>

<p>It just made it look better compared to Stephen A Smith yelling random hot takes at the camera or neutered watered versions of analysis people like Jeff Van Gundy are forced to say on air so they don&rsquo;t scare off viewers (just look how they already neutered Tony Romo).</p>

<p>The fact an NBA team actually seriously considered Reddick is fucking hilarious. It&rsquo;s like Captain Kirk getting hired as head of NASA because he did a great job in Star Trek.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know if he will be a good coach, but NBA teams hiring processes involve a whole lot more than turning on first take or whatever.</p>

<p>Except the lakers, they suck.</p>

He isn&rsquo;t arrogant so much as comically detail-oriented and particular. You can tell how he became such a great shooter and off-ball player.</p>

<p>I can see him clashing with some players, and those players would probably call him arrogant, but IMO those aren&rsquo;t guys you want on your roster if you can help it.</p>

<p>Most the video is full of him being self deprecating and contributing his wife with her good artistic choices.</p>

<p>And sure, he loves art as well but some people think thag alone is pretentious which is just dumb as hell.</p>

<p>But yeah, this whole post and past ones keep solidifying my opinion that people who can‚Äôt deal with someone being confident leads them to think they‚Äôre being condescended and talked down to which I just can‚Äôt agree with.</p>

      <label for="l7ol9lp" class="commentText"><p>Probably because it‚Äôs his podcasts, and we don‚Äôt know how he‚Äôs like behind the cameras.</p>

<p>But I will say from his podcasts, he argues like a redittor. Or just someone chronically online. He will cherry pick statistics that fit whatever point he‚Äôs making (at times, not always) and it‚Äôs sort of the thing on here where he‚Äôll site advanced stats and act like it‚Äôs the holy grail when it can be a lil more nuanced than that. Kind of like the smart guy that‚Äôs gotta remind everyone he‚Äôs so smart.</p>

<p>It sometimes does come across as arrogance. For some reason, he seems to always remind us that he played in the NBA. That he played in high level games. That he knows a little bit about what x star is experiencing. And he knows more about that than 99.9% of his listeners, but it‚Äôs sort of annoying.</p>

<p>And again, referring to stats or something doesn‚Äôt make him arrogant, he‚Äôs just stating that he thinks x or y backs up an opinion he has and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs sticking to.</p>

<p>If he wasn‚Äôt confident in his opinions then everyone would complain he‚Äôs wishy washy and has no backbone.</p>

      <label for="l7oof1l" class="commentText"><p>You‚Äôve misread or misinterpreted my comment.</p>

<p>I understand Redick drawing from his playing career to make points. It‚Äôs just annoying to reiterate it consistently to some points that don‚Äôt require it, and a little weird to try and relate their experience in the NBA to that of a star player, outside of a few things, when JJ was always a role player. A good role player, but not a star.</p>

<p>Referring to stats doesn‚Äôt make him arrogant. The manner in which he does it sometimes is. And citing the conclusion you get from a stat as absolute fact, is either arrogant or disingenuous. There‚Äôs more to the story than just stats or advanced stats. And often times he will cite some stat and not have any nuance based on that.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs nothing be wrong with being confident in your opinion. Nowhere did I say that. But it‚Äôs the continous effort to be right or create strawmans to prove his point. Before he even finishes stating his opinion, he immediately states how he knows twitter is gonna disagree, or that there‚Äôs stupid arguments on twitter say   x that that is so dumb, and all this shit about NBA twitter.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt listen to his OM3 podcast consistently.</p>
