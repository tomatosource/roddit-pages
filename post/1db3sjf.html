<p>If he wants to seriously be a HC, he needs to start as an assistant</p>

<p>He probably thinks he&rsquo;s entitled to skip the line , but having a podcast and his career isn&rsquo;t the juice he thinks it is</p>

<p>Especially when there are other candidates like Sam Cassell , a former player who won titles, put in long years as an assistant on successful teams under different HCs, who wouldn&rsquo;t be learning on the job.</p>

<p>I get some people view NBA coaching as a joke , especially compared to NFL coaching, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be that big of a joke.</p>

      <label for="l7op0k9" class="commentText"><p>Would you say Duke fans today have earned their negative perception more than Celtics fans today?  Seems to me there are a lot of similarities in how yall have been viewed for decades since before I was alive. Makeup and behavior of Boston fans seems to me to have changed for the better alot more since bussing to desegregate the schools than that of Duke fans.  Anecdotally from initially attending an elite private school out East that has similar demographics to Duke, I&rsquo;m even less inclined to think they&rsquo;ve changed much at all.  Best of luck to yall in the series though of course I&rsquo;m pulling for my boys out West and Scott Foster.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t pretend to know whether he should be getting a shot but I do know that there are very good reasons to doubt JJ is the answer the Lakers are looking for. When it comes down to it, most good coaches in the NBA are coaches that know how to manage their players well. It&rsquo;s not just about knowing basketball.</p>

He was the white guy at Duke&hellip; it&rsquo;s tradition to hate these archetypes.  Sorry, but if fans are chanting horrible things about your mom, I&rsquo;m pushing back and shoving out in their faces.  His podcasts aren&rsquo;t arrogant either.  I tend to like coaches with a bit of edge, but people always confuse confidence as arrogance</p>

<p>That said, I do agree being assistant coach would be best first. But big names don’t really need to cuz they get hired to be HC off the bat.</p>

<p>He was considered hot out of the gate in Brooklyn and got poached by the Bucks after one year.  But his reputation went down the drain while in Milwaukee, got fired after 4 seasons.  He spent two years as an assistant.  Got hired by the Mavs and people were still saying he wasn&rsquo;t good until this season.  It took a lot for him to get where he is.</p>

And I never said Kidd (or Magic) were good coaches off the bat… I’m saying there is a precedent of former players being hired with no coaching experience.</p>

<p>It just astounds me people are so flummoxed by JJ potentially being hired as a head coach with no prior experience when the NBA has showed it doesn’t really care about that lol.</p>

Kidd is at worst a top 5 PG of all time and one of the first players you would think of when talking about making adjustments to your game to extend your career.</p>

<p>JJ sounds somewhat intelligent on his podcast and is friends with LeBron. These are not the same thing.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that “winning games.” It means you’re taking a risk on hiring a HC without any coaching experience.</p>

<p>OK, this guy may have that con, but as a pro, he has front office experience and learned what coaching looked like from two of the greatest ever.</p>

<p>OK, this guy may have that con, but he was the definition of a “coach on the floor” during his HoF career.</p>

<p>OK, this guy may have that con, but he has a super successful podcast and had a solid career as a catch-and-shoot 3 point specialist role player. </p>

      <label for="l7ok2b6" class="commentText"><p>Kerr worked in NBA front offices alongside coaches sitting at the meetings and dinner tables absorbing shit for a fucking decade get the fuck out of here with Kerr as an example. He was a engineer who helped build the 7 Seconds of Less Suns and <em>took what he learned</em> to build the Warriors later on.</p>

<p>Kidd also failed miserably as the Bucks head coach at first. (So many stories have came out like in the book about Giannis.) Kidd also spent his entire career reading defenses and choosing plays like a QB and Redick did not sort of like a nice WR who finished plays and excelled in his role. It&rsquo;s less suprising Kidd was able to eventually figure it out after a few stops of failing, but took his lumps on the way too.</p>

<p>If I was Anthony Davis or DLo I don&rsquo;t blame them for saying they don&rsquo;t want to be Redicks first failure on his way to he a good coach one day like Kidd is now. Or worse, an anecdote season of further coach firings.</p>

<p>The comments on the first few episodes of Mind the Game were a bunch of hoop heads laughing at Redick for using Xs for (O)ffense and Os for D. he responded in an episode saying <em>WeLl IvE oNlY CoAcHEd 8 yEaR oLdS and it&rsquo;s EaSiEr fOR tHeM!</em> (while EVERY episode LeBron talks out plays and calls opposing bigs the X5 every time)</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s absolutely not ready to be a head coach at college or NBA. I am a longtime Duke and JJ fan since his sophomore season at Duke. But his first stint as a coach will be bumpy</p>

He&rsquo;s constantly trying to fight these &ldquo;narratives&rdquo; instead of just ignoring them. Those takes <em>are</em> terrible, and he&rsquo;s not wrong to shit on them. But constantly doing that builds a pattern over time.</p>

<p>In my armchair phycology opinion he actually seems to have decent self awareness of his arrogance that came from being a top recruit / college player. Which is about as good as you can expect.</p>

<p>B. Having a high IQ does not mean you get to talk down to someone. The issue here isn&rsquo;t that no one understands him, it&rsquo;s that we understand him and he can&rsquo;t make his points in a non-&ldquo;i&rsquo;m a duke frat boy&rdquo; way. Forget society, there is no individual who will accept being talked down to no matter how dumb they are.</p>

      <label for="l7opqdq" class="commentText"><p>Again I can&rsquo;t stress enough how everything JJ says or his entire analysis is very standard run of the mill shit every assistant to assistant coach knows/does.</p>

<p>It just made it look better compared to Stephen A Smith yelling random hot takes at the camera or neutered watered versions of analysis people like Jeff Van Gundy are forced to say on air so they don&rsquo;t scare off viewers (just look how they already neutered Tony Romo).</p>

<p>The fact an NBA team actually seriously considered Reddick is fucking hilarious. It&rsquo;s like Captain Kirk getting hired as head of NASA because he did a great job in Star Trek.</p>

<ul>
<li>were closing in on Redick, paused because of the aspect mentioned in the title</li>
<li><em>asked Woj</em>, hey do you know if there&rsquo;s anyone else out there</li>
<li>Woj (driven in part by his strong relationship with the Hurley family), floats the idea of coaching the Lakers to Dan Hurley</li>
<li>Lakers get tied to Hurley</li>
</ul>

<p>but Woj has been saying Hurley was the target all along. this suggests Shams wasnt BSing, but Woj power-brokered a way to get Hurley in when he saw an opportunity</p>

      <label for="l7ol9lp" class="commentText"><p>Probably because it’s his podcasts, and we don’t know how he’s like behind the cameras.</p>

<p>But I will say from his podcasts, he argues like a redittor. Or just someone chronically online. He will cherry pick statistics that fit whatever point he’s making (at times, not always) and it’s sort of the thing on here where he’ll site advanced stats and act like it’s the holy grail when it can be a lil more nuanced than that. Kind of like the smart guy that’s gotta remind everyone he’s so smart.</p>

<p>It sometimes does come across as arrogance. For some reason, he seems to always remind us that he played in the NBA. That he played in high level games. That he knows a little bit about what x star is experiencing. And he knows more about that than 99.9% of his listeners, but it’s sort of annoying.</p>

<p>And again, referring to stats or something doesn’t make him arrogant, he’s just stating that he thinks x or y backs up an opinion he has and that’s what he’s sticking to.</p>

<p>If he wasn’t confident in his opinions then everyone would complain he’s wishy washy and has no backbone.</p>

      <label for="l7oof1l" class="commentText"><p>You’ve misread or misinterpreted my comment.</p>

<p>I understand Redick drawing from his playing career to make points. It’s just annoying to reiterate it consistently to some points that don’t require it, and a little weird to try and relate their experience in the NBA to that of a star player, outside of a few things, when JJ was always a role player. A good role player, but not a star.</p>

<p>Referring to stats doesn’t make him arrogant. The manner in which he does it sometimes is. And citing the conclusion you get from a stat as absolute fact, is either arrogant or disingenuous. There’s more to the story than just stats or advanced stats. And often times he will cite some stat and not have any nuance based on that.</p>

<p>There’s nothing be wrong with being confident in your opinion. Nowhere did I say that. But it’s the continous effort to be right or create strawmans to prove his point. Before he even finishes stating his opinion, he immediately states how he knows twitter is gonna disagree, or that there’s stupid arguments on twitter say   x that that is so dumb, and all this shit about NBA twitter.</p>

<p>It’s why I can’t listen to his OM3 podcast consistently.</p>

He isn&rsquo;t arrogant so much as comically detail-oriented and particular. You can tell how he became such a great shooter and off-ball player.</p>

<p>I can see him clashing with some players, and those players would probably call him arrogant, but IMO those aren&rsquo;t guys you want on your roster if you can help it.</p>

<p>Most the video is full of him being self deprecating and contributing his wife with her good artistic choices.</p>

<p>And sure, he loves art as well but some people think thag alone is pretentious which is just dumb as hell.</p>

<p>But yeah, this whole post and past ones keep solidifying my opinion that people who can’t deal with someone being confident leads them to think they’re being condescended and talked down to which I just can’t agree with.</p>

He’s not exactly removed from the game. He’s been retired for a couple years , he played against these dudes. It’s just not going to work when a dude you talked shit to is now having to be coached by you.</p>
