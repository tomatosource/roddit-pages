<p>Absolutely zero people are paying to listen to John Fanta talk.  Put an ai speaking bag of potatoes on the camera and you would get the same impact</p>

<p>If he wants to seriously be a HC, he needs to start as an assistant</p>

<p>He probably thinks he&rsquo;s entitled to skip the line , but having a podcast and his career isn&rsquo;t the juice he thinks it is</p>

<p>Especially when there are other candidates like Sam Cassell , a former player who won titles, put in long years as an assistant on successful teams under different HCs, who wouldn&rsquo;t be learning on the job.</p>

<p>I get some people view NBA coaching as a joke , especially compared to NFL coaching, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be that big of a joke.</p>

<p>On the other hand - until this whole Lakers thing started, he&rsquo;d repeatedly be explaining that he was a complete beginner in coaching and was learning from having just recently started teaching kids. He sounded very much like a dude who knew he was green.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t pretend to know whether he should be getting a shot but I do know that there are very good reasons to doubt JJ is the answer the Lakers are looking for. When it comes down to it, most good coaches in the NBA are coaches that know how to manage their players well. It&rsquo;s not just about knowing basketball.</p>

<p>That said, I do agree being assistant coach would be best first. But big names don’t really need to cuz they get hired to be HC off the bat.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that “winning games.” It means you’re taking a risk on hiring a HC without any coaching experience.</p>

<p>OK, this guy may have that con, but as a pro, he has front office experience and learned what coaching looked like from two of the greatest ever.</p>

<p>OK, this guy may have that con, but he was the definition of a “coach on the floor” during his HoF career.</p>

<p>OK, this guy may have that con, but he has a super successful podcast and had a solid career as a catch-and-shoot 3 point specialist role player. </p>

<p>He was considered hot out of the gate in Brooklyn and got poached by the Bucks after one year.  But his reputation went down the drain while in Milwaukee, got fired after 4 seasons.  He spent two years as an assistant.  Got hired by the Mavs and people were still saying he wasn&rsquo;t good until this season.  It took a lot for him to get where he is.</p>

<p>Shifting goalposts is a common bad faith debate technique.</p>

<p>Apparently, even though there are coaches who have done that, it doesn’t count because of X, Y and Z <em>other</em> things they did. </p>

      <label for="l7ok2b6" class="commentText"><p>Kerr worked in NBA front offices alongside coaches sitting at the meetings and dinner tables absorbing shit for a fucking decade get the fuck out of here with Kerr as an example. He was a engineer who helped build the 7 Seconds of Less Suns and <em>took what he learned</em> to build the Warriors later on.</p>

<p>Kidd also failed miserably as the Bucks head coach at first. (So many stories have came out like in the book about Giannis.) Kidd also spent his entire career reading defenses and choosing plays like a QB and Redick did not sort of like a nice WR who finished plays and excelled in his role. It&rsquo;s less suprising Kidd was able to eventually figure it out after a few stops of failing, but took his lumps on the way too.</p>

<p>If I was Anthony Davis or DLo I don&rsquo;t blame them for saying they don&rsquo;t want to be Redicks first failure on his way to he a good coach one day like Kidd is now. Or worse, an anecdote season of further coach firings.</p>

<p>The comments on the first few episodes of Mind the Game were a bunch of hoop heads laughing at Redick for using Xs for (O)ffense and Os for D. he responded in an episode saying <em>WeLl IvE oNlY CoAcHEd 8 yEaR oLdS and it&rsquo;s EaSiEr fOR tHeM!</em> (while EVERY episode LeBron talks out plays and calls opposing bigs the X5 every time)</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s absolutely not ready to be a head coach at college or NBA. I am a longtime Duke and JJ fan since his sophomore season at Duke. But his first stint as a coach will be bumpy</p>

<p>In my armchair phycology opinion he actually seems to have decent self awareness of his arrogance that came from being a top recruit / college player. Which is about as good as you can expect.</p>

      <label for="l7os3vd" class="commentText"><p>That reminds me of a story of meeting him in a grocery store in LA once. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.</p>

<p>He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”</p>

<p>I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.</p>

<p>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.</p>

<p>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>

<p>It just made it look better compared to Stephen A Smith yelling random hot takes at the camera or neutered watered versions of analysis people like Jeff Van Gundy are forced to say on air so they don&rsquo;t scare off viewers (just look how they already neutered Tony Romo).</p>

<p>The fact an NBA team actually seriously considered Reddick is fucking hilarious. It&rsquo;s like Captain Kirk getting hired as head of NASA because he did a great job in Star Trek.</p>

<p>I don’t know if he will be a good coach, but NBA teams hiring processes involve a whole lot more than turning on first take or whatever.</p>

<p>Except the lakers, they suck.</p>

<p>Like, I’ve never listened to or watched JJ’s stuff and thought he was condescending. He’s just confident in what he thinks and he says it.</p>

<p>I think it says more about those people than JJ, in my opinion.</p>

He isn&rsquo;t arrogant so much as comically detail-oriented and particular. You can tell how he became such a great shooter and off-ball player.</p>

<p>I can see him clashing with some players, and those players would probably call him arrogant, but IMO those aren&rsquo;t guys you want on your roster if you can help it.</p>

<p>Most the video is full of him being self deprecating and contributing his wife with her good artistic choices.</p>

<p>And sure, he loves art as well but some people think thag alone is pretentious which is just dumb as hell.</p>

<p>But yeah, this whole post and past ones keep solidifying my opinion that people who can’t deal with someone being confident leads them to think they’re being condescended and talked down to which I just can’t agree with.</p>

      <label for="l7ol9lp" class="commentText"><p>Probably because it’s his podcasts, and we don’t know how he’s like behind the cameras.</p>

<p>But I will say from his podcasts, he argues like a redittor. Or just someone chronically online. He will cherry pick statistics that fit whatever point he’s making (at times, not always) and it’s sort of the thing on here where he’ll site advanced stats and act like it’s the holy grail when it can be a lil more nuanced than that. Kind of like the smart guy that’s gotta remind everyone he’s so smart.</p>

<p>It sometimes does come across as arrogance. For some reason, he seems to always remind us that he played in the NBA. That he played in high level games. That he knows a little bit about what x star is experiencing. And he knows more about that than 99.9% of his listeners, but it’s sort of annoying.</p>

<p>And again, referring to stats or something doesn’t make him arrogant, he’s just stating that he thinks x or y backs up an opinion he has and that’s what he’s sticking to.</p>

<p>If he wasn’t confident in his opinions then everyone would complain he’s wishy washy and has no backbone.</p>

      <label for="l7oof1l" class="commentText"><p>You’ve misread or misinterpreted my comment.</p>

<p>I understand Redick drawing from his playing career to make points. It’s just annoying to reiterate it consistently to some points that don’t require it, and a little weird to try and relate their experience in the NBA to that of a star player, outside of a few things, when JJ was always a role player. A good role player, but not a star.</p>

<p>Referring to stats doesn’t make him arrogant. The manner in which he does it sometimes is. And citing the conclusion you get from a stat as absolute fact, is either arrogant or disingenuous. There’s more to the story than just stats or advanced stats. And often times he will cite some stat and not have any nuance based on that.</p>

<p>There’s nothing be wrong with being confident in your opinion. Nowhere did I say that. But it’s the continous effort to be right or create strawmans to prove his point. Before he even finishes stating his opinion, he immediately states how he knows twitter is gonna disagree, or that there’s stupid arguments on twitter say   x that that is so dumb, and all this shit about NBA twitter.</p>

<p>It’s why I can’t listen to his OM3 podcast consistently.</p>

      <label for="l7oycs2" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with this at all, but have they seen Dan Hurley in action?</p>

<p>Not only does he have zero coaching or playing experience in the NBA, but the way he interacts with his players will 100% not work with professionals.  He&rsquo;s obviously super successful, but so were Urban Meyer and Chip Kelly, both of which had MAJOR issues adapting to coaching rich and famous grown men and not college kids.</p>

<p>JJ has a MUCH better chance of identifying and gaining the respect of NBA players than Dan Hurley does, IMO.</p>

      <label for="l7p044l" class="commentText"><p>A large part of coaching at that level isnt just about the x and os (which JJ certainly understands) it&rsquo;s also about the emotional intelligence and working the refs through players making the minor adjustments when necessary.  Which Ham couldn&rsquo;t do especially late games in the playoffs when Bron was clearly gassed but wouldn&rsquo;t sit.  It opened Soo many back door cuts.  Passed two years they had a championship caliber roster, but needed a kerr or ty lue to get them through the adjustments you&rsquo;d need to make.  </p>

<p>There was the play in game against the pelicans where the Lakers were foul hunting and the refs let them play, so ham told them to match force with force and Zion broke like glass.  When facing the nuggets both years.  Ham got out coached in particular with the rotations he called and an over reliance on James, Davis and dlo.  When it&rsquo;s not working you have to make certain adjustments like draymond lobs and instigation</p>
