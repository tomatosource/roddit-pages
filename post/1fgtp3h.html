</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Lebron is often praised for being the only guy like this and he is definitely the better player and defender relative to CP3.</p>

<p>But Chris Paul deserves more love for being one of the rare guys in league history that can be a really effective high load offensive player while also having a decently strong positive impact defensively. Event though there are guys that are capable of both, often times when there is a massive burden offensively the defense falls apart. Or if they are really great defenders(usually bigs) they don&rsquo;t have the playmaking or efficiency to consistently lead great offenses.</p>

<p>Over the course of his career all kinds of defensive metrics have loved him, even though he is a small guard.</p>

      <label for="ln5n41q" class="commentText"><p>Ehh. Guys like Booker, Sga, and others have spoken highly of him as a good leader. The reason he doesn’t have a ring is because other teams are better and unfortunate luck.</p>

<p>Kobe and MJ has been described as a hard ass and stubborn, and got rings. Guys like Lebron and KD seem more layback with some passive aggressive and succeed. This narrative of a good leader varies no matter what because everyone has their own definition but I definitely wouldn’t attribute it to him not having a ring.</p>

<p>Being well like doesn’t mean a good leader.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best leaders to ever play and guys not wanting to be held accountable doesn&rsquo;t change that. Seriously even if much better and mentally tougher players got fed up with him, he&rsquo;s still massively elevated every team he&rsquo;s ever gone to almost immediately.</p>

      <label for="ln5nzyo" class="commentText"><p>I think his stints in OKC and Phoenix also did a lot to prop up his reputation considering how people thought he was gonna be washed after being traded. One of the best things people overlook about this player empowerment era is that we get to see in real time how good players actually are in a variety of locations and team constructions, which gives us a much more diverse sample to evaluate players strengths and weaknesses. Chris Paul was able to show how big of a floor raiser he was in those two stops.</p>

For instance, a guy like Wade was actually a more dirty player than Chris Paul, but never got that reputation when he played. Wade won a championship pretty early in his career and finals MVP. Even though there was a conspiracy that the refs rigged things for Miami with so many cheap fouls called on the Mavs and Wade was basically living at the free-throw line.</p>

      <label for="ln80l9z" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s obviously the 4 rings, 4 MVPs, and 10 Finals that separate them lol. CP3 is arguably the GOAT ringless player. LeBron is arguably the GOAT, period.</p>

<p>And a lot of that success just boils down to size. CP3 is 6&rsquo;0&rdquo;, LeBron is 6&rsquo;9&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a big man&rsquo;s game. CP3 is great pound-for-pound but he&rsquo;s tiny.</p>

<p>A little guard can&rsquo;t score at the rim like a forward or a big can. A little guard is more likely to be banged up all the time than a forward or a big.</p>

<p>CP3 got hurt in his legacy-defining playoff series (2018 vs Warriors). By the time he finally made the Finals for the first time, he was 35 years old.</p>

<p>He had everything but size. Incredible skills, high IQ, great athlete (underrated, espec before his knee injury), professional public persona.</p>

<p>Injuries and size were his biggest obstacles. I also don’t think he ever had the type of teammates he needed. I always wanted to see him with another group like he had in NO, where he played with a legit tough-guy alpha like David West. Others have pointed out that his best opportunities to break through were just derailed by injuries.</p>

The decision was one of the first times he turned the system on its ear and used it to benefit his own needs while helping people. Instead of letting the networks exploit it for their own benefit (lining their own pockets). And in retaliation, they attacked and abused him to show him this type of behavior wouldn’t be accepted ….because of his talent and hard work he still rose above. For as much praise as he gets, it’s still amazing how undervalued the things he did truly are.</p>

      <label for="ln7b7g7" class="commentText"><p>Chris Paul spent his early years with New Orleans, a dead end for any player. Then almost traded to the Lakers until David Stern screwed up everything and he ended up on the Clippers while inadvertently destroying Lamar Odom’s confidence. Playing with Blake Griffen and the clippers turned out to be a lot like playing with Kawhi Leonard, dude just isn’t on the court enough to make more than a couple runs.</p>

<p>Very talented dude, just never had a reliable supporting cast in his prime.</p>

<p>This feels like an overrated talking point. If he’s an all-time great shouldn’t that be the expectation? If guys like Curry or whoever were also constantly changing teams you’d expect whoever they join to all get better too…..</p>

<p>Chris Paul didn&rsquo;t deal with things like that, and the team stayed remarkably healthy. The CP3 team was also never seen as a threat, just an overperforming likable team. Winning a couple more regular season games doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re better at all</p>

<p>There are endless big names that put up gaudy stats but didn&rsquo;t really effect winning that much.

<p>You can&rsquo;t just brush over it. He did it for an entire career, we&rsquo;ve seen plenty stars join teams and it was disappointing.
Iverson and Melo duo was disappointing, Dwight on Lakers, PG on OKC. CP3 never had that.</p>

<p>Tatum is a jack of all trades player that is elite at just about everything—but not the best at anything. He’s not a premier passer, not premier iso scorer, or a premier defender.</p>

If he makes the jump to All-NBA level defense then sure. He&rsquo;s really good but it needs be elite to compare to the playmaking, efficiency, and consistency of top tier stars. He could also improve his efficiency as a shooter if he doesnt improve defensively.</p>

      <label for="ln6619x" class="commentText"><p>Honestly what’s more impressive IMO is CP3’s longevity as an undersized PG, it’s extremely overlooked.</p>

<p>Not many guys under 6’ tall have decade long careers, let alone nearly 20 years as a top PG. He&rsquo;s not really a “positive defender” this late in his career but it’s truly remarkable he isn’t a “negative defender” like most other undersized guys.</p>

He could have seriously injured Giannis in the valley oop with his push and that&rsquo;s just one example of him playing dangerously when he&rsquo;s losing.  He&rsquo;s a small guy and he definitely uses it to his advantage constantly running in front of bigger players and causing them to trip. Yeah he&rsquo;s one of the best PGs to ever play, but he&rsquo;s also one of my least favorite players ever.</p>

<p>I love CPs game, big fan. I&rsquo;ve never seen a player get knocked off by a rival harder than Curry killed CP3s status and legacy. Crazy. Also just wild how good CP is at the fundamentals of basketball  is, and he still couldn&rsquo;t win a chip. Probably the greatest player of all time without a championship, I&rsquo;m putting him over Chuck.</p>

      <label for="ln7o1dj" class="commentText"><p>Yes Chris Paul, one of the most underrated players of all time, deserves more love. If he was looked at objectively he is simply in the running for the greatest point guard of all time. People hate him so he’s perpetually underrated but he is an all time great.</p>

      <label for="ln85c3f" class="commentText"><p>Caught him on the tail end with his year on the Warriors. My impression of him is that you have to design an entire team around him, given how ball dominant he is. But I do love how he always generates a high quality look. Actually he couldn’t quite do it anymore given his age, but I understood enough from seeing the bursts. But he does also have some insanely bad habits which I didn’t realize until I watched him on my team. Jumping up to pass and constantly getting caught in the air was the biggest one. Another one is an unwillingness to shoot open shots. The guy’s shooting stats are insane over his career, but he seemed to lose confidence by the time he joined us. I’m talking wide open 3s.</p>

Lebrons a high maintenance engine that needs all the new components and stalls a lot unless he is surrounded by the best parts and the finest oil.  CP3s engine isn&rsquo;t proven to be a big winner but is nice.  I&rsquo;d rather have the offensive engine of Duncan, MJ, Kobe, Shaq&hellip;. and they are good defenders during their hayday. Oh, and they don&rsquo;t need all the best components to get the job done.  These guys are more like Chevrolet&hellip; while Lebron and CP3 is Ford and Dodge.</p>
