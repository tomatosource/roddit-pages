</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Lebron is often praised for being the only guy like this and he is definitely the better player and defender relative to CP3.</p>

<p>But Chris Paul deserves more love for being one of the rare guys in league history that can be a really effective high load offensive player while also having a decently strong positive impact defensively. Event though there are guys that are capable of both, often times when there is a massive burden offensively the defense falls apart. Or if they are really great defenders(usually bigs) they don&rsquo;t have the playmaking or efficiency to consistently lead great offenses.</p>

<p>Over the course of his career all kinds of defensive metrics have loved him, even though he is a small guard.</p>

      <label for="ln5n41q" class="commentText"><p>Ehh. Guys like Booker, Sga, and others have spoken highly of him as a good leader. The reason he doesn’t have a ring is because other teams are better and unfortunate luck.</p>

<p>Kobe and MJ has been described as a hard ass and stubborn, and got rings. Guys like Lebron and KD seem more layback with some passive aggressive and succeed. This narrative of a good leader varies no matter what because everyone has their own definition but I definitely wouldn’t attribute it to him not having a ring.</p>

<p>Being well like doesn’t mean a good leader.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best leaders to ever play and guys not wanting to be held accountable doesn&rsquo;t change that. Seriously even if much better and mentally tougher players got fed up with him, he&rsquo;s still massively elevated every team he&rsquo;s ever gone to almost immediately.</p>

One of the best things people overlook about this player empowerment era is that we get to see in real time how good players actually are in a variety of locations and team constructions, which gives us a much more diverse sample to evaluate players strengths and weaknesses. Chris Paul was able to show how big of a floor raiser he was in those two stops.</p>

<p>It’s not that bad. And if you want it to be, I’ll just attribute it to you being a Knicks fan.</p>

<p>I don’t think Chris Paul gets traded because he’s negative. He gets traded because he’s an asset. If he really was negative, he’d be on garbage teams.</p>

<p>This feels like an overrated talking point. If he’s an all-time great shouldn’t that be the expectation? If guys like Curry or whoever were also constantly changing teams you’d expect whoever they join to all get better too…..</p>

<p>WS/48      .152

<p>Now look at the average for Chris Paul&rsquo;s entire freaking career.</p>

<p>WS/48      . 232

<p>If I choose CP3&rsquo;s top 5 seasons he blows Donovan out of the water. </p>

<p>The other 2 players you brought up is Westbrook (amazing player, but also not an all-timer) and Mitchell (not even a top-10 player over the last 5 years, let alone an all-timer). That’s the issue for me with CP3: he is amazing player, better than Westbrook overall, but neither are all-timers. CP3 is not even better than Stockton, who people rarely put in the all-timer conversation.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t just brush over it. He did it for an entire career, we&rsquo;ve seen plenty stars join teams and it was disappointing.
Iverson and Melo duo was disappointing, Dwight on Lakers, PG on OKC. CP3 never had that.</p>

<p>CP3&rsquo;s highest spg in a season, 2.8; Isiah&rsquo;s highest spg, 2.5</p>

<p>CP3&rsquo;s career line: 17.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.1(spg)</p>

<p>Now tbf, CP3&rsquo;s played 6 more season than Isiah but it&rsquo;s still pretty interesting to compare their careers as prototypical 1s.</p>

<p>It’s not an indefensible claim. By the time Steph made his first all-star game, Paul had seven. Their careers overlapped heavily, but their primes less so. CP3 logged about 6-7 years as a consensus Top 3-5 player before Curry joined him. A few years after <em>that</em>, Paul was no longer a Top 5 guy, and after that barely even a Top 15 player.</p>

<p>Not many guys under 6’ tall have decade long careers, let alone nearly 20 years a top PG. he’s not really a “positive defender” this late in his career but it’s truly remarkable he isn’t a “negative defender” like most other undersized guys.</p>

But yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy. He&rsquo;s so involved as a floor general on offense, and then on defense, he was an orchestrated. The dude just leads. It&rsquo;s what he does, and I wanna live everything about it but just wished it could&rsquo;ve won him titles.</p>

<p>Also he is horrible as the president of NBPA for pushing the non-smooth cap increase presumably to pave the way for his own renewal. It fked up the league for a few years and his ring chase, karma dare I say?</p>

Lebrons a high maintenance engine that needs all the new components and stalls a lot unless he is surrounded by the best parts and the finest oil.  CP3s engine isn&rsquo;t proven to be a big winner but is nice.  I&rsquo;d rather have the offensive engine of Duncan, MJ, Kobe, Shaq&hellip;. and they are good defenders during their hayday. Oh, and they don&rsquo;t need all the best components to get the job done.  These guys are more like Chevrolet&hellip; while Lebron and CP3 is Ford and Dodge.</p>
