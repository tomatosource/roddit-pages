<blockquote>
<p>“Adrian really hates to get scooped on shit that should have been his…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>On the Gordon Hayward’s free agency decision getting scooped by Haynes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In 2016, when Gordon Hayward signed with the Celtics. Chris Haynes reports Gordon Hayward is gonna be a Boston Celtic. Adrian Wojnarowski comes out with a report that can only be called ‘retaliatory.’ Mind you, they are both working at the same company [ESPN] at the time. Rather than saying ‘I know there are reports that say he’s going to Boston. I have reports that say he hasn’t made a decision yet,’ but he doesn’t frame it like that. He frames it very clearly like ‘That’s not the correct report. This is the correct report.’ Now everyone behind the scenes knew [Hayward] was going to Boston. It’s done. The angle was one of Woj’s close sources — Mark Bartelstein, head of Priority Sports — represented Gordon Hayward. For whatever reason, whether it was in service to Mark Bartelstein, Gordon Hayward or some other team that thought it was in the mix, Adrian makes this an antagonistic thing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>On the Ben Simmons-James Harden trade getting scooped by Windhorst</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Another example of this was Ben Simmons to Brooklyn. Brian Windhorst — another company colleague to Adrian — says ‘this thing [Harden-Simmons trade] is in the deal zone. We are in the final stages of this deal getting done.’ Again, Adrian has the option to say, ‘My sources are saying something completely different,; they [Philly and Brooklyn] haven’t even spoken to one another.’ But he choses to attack the characterization of any other reporting. Then, what ends up happening? Ben Simmons winds up in Brooklyn within hours of Windhorst telling us they’re in the deal zone and within hours of Adrian saying they haven’t even talked. What’s the connection? Daryl Morey is known to be a source of Adrian: a lot of Daryl Morey news goes out through Adrian.”</p>

<p>“When that stuff happens and it doesn’t go through the way station that is Adrian Wojnarowski, that seems to perturb him even more than the usual ‘I just got scooped because I wasn’t in on it.‘“</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>On the Lakers coaching search reports on JJ Redick and Dan Hurley</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“So we fast forward to this story, and you have a story broken by [Shams], someone he views as direct competition, and he breaks the news that it seems like the Lakers are closing in on a deal with JJ Redick, who is an ESPN colleague to Woj. How would Shams Charania, who works at the Athletic, have the inside scoop on someone that sits at the same company as Woj? Like I said, he doesn’t like to get scooped on shit that should have been his. He takes it very hard. We have a guy in JJ Redick, who — regardless of whether he will take the job or not — does not want to deal with this sort of speculation while he’s covering his first NBA Finals. *So if we’re to assume that Adrian is upset about something he was scooped on, and we also assume JJ — as he told us — would rather this story not be a story, what’s the best way to throw cold water on all of that?*”</p>

<p>Woj took this so hard that he &hellip; reported the correct information that the Lakers were pursuing Hurley, not Redick.</p>

<p>Hilarious that he&rsquo;s trying to spin an incident of Shams being obviously wrong and Woj being obviously correct as an example of Woj being vindictive.</p>
