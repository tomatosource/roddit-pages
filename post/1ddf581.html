<blockquote>
<p>“Adrian really hates to get scooped on shit that should have been his…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>On the Gordon Hayward’s free agency decision getting scooped by Haynes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In 2016, when Gordon Hayward signed with the Celtics. Chris Haynes reports Gordon Hayward is gonna be a Boston Celtic. Adrian Wojnarowski comes out with a report that can only be called ‘retaliatory.’ Mind you, they are both working at the same company [ESPN] at the time. Rather than saying ‘I know there are reports that say he’s going to Boston. I have reports that say he hasn’t made a decision yet,’ but he doesn’t frame it like that. He frames it very clearly like ‘That’s not the correct report. This is the correct report.’ Now everyone behind the scenes knew [Hayward] was going to Boston. It’s done. The angle was one of Woj’s close sources — Mark Bartelstein, head of Priority Sports — represented Gordon Hayward. For whatever reason, whether it was in service to Mark Bartelstein, Gordon Hayward or some other team that thought it was in the mix, Adrian makes this an antagonistic thing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>On the Ben Simmons-James Harden trade getting scooped by Windhorst</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Another example of this was Ben Simmons to Brooklyn. Brian Windhorst — another company colleague to Adrian — says ‘this thing [Harden-Simmons trade] is in the deal zone. We are in the final stages of this deal getting done.’ Again, Adrian has the option to say, ‘My sources are saying something completely different,; they [Philly and Brooklyn] haven’t even spoken to one another.’ But he choses to attack the characterization of any other reporting. Then, what ends up happening? Ben Simmons winds up in Brooklyn within hours of Windhorst telling us they’re in the deal zone and within hours of Adrian saying they haven’t even talked. What’s the connection? Daryl Morey is known to be a source of Adrian: a lot of Daryl Morey news goes out through Adrian.”</p>

<p>“When that stuff happens and it doesn’t go through the way station that is Adrian Wojnarowski, that seems to perturb him even more than the usual ‘I just got scooped because I wasn’t in on it.‘“</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>On the Lakers coaching search reports on JJ Redick and Dan Hurley</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“So we fast forward to this story, and you have a story broken by [Shams], someone he views as direct competition, and he breaks the news that it seems like the Lakers are closing in on a deal with JJ Redick, who is an ESPN colleague to Woj. How would Shams Charania, who works at the Athletic, have the inside scoop on someone that sits at the same company as Woj? Like I said, he doesn’t like to get scooped on shit that should have been his. He takes it very hard. We have a guy in JJ Redick, who — regardless of whether he will take the job or not — does not want to deal with this sort of speculation while he’s covering his first NBA Finals. *So if we’re to assume that Adrian is upset about something he was scooped on, and we also assume JJ — as he told us — would rather this story not be a story, what’s the best way to throw cold water on all of that?*”</p>

<p>Woj took this so hard that he &hellip; reported the correct information that the Lakers were pursuing Hurley, not Redick.</p>

<p>Hilarious that he&rsquo;s trying to spin an incident of Shams being obviously wrong and Woj being obviously correct as an example of Woj being vindictive.</p>

      <label for="l84iexm" class="commentText"><p>Shams was obviously wrong. He didn&rsquo;t just report an introductory meeting.</p>

<p>On June 4, Shams <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5540372/2024/06/04/jj-redick-lakers-head-coach/" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Lakers were &ldquo;zeroing in on JJ Redick as the front-runner to be the franchise’s next head coach&rdquo; and that &ldquo;indications are strong that Redick is their leading choice at this stage.&rdquo; Shams wrote that the Lakers were &ldquo;&lsquo;infatuated&rsquo; with Redick and his potential as a coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shams&rsquo; article says the &ldquo;Lakers’ search has been seriously focused on two candidates — Redick and Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego.&rdquo; Importantly, <em>his article didn&rsquo;t even mention Hurley</em>.</p>

<p>Two days later, Woj <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40289529/sources-lakers-preparing-massive-offer-uconn-dan-hurley" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Lakers have been targeting Hurley since the start of their search and are preparing to offer him a longterm contract.</p>

<p>Woj turned out to be have been correct&ndash;the Lakers offered Hurley a longterm contract.</p>

<p>Shams turned out to be wrong&ndash;Redick was not the frontrunner, and Redick/Borrego were not the two candidates the Lakers had been focused on.</p>

      <label for="l84is0e" class="commentText"><p>based on Fanta&rsquo;s retelling, and this implication by Elhassan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lakers got cold feet about Redick due to his attitude/concerns about personality fit with players</li>
<li>Woj took losing to Shams so hard, that when the Lakers reached out to Woj after they got cold feet about Redick (Fanta <em>thinks</em> the Lakers literally reached out to Woj asking about any other coaching options), Woj realized he could broker the Hurley engagement, who Woj has close family ties to on account of writing a book on Hurley&rsquo;s father</li>
<li>Woj then tells the Lakers that Hurley&rsquo;s mild interest is now more serious interest, launching the Lakers efforts into landing Hurley</li>
<li>Elhassan implies Woj did this primarily to throw cold water on Sham&rsquo;s scoop, Hurley gets wined and dined for a weekend, also helping Hurley reportedly get a better contract from UCONN in the process. win win win</li>

Matter of fact gamblers (degenerate) ones were trying to hammer the Reddick line before it was taken down.</p>

<p>Hurley seemed an oddly timed bombshell. With the increasing scrutiny over LBJ and his influence over LA, people really thought Hurley was going to get Pop and Spo money? No rings, and no NBA experience? Doubt.</p>

<p>This whole thing is crumbling so conveniently for every one.</p>

<p>The hack has always had beef with WOJ. Its personal and best to ignore.</p>

<ul>
<li>Has actual sources</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t use personal bias in a majority of their reporting</li>
<li>Isn&rsquo;t rude, obnoxious, or pretentious when delivering information on air</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately for Amin he fails all three.</p>

You have a specific narrative you want pushed and you have the person who will take what you give them to frame it a certain way. You also need that person to be established enough that it will get the appropriate attention.</p>

<p>I don’t think there are many leakers where a person found out who couldn’t keep their mouth shut anymore.</p>

<p>Not like real-life flat earth conspiracy theories. NBA ones like this or that the Knicks were having a “Civil War” or whatever. He’s kinda hot takes and extremist take just to be edgy.</p>

<p>And his jump shot was so bad it went viral and eroded media/player trust.</p>

<p>just kidding but EDIT: I forgot when he kinda was kinda an axe with woj last offseason. He said basically said &ldquo;Dame to Miami is done, Woj is pretending it&rsquo;s not to carry water for portland. He&rsquo;s lying to carry water for his source the FO in Portland.&rdquo; And then Woj was right and he never brought it up again that I saw.</p>
