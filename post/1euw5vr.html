      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1euw5vr/the_real_big_news_of_goran_dragics_farewell_chris/"><p>The real big news of Goran Dragic&rsquo;s farewell:  Chris Bosh has been cleared to play and thus gets to hit the court one last time.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Whereas Wade&rsquo;s knees gave way to a sudden decline and LeBron has seemingly escaped the concept of aging, the 3rd member of the Heatles, Chris Bosh, had a very abrupt end to their career despite having some very productive seasons post-Heatles, averaging 20.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3 across two seasons post-LeHeat before the NBA ruled his ongoing bout with blood clots were career-ending in 2017.</p>

<p>Fun fact:  The remainder of Chris Bosh&rsquo;s contract - roughly $52 million - was paid in deferrals from that ruling up until 2022.</p>

<p>The 11x All-Star and 2x NBA champion tried to return to the court from 2017 onward after the Heat waived him but was unable to go out on his own terms, officially retiring in 2019.  Ironically, this was the same year the team that drafted him in 2003, the Toronto Raptors, won their first and only championship.</p>

<p>Chris Bosh was recently medically cleared to play and is amongst the many players expected to play in Goran Dragic&rsquo;s &ldquo;farewell game&rdquo;, a game which doubly serves as a final farewell to the oft-underappreciated third Heatle.</p>

<p>What I was sad about after he left, is not seeing how he could&rsquo;ve continued to develop as a star player.  He really carried the Raps that final season, pushing up his scoring load with with career high TS% and USG%.  His style was unique compared to the other better PFs.  He was really dangerous in the triple threat because he had not only an excellent jumper, but the ability to blow by into the lane (.500+ FTR).  That game got abandoned in Miami during his prime years, and his evolution was in focusing his contributions to those of a role player.</p>

<p>That final season where he made an agreement to join Wade and Lebron at the All-Star Game, didn&rsquo;t tell anyone in management, had a worse second half and was &ldquo;injured&rdquo; the last five games of the season as Toronto missed the playoffs by one game? I think you and I remember 2010 differently.</p>

<p>The smartest thing Bosh did was not release that documentary he was making during the offseason.</p>

      <label for="liqf9z8" class="commentText"><p>Yea its really sad the way his career ended but people have gone completely off the deep end with bosh&rsquo;s career in hindsight.  He was a solid star for a really bad team and then got routinely worse every year with the heatles.  They were constantly looking for interior help because bosh was shrinking as each year passed.  He was down to 6 rebounds a game at the end.  Birdman and battier were the better options many nights for them against good teams.  I hate how people forget all this and pretend like he was even close to all-nba level</p>

<p>Yeah people forget but Wade had 2 sudden dips in level, one in 2011 (when he stopped being elite) and one in 2013 (when he stopped being a star). Bosh was consistent af throughout though.</p>

<p>He would immediately become the oldest player in the league if he played (current oldest is LeBron) and hasn’t played in like 7+ years</p>

<p>I was just wondering if maybe something had changed with regards to treatment or research or medicine, since Bosh has been out for years and now he’s cleared the same year Koloko gets cleared.</p>

<p>But yeah, even if they had the exact same disorder their treatment would tailored towards their own specific health needs, goes without saying.</p>

But some people can transiently develop blood clotting disorders, they develop certain antibodies that shouldn’t normally exist (lupus anticoagulant) etc. but then you test them like a decade later and they don’t have these antibodies any longer. And maybe a specialist doctor (a haematologist) can make the call that their blood clot risk has gone back to that of the normal population. 
Am not a haematologist tho </p>

Was going to be a superstar and better player than him. So to Luka who watched him and be mentored by him, it means alot to him</p>

      <label for="liog59t" class="commentText"><p>I mean I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s potential health concerns that would arise from bringing back the &ldquo;NBA Legends&rdquo; game given a lot of these guys are in their 50s and they are not in the same condition they were when they played in the NBA.  Injuries were the main reason why it got canned to begin with and if the NBA wasn&rsquo;t willing to bring it back for the 75th anniversary, I can&rsquo;t imagine that would change for the next few years.</p>

He never really fit in with the egos of the heat back then. He is a normal family guy who just happens to be a very large freak athlete. It almost seemed like a curse to have his body and his personality matched together. Such a great dude.</p>
