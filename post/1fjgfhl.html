<p>I was just looking at NBA team stats and found this interesting.</p>

<p>While the top teams had 20 - 23 (24%) wide open 3PAs,  the Bottom teams only had about 17 - 14 (17%) wide open 3PAs.</p>

<p>AG never shot any and Jokic shot a few.</p>

<p>Jamal doesnt tske too many open looks in general due to his role on the team and the bench didnt add much to that.</p>

<p>Braum didnt take many 3s in general and Reggie was probably the main contributor from the bench when it comes to this and even then its the bench.</p>

<p>This leaves really MPJ and KCP as the guys that were designated to get those open looks and in reality KCPs volume wasnt even super high.</p>

      <label for="lnoccbf" class="commentText"><p>Most of Jokic&rsquo;s passes are for easy layups as opposed to 3s. I remember a stat from a Thinking Basketball that essentially laid out the numbers that around 70% of Jokic&rsquo;s assists were for layups or dunks compared to only around 40% for say Haliburton who preferred kicking out to the 3pt line. The Nuggets and the Pacers generated around the same PPP on offense overall, just with a far different shot diet. There can be a debate on which offense is more sustainable overall or translates better in the playoffs, but Denver being low is not too surprising considering the fact that they don&rsquo;t shoot a lot of 3s, and that their best 3pt shooter (MPJ) is the king of shooting the ball no matter how tight the defense on him is.</p>

<p>This brings up a related topic, that how &lsquo;open&rsquo; a player is based on distance doesn&rsquo;t actually give you a ton of information except for extreme examples on jumpers. I&rsquo;m going to be using Aaron Gordon as an example because I&rsquo;m most familiar with how the Nuggets operate. AG  absolutely abuses mismatches for easy over-the-defender entry passes near the rim, and also is an excellent backdoor cutter from the dunker&rsquo;s spot. Both of these plays regularly generate extremely high percentage shots for the Nuggets offense, despite there almost always being either a nearby help defender, or an actual jumping contest on the dunk from said help defender. These shots would be listed as tight or very tight defense despite them being an incredibly efficient shot off of either a mismatch or a defensive breakdown.</p>

      <label for="lnoaad1" class="commentText"><p>To really make this valuable, you should provide the % of wide open 3 point attempts divided by total 3 point attempts. That illustrates how good a team is at generating wide open 3 point looks. The stat you shared doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>OKC: 22.5 wide open 3FGA, 34.2 total 3FGA = 66% wide open</p>

<p>Dallas: 17.8 wide open 3FGA, 39.5 total 3FGA = 45% wide open</p>

<p>Dallas seems to be pretty darn bad at generating open 3 pointers, but Luka launches so many contested threes, that it may skew their stats a lot.</p>

<p>Anyway: look for wide open %, not volume.</p>

      <label for="lnoul0u" class="commentText"><p>I saw a comment you had elsewhere in the thread about stretch 5s. My problem is with the lack of 3s in general, not necessarily the wide open ones. Though 11th definitely shows the gravity the big 3 were able to create.</p>

<p>We had no semblance of a stretch five on our team save for very rare stretches with KD there. And to compound that, our big couldn’t finish at the rim either so it’s not like he added any rim pressure. A combination of a stretch five, and more health for Beal who was a walking paint touch could’ve greatly improved the offense last year with the amount of shooting they had available to them. I think they could’ve gotten a lot more 3s up just by swapping one of the bigs.</p>

<p>This years roster is a little different, but still no stretch 5 unless you buy Nurks empty gym footage. Still it will be interesting to see what Bud and Tyus can do with the offense. Bud transformed Brook, hopefully we get lucky and he can do it twice.</p>
