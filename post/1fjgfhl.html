<p>I was just looking at NBA team stats and found this interesting.</p>

<p>While the top teams had 20 - 23 (24%) wide open 3PAs,  the Bottom teams only had about 17 - 14 (17%) wide open 3PAs.</p>

      <label for="lno2uhj" class="commentText"><p>Cause the Nuggets are one of the bottom teams in the league when it comes to 3 point shooting in general.</p>

<p>AG never shot any and Jokic shot a few.</p>

<p>Jamal doesnt tske too many open looks in general due to his role on the team and the bench didnt add much to that.</p>

<p>Braum didnt take many 3s in general and Reggie was probably the main contributor from the bench when it comes to this and even then its the bench.</p>

<p>This leaves really MPJ and KCP as the guys that were designated to get those open looks and in reality KCPs volume wasnt even super high.</p>

Now at 4-6 feet open, OKC &amp; IND are in the bottom pack it seems while BOS &amp; DAL are the top teams.</p>

      <label for="lnoccbf" class="commentText"><p>Most of Jokic&rsquo;s passes are for easy layups as opposed to 3s. I remember a stat from a Thinking Basketball that essentially laid out the numbers that around 70% of Jokic&rsquo;s assists were for layups or dunks compared to only around 40% for say Haliburton who preferred kicking out to the 3pt line. The Nuggets and the Pacers generated around the same PPP on offense overall, just with a far different shot diet. There can be a debate on which offense is more sustainable overall or translates better in the playoffs, but Denver being low is not too surprising considering the fact that they don&rsquo;t shoot a lot of 3s, and that their best 3pt shooter (MPJ) is the king of shooting the ball no matter how tight the defense on him is.</p>

<p><strong>Very tight</strong> (0-2 ft) is barely worth mentioning, because no team shot more than 0.4 attempts per game:</p>

<p>Clippers 42.9% (5th in league), Lakers 37.5% (tied for 7th)</p>

<p><strong>Overall 3pt percentage</strong>:</p>

<p>Clippers 38.1% (6th in league), Lakers 37.7% (8th).</p>

<hr>

<p>Comparing this to IND and OKC, the teams that shot the most open 3&rsquo;s - OKC shot 29.1% on 1.4 attempts, and IND shot 29.4% on 1.9 attempts.</p>

<p>tl;dr - The Clippers took <em>a lot</em> of tightly defended 3s and made them at a rate good for 12th place in the league on <em>all</em> 3pt attempts, regardless of defender position.</p>

      <label for="lnoaad1" class="commentText"><p>To really make this valuable, you should provide the % of wide open 3 point attempts divided by total 3 point attempts. That illustrates how good a team is at generating wide open 3 point looks. The stat you shared doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>OKC: 22.5 wide open 3FGA, 34.2 total 3FGA = 66% wide open</p>

<p>Dallas: 17.8 wide open 3FGA, 39.5 total 3FGA = 45% wide open</p>

<p>Dallas seems to be pretty darn bad at generating open 3 pointers, but Luka launches so many contested threes, that it may skew their stats a lot.</p>

<p>Anyway: look for wide open %, not volume.</p>
