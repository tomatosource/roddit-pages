</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5729821/2024/08/29/jayson-tatum-team-usa-benching-boston-celtics/?source=user_shared_article&amp;utm_content=buffer8bd29&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some things never change for Jayson Tatum. As his career has continued to ebb and flow, there has been one constant: Tatum finds himself at the center of conversation.</p>

<p>He broke onto the NBA scene as an impressive role player when he was 19, only to oscillate in the public eye between auspicious and overhyped. Leading the Boston Celtics to a title in June gave him a championship pass, a final word to put questions of his stardom to bed</p>

<p>.But it took just a few weeks for the conversation to start again. This time, the tenor was different. As a member of Team USA, Tatum (alongside Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton) didn’t make it off the bench in the Olympics opener against Serbia. Though Tatum played in four of the other five games — he sat again against Serbia in the semifinals — his benching became one of the talking points of the tournament.</p>

<p>“It’s one of those things where there’s been so much talk and debate,” Tatum said*.* “There was a period of is he a superstar or not? Then it was a big debate, like, is he championship ready now? Then it’s like how could he not get in the (Olympics)? I’m like, I just won a championship, it’s the summertime, it might be nice to have a little break where you don’t turn on ESPN and they’re talking about you. But I guess this is part of it, and that may be the level that I’ve reached now in my career.”</p>

<p>Even though he was in the Olympic Village and avoided discussing it publicly while the Games were still going, Tatum was aware of what was happening outside of Paris. And while this was one of the rare times in which the public seemed to have his back, it still wasn’t easy for him.</p>

<p>“It was a lot. In the age of social media, you see everything,” Tatum said during a phone call. “You see all the tweets and the people on the podcasts and people on TV giving their opinion on whether they thought it was a good decision or it was an outrageous decision or whatever. Obviously, I wanted to contribute more, and I’ve never been in (this) situation. I started playing basketball at (age) 3 at the YMCA, and I’ve never not played, so it was different and it was challenging.”</p>

<p>‘Man, I can only just imagine what he’s going through,&lsquo;” Holiday said*.* “I feel like he enjoyed himself and I feel like that’s a part of the experience, is enjoying it. I hope he got a chance to (enjoy) it, because I did. It’s fun to play with him and (Derrick) White, but then it’s also fun to play with some of the best players ever.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t moping around. I didn’t have an attitude. I wasn’t angry at the world,” Tatum said. “I stayed ready and did what was asked of me and I won a gold medal, right?”</p>

<p>“I know I didn’t make a jump shot when I was with Team USA. I don’t know, law of averages,” Tatum said. “It’s a weird rhythm thing being with Team USA; you never exactly know when you’re gonna get the ball. But that’s part of it. You sign up for that because I’ve done it before (at the Tokyo Games).”</p>

<p>Tatum and those around him have maintained he is not injured and hasn’t lost confidence in his shot. Though he shot 28.3 percent from deep in the playoffs and missed every jumper he took while on Team USA, he said he’s been playing basketball long enough that he’s not worried about getting back on track by October.</p>

<p>“I have two (gold medals) now, I have a championship, and everything doesn’t necessarily go the way you expect it to go, right?” Tatum said. “I’ve learned to be like, ‘OK, that’s a part of it.’ You move on, and I’m getting ready to enjoy the last little weeks I have before the season starts and get ready for another season.”</p>

      <label for="lkiteg0" class="commentText"><p>Being in Boston (Boston wins all the damn time in sports), being the best player on the team so talked about the most, Celtics winning a lot (most playoff wins since he came into the league), casuals just tuning in for the finals where he played really poorly in 2022 probably caused some push back of “this guy? This guy is who people say is a superstar?” Plus the Kobe text and then not playing well came across as ego</p>

<p>People have been on the hate train since then. They’ve been the favorites the last 2 years and people just love an underdog story. People want to see Ant Edwards succeed, or Jimmy Butler lead an 8 seed to the finals, or Kawhi take down Golden State because they’re entertained by the unpredictability.</p>

<p>Golden State was a really fun story when they won in 2015, and Kevin Durant was one of the most beloved players in the league. Then when he joined them they became the evil empire and people didn’t want them to win.</p>

<p>It’s like how Tom Brady wasn’t the most athletic guy and couldn’t run and didn’t have uber athletic receivers and through his early success people started to call him a system QB, Peyton Manning was better, Rodgers was better, fans celebrated when the Giants took them down</p>

<p>Tatum is getting a similar thing where I obviously don’t expect him to end up as the GOAT but getting called a role player or the MJ of Tobias Harris’ feels similar. People just don’t want to see Tatum and the Celtics run the league for the next 2-3 years and form a dynasty and be in talks with the other teams that have done that because they don’t believe he’s that kind of player or earned that legend status.</p>

<p>If you watched no basketball except the playoffs and saw Harden, Embiid, Chris Paul and Westbrook fail multiple times as favorites, while Luka, Jimmy Butler, Haliburton, and LeBron take 5-8 seeds to the conference finals in recent years, the hate starts to make a lot more sense.</p>

      <label for="lkirsqh" class="commentText"><p>Sports is an escape for a lot of people. For some, it&rsquo;s entertainment that they enjoy. For many others, it seems to just be an outlet to express anger or insecurities from some other part of their life. When I see people get enraged by missed shots, or just be relentless in tearing down a player, I always just wonder what shitty stuff in their life they are actually upset about. It&rsquo;s basically just a lamer, adult version of grade school bullying behavior.</p>

      <label for="lkixnwk" class="commentText"><p>There’s also a huge amount of young people on social media who would do anything for likes/upvotes. Hating gets a lot of attention and it’s hilarious to some no matter if the take is true or not. It quickly became &lsquo;who can makes the best joke on the easy target’ contest and it gives me high school vibe tbh.</p>

<p>And it’s everywhere on social media (Reddit, Twitter, IG, Tik Tok). It’s the stan culture mixed with the troll culture.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m saying it gotta be hard for the nba stars of the new generation because they’re also on social media. Being the butt of the jokes every time you open an app gotta be tough</p>

<p>“I know I didn’t make a jump shot when I was with Team USA. I don’t know, law of averages,” Tatum said. “It’s a weird rhythm thing being with Team USA; you never exactly know when you’re gonna get the ball. But that’s part of it. You sign up for that because I’ve done it before (at the Tokyo Games).”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this right here is why he saw very little play time. You can&rsquo;t just throw a star that&rsquo;s used to playing 35+ minutes into the middle of a game and expect them to produce exactly the same. Especially when he&rsquo;s playing with all new players in a new system and a significantly reduced role.</p>

<p>Celtics had the easiest fucking schedule while it&rsquo;s a bloodbath in the West, while also having by far the best roster and supporting cast.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t pretend Tatum didn&rsquo;t have it easy this run, delulu Celtics fans just not willing to take the L that their boy got benched when it mattered the most on the biggest stage. Dude didn&rsquo;t even get finals MVP, isn&rsquo;t that obvious he chokes?</p>

<p>Shai averaged 32/8/7 on 60 TS against the Mavs while facing double and triple teams. Tatum averaged 22/8/7 on 50 TS.</p>

<p>Better than Tatum and can’t make it out of the first round with AD as his second option? Don’t you feel embarrassed with that take? Obviously not as humiliating as watching  PJ Washington creampie your team but probably fairly close right?</p>

<p>Well when you double Tatum he passes to his wide open teammate. How come KD couldn’t do that? He did have a 50/40/90 point guard+elite shooter patty mills to dish to right?</p>

<p>Which defender primarily guarded KD?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>double teams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can’t hit an open guy when you’re doubled that’s a skill issue. Nobody gives embiid or Jaylen brown a pass for it, so I don’t see why KD should get one here.</p>

<p>Sorry but Tatum gets doubled too and he doesn’t have kyrie Irving as a safety valve either. He still figures it out (which is what prevents people from doubling him).</p>

<p>Despite that, when he was 1-1 with Tatum, it was not pretty for KD.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 games</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can’t blame tstum for KD sucking shit so badly that he got swept. He should have played better so that we’d have 7 games instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 years ago</p>

<p>Well tstum got better and KD got worse so not sure how that helps you here.</p>

<p>Lebron had AD as his number 2 option and got gentleman swept. He would have given up 40 points a game with his usual lazy defense, we would have lost in like the second round, and then his 70iq fanbase would have blamed jrue Holliday for being a playoff dropper and would have brought up his bucks shooting stats as proof.</p>

<p>If he was half as good as lakers fans think he is, the lakers wouldn’t be as bad as they are.</p>

<p>You’re just mad that we got Kobe without the rape.   It’s obviously rough when your biggest rival has a superstar and you’re stuck with a washed up guy who’s main concern is statpadding at this point in his career, but that’s life.</p>

      <label for="lkieos7" class="commentText"><p>The things I found interesting was the claim that he doesn’t have any lingering wrist injury. This has been one of the three prevailing theories in the Celtics subreddit, the other being he got too jacked, and the 3rd is he’s just on a bad cold streak…</p>

<p>FOR MY STATS/MATH PEOPLE………. if Tatum is actually just on a terrible shooting streak he should shoot above his average????? I think that’s how that works. What would his averages look like if the slump fixes itself?</p>

      <label for="lkipb0k" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s not injured, and muscle destroying your shot is a giant myth.  People need to get over the dumb conspiracies - he literally just shot 38% from deep last season on over 600 attempts.  He actually shot 41% from deep post All-Star break.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not even a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cold streak, it&rsquo;s just a cold streak that happened in a very public timeframe.  19 games and a handful of Olympics shots.  Barely more than a month&rsquo;s worth of basketball.  Even Steph Curry has had some awful shooting months.</p>

<p>The 3-point shot is notoriously erratic so not really sure what you&rsquo;re getting at.  I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s probably about a natural 38% 3-point shooter, but up to +/- 3% in either direction in any season is totally standard.</p>
