</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5729821/2024/08/29/jayson-tatum-team-usa-benching-boston-celtics/?source=user_shared_article&amp;utm_content=buffer8bd29&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some things never change for Jayson Tatum. As his career has continued to ebb and flow, there has been one constant: Tatum finds himself at the center of conversation.</p>

<p>He broke onto the NBA scene as an impressive role player when he was 19, only to oscillate in the public eye between auspicious and overhyped. Leading the Boston Celtics to a title in June gave him a championship pass, a final word to put questions of his stardom to bed</p>

<p>.But it took just a few weeks for the conversation to start again. This time, the tenor was different. As a member of Team USA, Tatum (alongside Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton) didn’t make it off the bench in the Olympics opener against Serbia. Though Tatum played in four of the other five games — he sat again against Serbia in the semifinals — his benching became one of the talking points of the tournament.</p>

<p>“It’s one of those things where there’s been so much talk and debate,” Tatum said*.* “There was a period of is he a superstar or not? Then it was a big debate, like, is he championship ready now? Then it’s like how could he not get in the (Olympics)? I’m like, I just won a championship, it’s the summertime, it might be nice to have a little break where you don’t turn on ESPN and they’re talking about you. But I guess this is part of it, and that may be the level that I’ve reached now in my career.”</p>

<p>Even though he was in the Olympic Village and avoided discussing it publicly while the Games were still going, Tatum was aware of what was happening outside of Paris. And while this was one of the rare times in which the public seemed to have his back, it still wasn’t easy for him.</p>

<p>“It was a lot. In the age of social media, you see everything,” Tatum said during a phone call. “You see all the tweets and the people on the podcasts and people on TV giving their opinion on whether they thought it was a good decision or it was an outrageous decision or whatever. Obviously, I wanted to contribute more, and I’ve never been in (this) situation. I started playing basketball at (age) 3 at the YMCA, and I’ve never not played, so it was different and it was challenging.”</p>

<p>‘Man, I can only just imagine what he’s going through,&lsquo;” Holiday said*.* “I feel like he enjoyed himself and I feel like that’s a part of the experience, is enjoying it. I hope he got a chance to (enjoy) it, because I did. It’s fun to play with him and (Derrick) White, but then it’s also fun to play with some of the best players ever.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t moping around. I didn’t have an attitude. I wasn’t angry at the world,” Tatum said. “I stayed ready and did what was asked of me and I won a gold medal, right?”</p>

<p>“I know I didn’t make a jump shot when I was with Team USA. I don’t know, law of averages,” Tatum said. “It’s a weird rhythm thing being with Team USA; you never exactly know when you’re gonna get the ball. But that’s part of it. You sign up for that because I’ve done it before (at the Tokyo Games).”</p>

<p>Tatum and those around him have maintained he is not injured and hasn’t lost confidence in his shot. Though he shot 28.3 percent from deep in the playoffs and missed every jumper he took while on Team USA, he said he’s been playing basketball long enough that he’s not worried about getting back on track by October.</p>

<p>“I have two (gold medals) now, I have a championship, and everything doesn’t necessarily go the way you expect it to go, right?” Tatum said. “I’ve learned to be like, ‘OK, that’s a part of it.’ You move on, and I’m getting ready to enjoy the last little weeks I have before the season starts and get ready for another season.”</p>

      <label for="lkkdlyz" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;ll get his turn. But for now, he was pretty much playing behind LBJ and KD who are still very near the heights of their powers. He could probably play next to them, but Kerr looked to have them on the court together or Booker who was pretty much perfect in his role and then Bam and AD.</p>

<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t mind when people say they hate the Celtics. Honestly, I get it. Just don&rsquo;t act like that&rsquo;s not the reason for it when it obviously is, because there&rsquo;s nothing about his public image that justifies the weird vitriol some people have for him</p>

      <label for="lkirsqh" class="commentText"><p>Sports is an escape for a lot of people. For some, it&rsquo;s entertainment that they enjoy. For many others, it seems to just be an outlet to express anger or insecurities from some other part of their life. When I see people get enraged by missed shots, or just be relentless in tearing down a player, I always just wonder what shitty stuff in their life they are actually upset about. It&rsquo;s basically just a lamer, adult version of grade school bullying behavior.</p>

      <label for="lkixnwk" class="commentText"><p>There’s also a huge amount of young people on social media who would do anything for likes/upvotes. Hating gets a lot of attention and it’s hilarious to some no matter if the take is true or not. It quickly became &lsquo;who can makes the best joke on the easy target’ contest and it gives me high school vibe tbh.</p>

<p>And it’s everywhere on social media (Reddit, Twitter, IG, Tik Tok). It’s the stan culture mixed with the troll culture.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m saying it gotta be hard for the nba stars of the new generation because they’re also on social media. Being the butt of the jokes every time you open an app gotta be tough</p>

<p>The man is inarguably one of the best players in the NBA. But people trying to move him from 5th best to 15th best want to make him seem like he&rsquo;s a hack.</p>

      <label for="lkj8a94" class="commentText"><p>Thing is he doesn’t play hero ball and make himself the primary scorer, he’s more into facilitating and playmaking, which is why the top 5 claims make no sense to a lot of fans. Like he rarely goes full TMac or Kobe during a win.</p>

<p>That’s why all the “he’s a role player” slander comes from.</p>

<p>He shot like shit in the ECF and finals but he still made up for it in different ways. He most definitely has an argument for top 5, it’s just he’s in a shooting slump now</p>

<p>Like there&rsquo;s this clip on Twitter of a guy who came back with two drinks, looked like he was gonna give one to the girl beside him but she got it from someone behind and how he&rsquo;s stuck with 2 glasses. Everyone is making jokes about how he&rsquo;s been rejected whereas legit 2 seconds later in the same clip she gives the glass she was holding to the woman beside her and takes his glass. </p>

      <label for="lkiteg0" class="commentText"><p>Being in Boston (Boston wins all the damn time in sports), being the best player on the team so talked about the most, Celtics winning a lot (most playoff wins since he came into the league), casuals just tuning in for the finals where he played really poorly in 2022 probably caused some push back of “this guy? This guy is who people say is a superstar?” Plus the Kobe text and then not playing well came across as ego</p>

<p>People have been on the hate train since then. They’ve been the favorites the last 2 years and people just love an underdog story. People want to see Ant Edwards succeed, or Jimmy Butler lead an 8 seed to the finals, or Kawhi take down Golden State because they’re entertained by the unpredictability.</p>

<p>Golden State was a really fun story when they won in 2015, and Kevin Durant was one of the most beloved players in the league. Then when he joined them they became the evil empire and people didn’t want them to win.</p>

<p>It’s like how Tom Brady wasn’t the most athletic guy and couldn’t run and didn’t have uber athletic receivers and through his early success people started to call him a system QB, Peyton Manning was better, Rodgers was better, fans celebrated when the Giants took them down</p>

<p>Tatum is getting a similar thing where I obviously don’t expect him to end up as the GOAT but getting called a role player or the MJ of Tobias Harris’ feels similar. People just don’t want to see Tatum and the Celtics run the league for the next 2-3 years and form a dynasty and be in talks with the other teams that have done that because they don’t believe he’s that kind of player or earned that legend status.</p>

<p>If you watched no basketball except the playoffs and saw Harden, Embiid, Chris Paul and Westbrook fail multiple times as favorites, while Luka, Jimmy Butler, Haliburton, and LeBron take 5-8 seeds to the conference finals in recent years, the hate starts to make a lot more sense.</p>

      <label for="lkjn2eq" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; and people aren&rsquo;t ready to have that conversation yet.</p>

<p>Dallas fans like to compare Doncic to Tatum.</p>

<p>Minnesota fans like to compare Edwards to Tatum.</p>

<p>Oklahoma fans like to compare SGA to Tatum.</p>

<p>Phoenix fans like to compare Booker to Tatum.</p>

<p>etc. etc.</p>

<p>Everyone else likes to put someone else up as their version of &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; but Jayson Tatum is the benchmark all those guys are compared against. He&rsquo;s the gold standard when we&rsquo;re talking about successful young players in the NBA.</p>

<p>And we know this because it&rsquo;s been this way for nearly 7 years now.</p>

<p>It used to be Philadephia fans, Toronto fans and LA fans used to like comparing Simmons, Siakam and Kuzma/Ingram to Tatum. But you never used to see really volatile Simmons vs Siakam debates for example.</p>

<p>the &ldquo;smallest bouts&rdquo; you&rsquo;re talking about are people discrediting his entire body of work and putting it down to teammates, all of who were trashed even harder than he was until it came time to shit on him</p>

      <label for="lkj594l" class="commentText"><p>I mean, I think he was clearly upset (&ldquo;I started playing basketball at (age) 3 at the YMCA, and I’ve never not played, so it was different and it was challenging.”) but he seems to be content moving on and focusing on next season rather than moping and sending passive-aggressive tweets and vague Instagram posts.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s very Brady-esque in this way back when the Pats went through a bunch of seasons getting knocked out of the playoffs before Super Bowl 49. No matter the outcome, the attitude was always &ldquo;focus on the next play, next game, next season,&rdquo; not on the past, and find ways to be better. It&rsquo;s a kind of mental toughness and resilience that&rsquo;s (imo) very underrated and a useful life skill.</p>

      <label for="lkj6c5a" class="commentText"><p>Is an important part of a conference finals run as a rookie, all nba in his third year, him and his Co star survive trade rumours through scrutiny and win a chip all while signing a max, getting a 2k cover, guaranteed all star every year, two 50pt playoff games by age 26, indisputably top 10 player in the league since 2022.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not talking to you - I&rsquo;m sure as a celtics fan you know all of this. But others should really understand how successful this guy has been and that since 2017, aside from Luka, there isn&rsquo;t another player to have achieved as much (that&rsquo;s win on the court plus individual accolades plus fame and recognition, on the court obv Tatum achieved more on the court but that is also dependant on team).</p>

      <label for="lkjdhph" class="commentText"><p>i mean, clearly the guy cares about winning, and it&rsquo;s not like there wasn&rsquo;t plenty of playoff heartbreak en route to last year&rsquo;s championship</p>

<p>like, on an individual level, sure, Tatum&rsquo;s career has been mostly up with very little down (really just that mess of a sophomore year, plus that one year he got COVID). but as a team there&rsquo;s been a lot of deep playoff runs that didn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> make it all the way, that&rsquo;s gotta take some kind of toll</p>

<p>“I know I didn’t make a jump shot when I was with Team USA. I don’t know, law of averages,” Tatum said. “It’s a weird rhythm thing being with Team USA; you never exactly know when you’re gonna get the ball. But that’s part of it. You sign up for that because I’ve done it before (at the Tokyo Games).”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this right here is why he saw very little play time. You can&rsquo;t just throw a star that&rsquo;s used to playing 35+ minutes into the middle of a game and expect them to produce exactly the same. Especially when he&rsquo;s playing with all new players in a new system and a significantly reduced role.</p>

<p>Better than Tatum and can’t make it out of the first round with AD as his second option? Don’t you feel embarrassed with that take? Obviously not as humiliating as watching  PJ Washington creampie your team but probably fairly close right?</p>

I guess I get Tatum fans being mad (like his family or whoever), but Celtics fans? Be glad your star got some rest after a longgg playoff run</p>

One of the biggest being Stephen A smith who obviously has the most popular sports debate show and now a podcast where he also talked about it. There were others as well but I don’t think most Celtics fans cared tbh. He’s been playing pretty much non stop basketball for the past few years between Fiba, the Tokyo Olympics, annual long playoff runs</p>

<p>You had 4 Forwards. Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Anthony Davis and Jayson Tatum.</p>

<p>You have 40 minutes in a FIBA game.</p>

<p>It’s not even a complicated math problem - every other forward on the team is better than Tatum.</p>

Could have easily switched Booker for Tatum. Then you&rsquo;d still have Jrue left for defense on the perimiter and Curry for his off ball movement.</p>

This has been one of the three prevailing theories in the Celtics subreddit, the other being he got too jacked, and the 3rd is he’s just on a bad cold streak…</p>

<p>FOR MY STATS/MATH PEOPLE………. if Tatum is actually just on a terrible shooting streak he should shoot above his average????? I think that’s how that works. What would his averages look like if the slump fixes itself?</p>

      <label for="lkipb0k" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s not injured, and muscle destroying your shot is a giant myth.  People need to get over the dumb conspiracies - he literally just shot 38% from deep last season on over 600 attempts.  He actually shot 41% from deep post All-Star break.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not even a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cold streak, it&rsquo;s just a cold streak that happened in a very public timeframe.  19 games and a handful of Olympics shots.  Barely more than a month&rsquo;s worth of basketball.  Even Steph Curry has had some awful shooting months.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The 3-point shot is notoriously erratic so not really sure what you&rsquo;re getting at.  I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s probably about a natural 38% 3-point shooter, but up to +/- 3% in either direction in any season is totally standard.</p>
