</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5729821/2024/08/29/jayson-tatum-team-usa-benching-boston-celtics/?source=user_shared_article&amp;utm_content=buffer8bd29&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some things never change for Jayson Tatum. As his career has continued to ebb and flow, there has been one constant: Tatum finds himself at the center of conversation.</p>

<p>He broke onto the NBA scene as an impressive role player when he was 19, only to oscillate in the public eye between auspicious and overhyped. Leading the Boston Celtics to a title in June gave him a championship pass, a final word to put questions of his stardom to bed</p>

<p>.But it took just a few weeks for the conversation to start again. This time, the tenor was different. As a member of Team USA, Tatum (alongside Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton) didn’t make it off the bench in the Olympics opener against Serbia. Though Tatum played in four of the other five games — he sat again against Serbia in the semifinals — his benching became one of the talking points of the tournament.</p>

<p>“It’s one of those things where there’s been so much talk and debate,” Tatum said*.* “There was a period of is he a superstar or not? Then it was a big debate, like, is he championship ready now? Then it’s like how could he not get in the (Olympics)? I’m like, I just won a championship, it’s the summertime, it might be nice to have a little break where you don’t turn on ESPN and they’re talking about you. But I guess this is part of it, and that may be the level that I’ve reached now in my career.”</p>

<p>Even though he was in the Olympic Village and avoided discussing it publicly while the Games were still going, Tatum was aware of what was happening outside of Paris. And while this was one of the rare times in which the public seemed to have his back, it still wasn’t easy for him.</p>

<p>“It was a lot. In the age of social media, you see everything,” Tatum said during a phone call. “You see all the tweets and the people on the podcasts and people on TV giving their opinion on whether they thought it was a good decision or it was an outrageous decision or whatever. Obviously, I wanted to contribute more, and I’ve never been in (this) situation. I started playing basketball at (age) 3 at the YMCA, and I’ve never not played, so it was different and it was challenging.”</p>

<p>‘Man, I can only just imagine what he’s going through,&lsquo;” Holiday said*.* “I feel like he enjoyed himself and I feel like that’s a part of the experience, is enjoying it. I hope he got a chance to (enjoy) it, because I did. It’s fun to play with him and (Derrick) White, but then it’s also fun to play with some of the best players ever.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t moping around. I didn’t have an attitude. I wasn’t angry at the world,” Tatum said. “I stayed ready and did what was asked of me and I won a gold medal, right?”</p>

<p>“I know I didn’t make a jump shot when I was with Team USA. I don’t know, law of averages,” Tatum said. “It’s a weird rhythm thing being with Team USA; you never exactly know when you’re gonna get the ball. But that’s part of it. You sign up for that because I’ve done it before (at the Tokyo Games).”</p>

<p>Tatum and those around him have maintained he is not injured and hasn’t lost confidence in his shot. Though he shot 28.3 percent from deep in the playoffs and missed every jumper he took while on Team USA, he said he’s been playing basketball long enough that he’s not worried about getting back on track by October.</p>

<p>“I have two (gold medals) now, I have a championship, and everything doesn’t necessarily go the way you expect it to go, right?” Tatum said. “I’ve learned to be like, ‘OK, that’s a part of it.’ You move on, and I’m getting ready to enjoy the last little weeks I have before the season starts and get ready for another season.”</p>

<p>this right here is why he saw very little play time. You can&rsquo;t just throw a star that&rsquo;s used to playing 35+ minutes into the middle of a game and expect them to produce exactly the same. Especially when he&rsquo;s playing with all new players in a new system and a significantly reduced role.</p>

<p>Better than Tatum and can’t make it out of the first round with AD as his second option? Don’t you feel embarrassed with that take? Obviously not as humiliating as watching  PJ Washington creampie your team but probably fairly close right?</p>

<p>KD, because he is built like a famine victim, does not play well when you push him around.</p>

<p>Tatum, because he lifts, doesn’t care.</p>

<p>That’s what’s called a skill issue.</p>

<p>Well when you double Tatum he passes to his wide open teammate. How come KD couldn’t do that? He did have a 50/40/90 point guard+elite shooter patty mills to dish to right?</p>

<p>Is Kevin Durant a small guard? Because Tatum was deep frying him all series.</p>

<p>2 years ago</p>

<p>And coming to the conclusion that now today, because of that series, he is absolutely better lol.</p>

<p>Which defender primarily guarded KD?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>double teams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can’t hit an open guy when you’re doubled that’s a skill issue.</p>

<p>Sorry but Tatum gets doubled too and he doesn’t have kyrie Irving as a safety valve either. He still figures it out (which is what prevents people from doubling him).</p>

<p>Despite that, when he was 1-1 with Tatum, it was not pretty for KD.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 games</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can’t blame tstum for KD sucking shit so badly that he got swept. He should have played better so that we’d have 7 games instead.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well tstum got better and KD got worse so not sure how that helps you here.</p>

<p>FOR MY STATS/MATH PEOPLE………. if Tatum is actually just on a terrible shooting streak he should shoot above his average????? I think that’s how that works. What would his averages look like if the slump fixes itself?</p>
