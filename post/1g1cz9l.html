</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It could be bad, mediocre or great team.</p>

<p>My pick is the 1994 Denver Nuggets, 8th seed sub .500 record. Went down 0-2 against the Supersonics. Came back and won 3 straight games. Went down 0-3 against Jazz, won 3 straight games  forced game 7.  Unfortunately fell short in game 7.  The first 8th seed to upset a first seed and almost clinching a conference finals berth. They had pre-DPOY winner Dikembe Mutombo and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf who was 2 decades ahead of its time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about the NBA, please educate me with more interesting teams!</p>

<p>The Cavs had their own injuries. Kevin Love missed a game, Shumpert, Lebron, JR and Kyrie were all dealing with injuries.</p>

<p>Curry played well against okc but you can play well and still be injured. Curry looked much worse in the playoffs in general relative to 2015, even though he had clearly gotten better.</p>

<p>There was lots of talk of Curry’s injury. He played well prior to the Finals but we knew he was still injured. Kyrie outplayed him and he couldn’t shake Kevin Love of all people on the perimeter</p>

<p>Also Golden State needed a miracle Klay game to get by OKC</p>

<p>They also definitely lost the game Dray was suspended</p>

<p>Those things do all matter, especially the suspension which LeBron went all in on lobbying for postgame, but I don’t agree that it lessens how spectacular of a meltdown it was to lose that way</p>

      <label for="lrfk4r7" class="commentText"><p>Historically fascinating? I thought the 2004 Pistons were the most unlikely of champions I’d ever seen. The AI Sixers were shocking in getting to the finals and somehow winning a game against the Lakers pre-fat-Shaq era. I never thought a team could win the title without a HOF level player. I never thought a team could make a final with one guy carrying that much of the load. Then Lebron did it in 2007, 2015 and 2018 and we all decided it was normal.</p>

Sacramento was awesome they could never quite get past the lakers but it would take 7 games and they were all close. The lakers would always advance and completely sweep whoever came out of the east, Iverson included. I mean they had prime Kobe and Shaq. Those Kings were special though and had they found a way to get past the lakers they would have won multiple championships.</p>

Of course they got swept by the Cavs in the playoffs but they were a really fun story that season. Al Horford, Demarre Carroll, Kyle Korver, Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Dennis Schroeder, Thabo Sefolosha, Kent Bazemore, Mike Muscala…doesn’t sound like a great team on paper but 60 wins, can’t argue with that. Beat Brooklyn and Washington in the playoffs and got to their first ECF in forever.</p>

<p>Then as soon as it happened it was just over for them.</p>

They got swept that season and the season after that. If they weren’t such playoff flameouts and perhaps had better coaching, the history books could and should’ve had Bulls-Lakers Finals that had a Shaq-Jordan storyline, a Jordan-Kobe storyline (something that was always played up in their matchups that season), and maybe Phil Jackson doesn’t go to the Lakers immediately after facing them in the Finals. What could have been.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a borderline miracle that he was able to get that roster to .500 and one game short of a playoff spot. You&rsquo;d assume any team whose best player on the roster was Darrell Armstrong would be historically awful but not so!</p>

      <label for="lrgzr09" class="commentText"><p>The way the question’s phrased it probably has to be the 1960s Celtics who had a yet to be topped successful run (winning 9 out of 10 championships) in a notoriously racist northern city.</p>

<p>It’s depressing and most would rather focus on Xs and Os, but for “historically fascinating/interesting” what can top Bill Russell’s incredible Celtics in racist 1960s Boston at a time of massive social change and very real ugliness in America? Civil rights, riots, assassinations. There were a lot of big characters/personalities like Red Auerbach &amp; the team had unprecedented success (9 out of 10!), but the racist stuff Russell dealt with in Boston was fucking insane as well.</p>

      <label for="lrho924" class="commentText"><p>For me it will always be the 90-91 Bulls. Watching that shit on TV as a kid was just insane. You knew of Bird, Magic, Pistons, and other stuff going on, and the entire changing of the guard was probably the most memorable thing ever in the NBA for me. It was not at all certain they were going to win it. Jordan didn&rsquo;t even shoot that many free throws in the Finals, so there wasn&rsquo;t nearly as much ref help as in say The Last Dance.</p>

<p>Seeing parts of that season and those playoff games was just another world. Hard to put into words because NBA was just starting to get really popular. It changed basketball completely more than anything since IMO. Only Steph and the 3 is there with it in importance for the modern game, and that isn&rsquo;t something nearly as memorable as it occurred over a longer period. That 90-91 team just lit up the NBA like nothing else for tens of millions of people.</p>

      <label for="lrfjgy4" class="commentText"><p>2016 warriors. Their regular season was insane. And their playoff run was so dramatic.</p>

<p>Steph gets hurt in the first round, but they manage to get through it. In the second round, they win the first two at home vs portland but lose game 3. Steph comes back game 4, off the bench. He struggles for much of the game and then breaks the record for points in overtime.</p>

<p>In the WCF, the warriors are up against OKC. They get down 3-1 after being embarrassed in games 3 and 4. But they claw their way back.</p>

<p>Then they get up 3-1 on the cavs and everything seems all but done. The warriors overcame their biggest test in OKC and they&rsquo;ll win back to back. Clinching the greatest season in nba history. Then I watched Lebron and Kyrie both score 41. Kyrie just would not miss. And we know the rest.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a documentary on that season one day, right?</p>

      <label for="lrgceuj" class="commentText"><p>Why not the 2024 Celtics. They have so many statistical arguments for being a top 5 or 10 team in NBA history. But until the finals, you had like 50-67% of normal people going &ldquo;but Jayson Tatum isn&rsquo;t a top 5 player&rdquo;, &ldquo;Luka is better so the Mavs have the advantage just because of of that&rdquo; or my favorite &ldquo;The Pacers looked really good against them and because they had a &ldquo;easy&rdquo; run that means the Mavs should be favorites against&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s why polls (who weren&rsquo;t Vegas odds) before the finals always go against the Celtics. Not even mention how they look like literally like the top 3 most equalatible championship team as well.
   But they have massively interesting history to how they got their players as well. It isn’t just &ldquo;they simply drafted/trade/signed a top 15-50 player of all time&rdquo; it&rsquo;s has ties to their last championship contender in the big 3 Celtics where they did the Hershell Walker of NBA trades in the KG-Paul peirce trade (Boston should build a statue to the Danny Ainge and Billy King for that one btw) to get the Jays.
  After the 2022 finals (always a pretty interesting year). they trade for Derrick White. They trade their best backcourt and front court defenders in Marcus Smart and Rob Williams to <em>upgrade</em> and those positions to get Porzingus and Jrue Holiday.</p>
