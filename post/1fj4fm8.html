</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In professional sports, no coach should feel safe. Hell, even Bill Belichick got the <a href="https://villainstournament.fandom.com/wiki/The_Executioner_Guard" target="_blank">axe</a>.</p>

<p>All NBA coaches are always on notice, although some should feel more heat than others. Here&rsquo;s a look at the coaches in the most danger, and their estimated odds of surviving into 2025-26. <em>Note: for some of the older coaches, we&rsquo;re also factoring in a potential retirement so don&rsquo;t freak out when you see a certain Spur on here.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(10) Darko Rajakovic, Toronto Raptors</strong></p>

<p><em>record with team: 25-57</em></p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : After winning the title, the veteran Toronto Raptors have been slowly but surely stripped for parts and cast into a rebuild. But interestingly, Masai Ujiri hasn&rsquo;t taken a brazen deep dive into the tank. Instead, he&rsquo;s opted for younger veterans like Immanuel Quickley (25 years old), R.J. Barrett (24 years old), and Jakob Poeltl (28 years old) to go around cornerstone Scottie Barnes instead. In effect, that shortens the window for this core and for coach Darko Rajakovic, who can&rsquo;t feel 100% comfortable heading into Year 2.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : Masai Ujiri has a lot of power in the organization and can protect Darko Rajakovic for another couple of years if he wants. For his part, Rajakovic just <strong>can&rsquo;t embarrass his boss</strong> with an ugly season. 30 wins is probably fine. 20? That may be a problem.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : As mentioned, these Toronto Raptors are not <em>that</em> young. They&rsquo;re not <em>that</em> bad either. Remember: they intentionally tanked at the end of the year to protect their pick, losing 19 of their last 21. In a normal season, this team should be in that 30-35 win range and keep Rajakovic safe. We&rsquo;ll give his odds of survival a healthy <strong>85%</strong> as a result.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(9) Tom Thibodeau, New York Knicks</strong></p>

<p><em>records with team</em>: 41-31, 37-45, 47-35, 50-32</p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : Why is Tom Thibodeau on this list?? The vibes are great in New York right now. There&rsquo;s more optimism for the team than there has been in decades. But therein, my friend, lies the danger. Optimism leads to expectations. After adding Mikal Bridges, most fans are expecting the team to be a legitimate contender. Or at least, a legitimate contender to be the best team outside of Boston.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : Tom Thibodeau doesn&rsquo;t have to perform miracles here. Essentially, he just has to <strong>avoid a backslide</strong>. If the team loses fewer than 50 wins, or loses in the first round, then there may be grumbling about whether or not Thibs (now age 66) is the right man for the long haul. There are definitely viable candidates to replace him, including current assistant Johnnie Bryant and former Villanova coach Jay Wright.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : Barring injury, it&rsquo;s hard to see the Knicks being <em>bad</em>, so we&rsquo;ll list this at <strong>80%</strong> chance of survival. That injury issue may be doubly concerning though because Thibodeau&rsquo;s coaching style opens him up for criticism on the load management front. He&rsquo;ll be blamed for any injury no matter what the cause; if Jalen Brunson slips in the shower the media will say it&rsquo;s because Thibs&rsquo; rotations tired him out.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(8) Jason Kidd, Dallas Mavericks</strong></p>

<p><em>records with team: 52-30, 38-44, 50-32</em></p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : The average fan doesn&rsquo;t like Jason Kidd, but he&rsquo;s earned a lot of respect from NBA players and a lot of respect in the Dallas Mavericks&rsquo; building. After all, he helped bring them a title as a player, and he helped bring them to the NBA Finals as a coach. But expectations are always high when you have Luka Doncic, so Kidd will need to keep winning to keep his job.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : Jason Kidd already survived one down year (in 2022-23), but it&rsquo;s unclear if he could survive another now that his buddy Mark Cuban has a reduced role with the franchise. Making the playoffs may not even be enough. I&rsquo;d estimate that Kidd needs at least a <strong>respectable R1 showing</strong> (either a series win or a competitive series loss) to keep his grip on the job.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : There&rsquo;s always a combustibility when you combine big personalities like Kidd, Kyrie Irving, and Luka Doncic. But at the same time, it&rsquo;s hard to see a complete disaster on the court given Doncic&rsquo;s youth (still 25) and his solid supporting cast. Let&rsquo;s pencil Kidd&rsquo;s chances of returning in 2025-26 at <strong>80%</strong> accordingly.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(7) Quin Snyder, Atlanta Hawks</strong></p>

<p><em>records with team: 10-11, 36-46</em></p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : The Atlanta Hawks were so excited to bring in Quin Snyder that they did it in the middle of the regular season (in 2022-23). The idea was: Snyder would be able to fix their defensive problems that had plagued them for years. So far, that hasn&rsquo;t been the case. The Hawks ranked 27th in defense yet again, resulting in a disappointing 36 wins. If they take a step back from there, it&rsquo;d be fair to wonder about the direction of the franchise.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : Quin Snyder is a big-name coach with a big contract, so the ownership would only justify firing him if things get really ugly here. If the s&mdash; hits the fan, Snyder needs to duck and let someone else take the splat. Primarily: he needs to <strong>win any potential power battle</strong> against Trae Young. The Hawks have blamed everyone one already: Travis Schlenk, Lloyd Pierce, Nate McMillan, so if they struggle again then it may be time to throw in the towel on the Trae era.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : We&rsquo;re talking about a hypothetical disaster season here (around 30 wins), but in truth I don&rsquo;t anticipate that happening. If anything, the Hawks may be a value on their &ldquo;over&rdquo; of 35.5 wins. To me, it&rsquo;s more likely that they approach .500 than they finish below that. Let&rsquo;s give Snyder&rsquo;s survival odds at a solid <strong>80%</strong>. That said, a bad season will put him on the hot seat heading into 2025-26.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(6) Gregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs</strong></p>

<p><em>records with team: too long to list</em></p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : With 5 championships and 1388 regular season wins, Gregg Popovich has an argument for the best NBA coach of all time. But if sports is a &ldquo;what have you done for me lately?&rdquo; world, then there&rsquo;s more doubt here. The Spurs haven&rsquo;t had a winning season since 2018-19, bottoming out with 22-60 the last two years. As mentioned, the Patriots eventually parted ways with their legend &ndash; making the possibility of a forced retirement possible here if the team doesn&rsquo;t take the jump expected. And that expected jump is a giant LEAP &ndash; with a Vegas over/under of 36.5 wins.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : Even if the Spurs are slightly underwhelming and only win 30 games, Gregg Popovich should be fine. That is, as long as he <strong>keeps Victor Wembanyama&rsquo;s endorsement</strong>. It&rsquo;s crazy to say, but the 20-year-old Wemby absolutely has more juice than the 75-year-old coach at the point. If Wemby&rsquo;s camp starts grumbling behind the scenes about Pop&rsquo;s fitness for the future, a la George Clooney and the Democrats, then Pop may go the way of Bill Belichick or Joe Biden.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : The odds of Popovich getting fired against his own wishes is very low &ndash; less than 5%. At the very least, the Spurs would find a way to finesse it and keep him in the front office. But there&rsquo;s certainly some chance of a retirement on the horizon, so we&rsquo;ll call his odds of returning to the court in 2025-26 at only <strong>75%</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(5) Michael Malone, Denver Nuggets</strong></p>

<p><em>records with team: 33-49, 40-42, 46-36, 54-28, 46-27, 47-25, 48-34, 53-29, 57-25</em></p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : Mike Malone and the Denver Nuggets won a championship in 2023. But if you think that gives him a multi-year honeymoon period and immunity, ask Mike Budenholzer how that worked out in Milwaukee. Or Frank Vogel with the Lakers. There&rsquo;s also been some grumbling about Malone&rsquo;s fit with the front office. Malone isn&rsquo;t old (at age 52), but he&rsquo;s a little &ldquo;old school&rdquo;. The team doesn&rsquo;t shoot many threes and doesn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time developing their young players. If they can&rsquo;t fertilize that farm system, the team&rsquo;s depth will be in the danger zone.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : I don&rsquo;t think any realistic fan expects their team to win the championship year after year even if you have an MVP on the roster. Famously, Gegg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs never went back-to-back. Still, <strong>making the second round</strong> should be a reasonable line in the sand. If the Nuggets fall short of that, Malone may be in danger. There&rsquo;s even a ready-made replacement on staff in assistant David Adelman.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : Heading into Year 10 with the job, Mike Malone shouldn&rsquo;t feel content with his past success. He needs to prove that he&rsquo;s the right coach for the future. Fortunately for him, Nikola Jokic can cover for all manners of mediocrity around him and keep his survival odds at <strong>75%</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(4) Doc Rivers, Milwaukee Bucks</strong></p>

<p><em>record with team: 17-19</em></p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : As a coach, Doc Rivers is a playoff staple. In fact, his teams have made the playoffs in 16 of his last 17 seasons. It&rsquo;s what happens <em>after that</em> that&rsquo;s drawn his criticism. He hasn&rsquo;t made it out of the second round since all the way back in 2012. If the disappointment continues into his third stop &ndash; after the Clippers and after the Sixers &ndash; then it&rsquo;d be fair for the crowd to call for his head.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : Executions are expensive. The Bucks are already paying off Adrian Griffin &ndash; so paying off Doc Rivers&rsquo; giant new contract may be a bridge and a check too far. As long as Rivers&rsquo; Bucks are good enough to <strong>stay the course</strong> (and keep fighting for titles) then he should be fine. But if this rickety old ship combusts, then the carnage could include Rivers, Damian Lillard, and possibly even a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade demand.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : Given the contract situation, the odds of the Bucks firing Doc Rivers are relatively low (maybe 20%). But there&rsquo;s a larger chance that Rivers struggles and decides that he&rsquo;d rather retire than keep at this grind. He&rsquo;s only 62, but he&rsquo;s been chugging along as a head coach since 1999. All told, we&rsquo;ll give the odds of him returning in 2025-26 at <strong>70%</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(3) Willie Green, New Orleans Pelicans</strong></p>

<p><em>records with team: 36-46, 42-40, 49-33</em></p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : Under coach Willie Green, the Pelicans have improved by 6 wins and then by 7 more wins last season. That said, they may have been the most forgettable 49-win team in memory, mainly because they got swept 4-0 in the first round by OKC. A Zion Williamson injury buys you a pass on that one time, but it won&rsquo;t afforded twice. There&rsquo;s enough talent here to expect some playoff wins eventually.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : Willie Green should have a longer runway than most coaches entering Year 4. The team&rsquo;s chocked full of talent and youth &ndash; giving them a long window and the ability to be patient. But at the very least, <strong>making the play-in</strong> should be the minimum standard here. As long as the team&rsquo;s in the top ten, that should keep Green safe for now. The personnel (like Brandon Ingram or C.J. McCollum) will probably be the scapegoat instead.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : Is it possible for the 7th seed Pelicans to drop all the way down to 11? In the West, it is. The veteran Lakers, Kings, and Warriors could all jump them. Memphis is projected to as well. Then you have ascending teams like Houston and San Antonio who may arrive earlier than scheduled. All in all, Green <em>should</em> still be safe, but the lingering danger keeps this at only <strong>70%</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(2) Billy Donovan, Chicago Bulls</strong></p>

<p><em>records with team</em>: 46-36, 40-42, 39-43</p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : Don Quixote chased windmills. The Chicago Bulls have chased 8th seeds. There&rsquo;s something noble and honorable about that pursuit, but it&rsquo;s ultimately drenched with delusion. To be honest, it&rsquo;s hard to blame <em>Billy Donovan</em> for that. If anything, his only crime in Chicago has been his ability to get the most out of his roster. The Bulls haven&rsquo;t been outright bad&hellip; yet. The front office is finally starting to embrace the youth movement though, which may make Donovan a relic of their past.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : The Bulls need to firmly &ldquo;pick a lane&rdquo;. Do they keep Zach LaVine and chase the play-in again? Do they tear it down and turn the team over to youngsters like Matas Buzelis? In either case, you can argue that Billy Donovan is qualified for the assignment. As a former college coach, he should be able to <strong>develop young talent</strong>. If he can show his worth to that end, then it&rsquo;ll help ownership that he&rsquo;s the right man for the rebuild.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : This situation could go either way. The Bulls may fire Donovan. Donovan may get sick of the Bulls&rsquo; mediocrity and go elsewhere (maybe retirement? maybe back to college?). Overall that uncertainty leaves this his return in 2025-26 at around <strong>50%</strong>. Heck, it may even be lower than that.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(1) Chauncey Billups, Portland Trail Blazers</strong></p>

<p><em>records with team: 27-55, 33-49, 21-61</em></p>

<p><em>the danger</em> : Back in 2021, Portland took a chance in hiring Chauncey Billups despite limited coaching experience (1 year as an assistant). In the three years since then, the franchise has experienced such memorable moments as&hellip; uh&hellip; hm. We&rsquo;ll have to get back to you on that. The Damian Lillard era combusted. The Scoot Henderson era got off to a slow start. They&rsquo;ll roll back with Billups and a young team, projected to win the fewest games in the West. It certainly feels like the clock is ticking on Billups, who allegedly had a 5-year contract with the club.</p>

<p><em>the salvation</em> : The Blazers should be a <em>little</em> bit better this year. They added some actual defenders this time around in Deni Avidja and rookie Donovan Clingan. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll start to resemble a functional basketball squad. But given the stacked West, it&rsquo;d be asking a lot for this team to even climb into play-in range. A more realistic hope would be that <strong>Scoot Henderson (or Shaedon Sharpe) breaks out as a sure-fire future All-Star</strong> and gives Coach Billups a foundational piece to hang his hat on.</p>

<p><em>odds of survival</em> : NBA clubs rarely let a contract run out; they either want to extend a lame duck coach or fire him and start the process all over again. It&rsquo;s difficult to see Billups mustering up enough enthusiasm for an extension, so I&rsquo;d give his survival at only a <strong>40%</strong> chance, the lowest on our board.</p>

      <label for="lnlkq19" class="commentText"><p>Not that everyone else has zero chances of getting fired (especially if things go south), Willie Green is really the only guy on here who absolutely has a hot as hell seat and few excuses to fall back on.</p>

<p>And while I like Taylor Jenkins a lot, I think he&rsquo;s definitely under pressure for the Grizzlies to at the very least make the playoffs this season.</p>

<p>Other than that I&rsquo;m not really expecting any coach firings this season <em>at the moment</em>. Too many guys who are either brand new, established, or the stakes are so low there&rsquo;s no point in doing it now. Of course, that can always change and it&rsquo;s a long season.</p>

      <label for="lnlkv0e" class="commentText"><p>Doc is obviously on the hot seat considering the necessity of a quick start and really a championship in Milwaukee with they being in a ring-or-bust mode. So if they&rsquo;re not in the mix for a chip, he&rsquo;s gonna be fired, possibly in-season.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nobody else outside of Billups on a hotter seat but I don&rsquo;t think Billups is on a hot seat per se, more warm seat. Blazers need to take a step forward this season but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s coaching for his job necessarily.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see Donovan as being on the hot seat, but I can see he walking away. I can see the organization deciding to go with a younger coach with their youth movement but then again, the Bulls haven&rsquo;t fully tanked their roster yet and don&rsquo;t seem to intend to do so.</p>

<p>Malone could walk away and that wouldn&rsquo;t shock me in Denver if things don&rsquo;t go well, have an early PO exit. I wouldn&rsquo;t be shocked if he&rsquo;s fired either.</p>

      <label for="lnllf4x" class="commentText"><p>Can&rsquo;t see it with Pop.</p>

<p>With Belichick, a large part of the problem was that he was also singlehandedly calling all the shots on the roster and had complete control over players and coaches.  And he was really struggling with that side of the job - in a league where you can overhaul a roster completely in 2 seasons, 5 years of struggle is not ok.  If Bill was ok stepping back from the GM role, it&rsquo;s possible he&rsquo;d still actually be coach of the Patriots - his in game coaching was still fine, great even.</p>

<p>The Spurs, on the other hand, do actually have a GM.  It&rsquo;s not Pop&rsquo;s fault they&rsquo;ve sucked for 5 years, it&rsquo;s more been an intentional sell off of talent to tank for high draft picks.  Great as Wemby will be, the team isn&rsquo;t there yet to really compete for much.</p>

      <label for="lnlk3su" class="commentText"><p>Anything is <em>possible</em>. Let&rsquo;s say Brook Lopez and Khris Middleton look like they hit a wall. Are Dame and Giannis content to keep sticking it out with the rest of the roster?</p>

<p>He put an international assassins bounty out on his own head, has been wrestling timber rattlesnakes and has trained Boston’s mutated rad-rats to ravenously pursue his scent whenever he leaves the garden.</p>

<p>Odds of survival? Extremely low for all who challenge Joe.</p>
