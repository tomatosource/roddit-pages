    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Celtics dominated the regular season last year with a 64-18 record and all-time net rating. They carried that dominance in the post-season as well, going 16-3. They have arguably 5 all-star calibre players in their starting lineup and a pretty decent bench. They&rsquo;re also bringing back the same team for this upcoming season, giving them continuity on the roster.</p>

<p>So, how can this team be defeated? Which teams can potentially give these Celtics the most trouble and why?</p>

<p>Celtics for some reason cannot fully stop Joker.</p>

<p>This is like a nemesis/matchup thing.</p>

<p>Like Timberwolves have the personnel to Contain Jokic. But they had a very hard time against Luka and Kyrie.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Celtics have the personnel to Contain Luka and Kyrie. But they had a very hard time against Jokic.</p>

<p>Because Embiid put up <sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> on 42/20/88 shooting splits against the Cs in 2023, with a horrible game 7 (iirc Tobias Harris outscored him in that game).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if /r/NBA is ready for this discourse but Tatum is actually our best defender btw. Jrue/White are insane, not gonna deny that&rsquo;s a rough ask for any guard to attack, but if you look at the different defensive schemes we pulled out through the playoffs JT played a different role every series tailored to the opponent. That kind of defensive versatility is special.</p>

<p>The simple and easy retort is that, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the regular season, not the playoffs&rdquo; but that never stops fans from thinking about the &ldquo;What-If&rdquo; of it all. Hell, my Kings feasted on Denver and the Wolves in the regular season, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop people from thinking it&rsquo;d translate in the playoffs, or thinking that it won&rsquo;t translate.</p>

<p>Thankfully over the course of this run the Celtics did WAY better in those situations than they have in the past, so hopefully that is behind them. I&rsquo;m less concerned about that specifically this year.</p>

<p>Jokic is still a problem for us though so it&rsquo;d be a tough series </p>

      <label for="ln3orpp" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s specifically saying we didn&rsquo;t shut down Luka. We took away his passes by playing single coverage on him (remember how few lobs there were?) and forced him into relatively inefficient shots with great iso defense. That&rsquo;s why he finished the series with a 53% TS and 5.6 APG</p>

      <label for="ln381j8" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics&rsquo; entire defensive strategy in the finals was to use Luka and Kyrie&rsquo;s tendency to go for midrange ISO jumpers against them by not doubling while also taking away the corner 3 and lobs. The C&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t trying to contain Luka, just lead him into the shots they preferred him to take. What series did you watch?</p>

He just couldn&rsquo;t hit a 3, and the Mavs &lsquo;others&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t hit anything from the wings - which was good game planning and having the right personnel from Boston but PJ / DJ / Josh Green&rsquo;s inability to make wide open wing 3s doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with how Luka played. If they hit shots from that spot at even an average clip Luka&rsquo;s assist numbers would&rsquo;ve been his season averages</p>

It was the right strategy because no one in a Mav jersey could make anything from the wing, but lets not pretend Luka didn&rsquo;t find guys wide open all series. They just weren&rsquo;t in the spots they&rsquo;re as good at - which is kudos to the Celtics D and gameplan but has nothing to do with Luka</p>

      <label for="ln3bhxj" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think he was.</p>

<p>Tatum averaged 22/8/7 on 50.5 TS and 3.2 TOs
Luka averaged 29/9/5.6 on 53.0 TS and 4.6 TOs</p>

<p>On purely that, Luka had the slight edge as a scorer while Tatum had the slight edge as playmaker. However, Tatum faced more defensive attention throughout the series, his rebounds were far more valuable as he was getting contested rebounds against centers while Luka was getting uncontested ones, and finally Luka played genuinely horrific defense while Tatum’s defensive versatility was the key to shutting down your offense. Luka also had that crucial game 3 foul out that basically sealed their fate.</p>

<p>Obviously it’s hard to distill everything down to two players individual stats when it’s a team game, but I’d say Tatum was better in the finals. Obviously things like how your teammates shot, defenders around you, etc. matter but Luka really wasn’t good this finals.</p>

<p>He was an inefficient scorer (though everyone was), his playmaking was fine but far from the elite and special levels it normally is, but he spent a lot of time complaining and not defending at all, and was having some fouling problems. He was the best player in the Mavs for sure but the Mavs were incredibly disappointing all around. They got pretty thoroughly beat down in every facet of the game and Luka was nowhere near individually great enough for me to say he was the best player in that series.</p>

      <label for="ln2nrwc" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d just put SGA on Holiday, Caruso on White, Dort on Brown and JWill on Tatum. If Tatum gets hot, then switch Dort and JWill, else just let him play iso ball. Again, we&rsquo;ll see about the offense.</p>

<p>Last year, the Thunder hit 40% on threes as a team and the only way we stopped them was ignoring Giddey who is now gone and replaced by a much better defender and shooter.</p>

<p>And I absolutely hate the Thunder. I don&rsquo;t like any of them except maybe JWill and the new guys, I have no strong feelings towards them. So I&rsquo;m not biased in the Thunder&rsquo;s favor.</p>

<p>SGA and JDub are both good defenders. Chet gave the Jays fits on switches last year.</p>

<p>Caruso is literally known for his defense on bigger wings than smaller guards lmao. It’s not even like either Brown or Tatum were dominant offensively in the Finals even against PJ and DJJ.</p>

      <label for="ln2s5c7" class="commentText"><p>I agree, I don&rsquo;t see how DJJ is a better defender than JWill on Brown physically. And either way, the Mavs struggled on offense because no one could hit shots. The Thunder shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with that cause they should be a top 3 three point shooting team again.</p>

<p>Defensively, we kept the Celtics to the lowest points of all their playoff opponents. And that includes them targeting injured Luka and Kyrie on offense. Who are they gonna target on the Thunder? Caruso or SGA? Good luck with that, especially with Dort and Chet helping.</p>

      <label for="ln2bkk0" class="commentText"><p>As a Celtics fan, I expect the Knicks, Pacers, and Magic to give Boston the hardest road back to the Finals. All are capable of winning a playoff series.</p>

<p>First, anyone saying Philly hasn’t paid attention to recent history.</p>

<p>Until proven otherwise, any MKE-BOS playoff matchup has the Jrue Holiday revenge factor that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>MIA is always a pain in the ass but they required massive shooting luck to beat the Celtics two years ago and the roster has stagnated or gotten worse. I suppose if Jimmy if healthy, it’s a series, but BOS should be heavily favored.</p>

<p>Those are good teams but they don’t matchup with BOS well and will lose a playoff series.</p>

<p>The Knicks have great perimeter defenders but have a size problem against BOS. However, the potential Achilles Heel of the Celtics is the health of Porzingis and Horford. Assuming a playoff series with no KP and no Mitchell Robinson (because Thibs has broken that guy already), the Knicks will be competitive.</p>

<p>The Pacers boneheadedly threw away two games in the ECF last year and Haliburton wasn’t healthy. Their mix of pace, shooting, and defense can make the Celtics work, hard.</p>

<p>The Magic have given the Celtics problems for years, because they are very long and very defensively focused.</p>

      <label for="ln320xq" class="commentText"><p>Sigh. Jrue Holiday is one of the best on-ball defenders in the League and will be somewhat motivated to “go off” defensively against the guy he was literally traded for.</p>

<p>Also, Lopez and Middleton are ancient and injured. Milwaukee’s window closed before they swapped Jrue for Dame but that trade made Boston a title winner and Milwaukee a defensive cupcake.</p>

<p>Milwaukee matches up terribly with the Celtics, now. And Jrue Holiday is the (defensive) reason.</p>

<p>We’ve jettisoned Tobias Harris, and some key players will now have had a few seasons to gel with Dr nick nurse’s system. To say nothing of the trades themselves. There’s just way too much that’s different than to write them off outright. Fuckin James harden left, no one was around to replace him, and we <em>still</em> had a commendable season.</p>

That doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t beat us, they absolutely could but it&rsquo;d be because of Giannis and/or Dame&rsquo;s individual brilliance, not because of the roster construction. I would say you guys match up much better with us than they do</p>

<p>Current bucks dont have the same personnel to guard giannis.</p>

<p>They are a better overall team specially in offense -and- bucks are older and specially lack bench play (their starting lineup was still great last year) which is the real difference imo</p>

      <label for="ln37qg6" class="commentText"><p>so looking at last year there were some evident statistical trends for when the Celtics lost</p>

<ol>
<li><p>12 out of 21 Celtics losses featured the opponent making at least 15 3s or shooting at least 40% from deep as a team. however, the Celtics record when the opponent made 15+ 3s last season was still 20-12 overall, and 17-12 when the opponent shot 40% or better from 3, so shooting well alone is not enough.</p></li>

<li><p>Celtics had a dead even 14-14 record when shooting 33.3% or worse from 3 as a team. 6 of those Ls featured the opponent knocking down 15+ 3s while 7 featured the opponent shooting 40% or better from 3. 12 of 21 Celtics losses also featured Boston making less than 15 3s (overall record of 17-12)</p></li>

<li><p>Celtics gave up 10 or more offensive rebounds in 14 out of 21 losses. but when giving up 10+ offensive rebounds their record was still 41-14</p></li>

<li><p>Celtics turned it over 12+ times in 15 out of 21 losses but still had a 35-15 record when turning the ball over 12+ times. 11 of 21 Celtics losses featured the opponent turning it over 10 times or less (37-11 overall)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>in terms of personnel you obviously need shooting. you also want guys with size and length who can match up with the Jays on the perimeter, but defensively if you have any player that’s a defensive weak link the Celtics will find them and exploit them relentlessly; since any guy on the floor can set a screen for PnR there’s just no hiding your bad defenders against them. you need guys who can hold their own against the dribble and rotate crisply</p>

<p>so basically the most important thing is 3P shooting. 15 appears to be the magic number - you need to make at least 15 3s on great efficiency while limiting the Celtics to less than 15 3s on poor efficiency. it’s also important to grab offensive rebounds, force turnovers and take care of the ball to maximize your own possessions and limit Boston’s. and you need to have a lineup with the size and length to guard the Jays, as well as switch multiple positions</p>

<p>based on this I’d say the team that best matches up is the <strong>Thunder.</strong> last year they were the most efficient 3P shooting team in the league, one of the best teams at forcing turnovers and one of the better teams at avoiding turnovers themselves. they were a bad rebounding team, but the addition of Hartenstein projects to help them out a lot in that department. they have plenty of quality perimeter defenders in Dort, JDub, Caruso, Wiggins and Wallace (though those guys are generally a bit lacking in length) and their starting 5 won’t have any defensive weak links</p>

<p>in the East I’d say the <strong>Knicks.</strong> they have several good 3P shooters, they love attacking the offensive glass, and they have two of the best wing defenders in the game. but the loss of Hartenstein definitely could hurt them in the rebounding department and with Brunson as their best player Boston will have a clear target on every single possession; I’m also not very high on Randle as a second option as he is a turnover machine and you really have to take care of the rock against Boston</p>

      <label for="ln2laif" class="commentText"><p>The Pacers could give them trouble, but it depends on health. If the key players on the team remain injury-free [a.n. I tried to make that “uninjured” and autocorrect wanted it to be “uninsured,” which cracked me up], the Pacers could give the C’s a long series if nothing else. I still think Boston’s got the better team, as much as I hate to admit it, but Indy gives any team trouble when we’re firing on all cylinders.</p>

      <label for="ln2pxsy" class="commentText"><p>The issue most teams run into is not having the personnel to guard 5 out. Even the nuggets don’t have the personnel but we got unlucky against them since we decided to shoot like shit from 3 both games and Jokic went off offensively. A lot of the Celtics possessions look the same and it doesn’t really matter what personnel you have out there if you play a center. It’s going to be dribble drive into dribble drive into dribble drive until someone is open for a 3 assuming one of the 5 people driving doesn’t just get to the basket. I’d go with the thunder if I had to pick a team. Respectfully jwill and dort aren’t going to lock up brown and Tatum though. People think you can just stick any decent wing defender on them. That’s just now how it works at all since both of these guys are elite at getting to and finishing at the rim.</p>

      <label for="ln29mtn" class="commentText"><p>Probably Philly (if healthy), Denver or the Lakers (if Healthy, add players, and AD is a beast again in the playoffs) are the most likely.</p>

<p>I think it will have to be a team with a true big target that troubles KP and an aging Horford, and is big enough that none of the (now 3) J&rsquo;s can switch up to them. Maybe Giannis could also be that type of player for the Bucks as well, but I think Boston&rsquo;s at least can do a better job against him the other 3 guys.</p>

<p>Now do any of those teams have a true 4-5 man defence that could stop the Celtics if everything is flowing well? Probably not. But I think if you break down Boston&rsquo;s defence then that goes a long way.</p>

<p>Boston do deserve to be favourites. But I wouldn&rsquo;t consider them outright favourites against the field. There&rsquo;s a whole season and 4 playoff series&rsquo; to play. A lot can develop in that time.</p>

      <label for="ln23fjd" class="commentText"><p>In the East Philly probably, the Knicks won&rsquo;t have enough offense to beat Boston IMO</p>

<p>In the West, Denver still matches up well with Boston, but I don&rsquo;t see them getting to the finals. OKC I&rsquo;m not sure, they clearly can guard Boston, but I have to see J-Dub and Chet being able to score efficiently vs a tough switching defense to be convinced.</p>

<p>I want to see that play out in a 7-game matchup, mostly so I can tell Boston fans to kick rocks when the Nugs pull it off lmao</p>

      <label for="ln28ucb" class="commentText"><p>Jokic. Embiid. Giannis. Those three guys could beat Boston in the playoffs. Lakers. Minny. Basically any team with size and defense and/or a dominant big can beat them.</p>

<p>And then the Heat and Warriors are dark horses here. They’ve had Boston’s number the past few seasons despite being clearly outmatched.</p>

      <label for="ln2afhk" class="commentText"><p>Lakers are a good defensive team with size and length and a league best whistle. They beat a fully healthy Celtics without Bron and AD last season.</p>

<p>Embiid, it really just depends on his personal health. With Maxey taking a huge leap, and Paul George providing some spark plug scoring/shooting, 76ers can be a threat now.</p>

<p>Neither team would be my first choice for a Celtic stopper but they can definitely compete against them for sure.</p>

      <label for="ln2aopz" class="commentText"><p>This is the team that&rsquo;s the best matchup. The lakers win was clearly the Celtics letting their guard down with players sitting.</p>

<p>In the last few years the teams that play the best against Boston have scoring bigs and very good defensive wings. The Lakers are a good defensive team but their wing defense has been pretty bad. They also play slow as hell which falls into what Boston does defensively</p>

<p>Were talking about the best team in basketball. And the lakers are mid.</p>

      <label for="ln2c23t" class="commentText"><p>As far as Lakers go, it depends if we’re talking regular season or playoffs. They are very mid in the regular season.</p>

<p>They do step it up in the playoffs though. They just made the third round two seasons ago, and unfortunately just ran into their own stopper, the Nuggets, in the first round last season. They played good, they just literally can’t beat Jokic.</p>

<p>If we’re talking regular season games, I’ll take Celtics.</p>

<p>In a seven game playoff series though, I could see it going either way. Again, not my first choice though. Just a team that I think has a realistic shot in a seven game series.</p>

<p>Not sure who my first choice would be. Probably 76ers or Nuggets.</p>
