    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Celtics dominated the regular season last year with a 64-18 record and all-time net rating. They carried that dominance in the post-season as well, going 16-3. They have arguably 5 all-star calibre players in their starting lineup and a pretty decent bench. They&rsquo;re also bringing back the same team for this upcoming season, giving them continuity on the roster.</p>

<p>So, how can this team be defeated? Which teams can potentially give these Celtics the most trouble and why?</p>

      <label for="ln28ucb" class="commentText"><p>Jokic. Embiid. Giannis. Those three guys could beat Boston in the playoffs. Lakers. Minny. Basically any team with size and defense and/or a dominant big can beat them.</p>

<p>And then the Heat and Warriors are dark horses here. They’ve had Boston’s number the past few seasons despite being clearly outmatched.</p>

      <label for="ln2afhk" class="commentText"><p>Lakers are a good defensive team with size and length and a league best whistle. They beat a fully healthy Celtics without Bron and AD last season.</p>

<p>Embiid, it really just depends on his personal health. With Maxey taking a huge leap, and Paul George providing some spark plug scoring/shooting, 76ers can be a threat now.</p>

<p>Neither team would be my first choice for a Celtic stopper but they can definitely compete against them for sure.</p>

      <label for="ln2aopz" class="commentText"><p>This is the team that&rsquo;s the best matchup. The lakers win was clearly the Celtics letting their guard down with players sitting.</p>

<p>In the last few years the teams that play the best against Boston have scoring bigs and very good defensive wings. The Lakers are a good defensive team but their wing defense has been pretty bad. They also play slow as hell which falls into what Boston does defensively</p>

<p>Were talking about the best team in basketball. And the lakers are mid.</p>

      <label for="ln2c23t" class="commentText"><p>As far as Lakers go, it depends if we’re talking regular season or playoffs. They are very mid in the regular season.</p>

<p>They do step it up in the playoffs though. They just made the third round two seasons ago, and unfortunately just ran into their own stopper, the Nuggets, in the first round last season. They played good, they just literally can’t beat Jokic.</p>

<p>If we’re talking regular season games, I’ll take Celtics.</p>

<p>In a seven game playoff series though, I could see it going either way. Again, not my first choice though. Just a team that I think has a realistic shot in a seven game series.</p>

<p>Not sure who my first choice would be. Probably 76ers or Nuggets.</p>

<p>Celtics for some reason cannot fully stop Joker.</p>

<p>This is like a nemesis/matchup thing.</p>

<p>Like Timberwolves have the personnel to Contain Jokic. But they had a very hard time against Luka and Kyrie.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Celtics have the personnel to Contain Luka and Kyrie. But they had a very hard time against Jokic.</p>

      <label for="ln274by" class="commentText"><p>its because they have the 2 best guard defenders in the league (White and Holiday) so if the other teams best players are not guards its gonna be a much tougher matchup, Celtics are also arguably weakest at the Center position since Porzingis is likely to miss a lot of the season/games</p>

      <label for="ln2bkk0" class="commentText"><p>As a Celtics fan, I expect the Knicks, Pacers, and Magic to give Boston the hardest road back to the Finals. All are capable of winning a playoff series.</p>

<p>First, anyone saying Philly hasn’t paid attention to recent history.</p>

<p>Until proven otherwise, any MKE-BOS playoff matchup has the Jrue Holiday revenge factor that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>MIA is always a pain in the ass but they required massive shooting luck to beat the Celtics two years ago and the roster has stagnated or gotten worse. I suppose if Jimmy if healthy, it’s a series, but BOS should be heavily favored.</p>

<p>Those are good teams but they don’t matchup with BOS well and will lose a playoff series.</p>

<p>The Knicks have great perimeter defenders but have a size problem against BOS. However, the potential Achilles Heel of the Celtics is the health of Porzingis and Horford. Assuming a playoff series with no KP and no Mitchell Robinson (because Thibs has broken that guy already), the Knicks will be competitive.</p>

<p>The Pacers boneheadedly threw away two games in the ECF last year and Haliburton wasn’t healthy. Their mix of pace, shooting, and defense can make the Celtics work, hard.</p>

<p>The Magic have given the Celtics problems for years, because they are very long and very defensively focused.</p>

      <label for="ln23fjd" class="commentText"><p>In the East Philly probably, the Knicks won&rsquo;t have enough offense to beat Boston IMO</p>

<p>In the West, Denver still matches up well with Boston, but I don&rsquo;t see them getting to the finals. OKC I&rsquo;m not sure, they clearly can guard Boston, but I have to see J-Dub and Chet being able to score efficiently vs a tough switching defense to be convinced.</p>

      <label for="ln29mtn" class="commentText"><p>Probably Philly (if healthy), Denver or the Lakers (if Healthy, add players, and AD is a beast again in the playoffs) are the most likely.</p>

<p>I think it will have to be a team with a true big target that troubles KP and an aging Horford, and is big enough that none of the (now 3) J&rsquo;s can switch up to them. Maybe Giannis could also be that type of player for the Bucks as well, but I think Boston&rsquo;s at least can do a better job against him the other 3 guys.</p>

<p>Now do any of those teams have a true 4-5 man defence that could stop the Celtics if everything is flowing well? Probably not. But I think if you break down Boston&rsquo;s defence then that goes a long way.</p>

<p>Boston do deserve to be favourites. But I wouldn&rsquo;t consider them outright favourites against the field. There&rsquo;s a whole season and 4 playoff series&rsquo; to play. A lot can develop in that time.</p>
