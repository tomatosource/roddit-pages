    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Celtics dominated the regular season last year with a 64-18 record and all-time net rating. They carried that dominance in the post-season as well, going 16-3. They have arguably 5 all-star calibre players in their starting lineup and a pretty decent bench. They&rsquo;re also bringing back the same team for this upcoming season, giving them continuity on the roster.</p>

<p>So, how can this team be defeated? Which teams can potentially give these Celtics the most trouble and why?</p>

<p>Celtics for some reason cannot fully stop Joker.</p>

<p>This is like a nemesis/matchup thing.</p>

<p>Like Timberwolves have the personnel to Contain Jokic. But they had a very hard time against Luka and Kyrie.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Celtics have the personnel to Contain Luka and Kyrie. But they had a very hard time against Jokic.</p>

      <label for="ln39a87" class="commentText"><p>Over that same past two year sample size Philly is 2-6 against the Celtics. Those counting stats are well and good but Jokic comes away with the one stat that actually matters.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if /r/NBA is ready for this discourse but Tatum is actually our best defender btw. Jrue/White are insane, not gonna deny that&rsquo;s a rough ask for any guard to attack, but if you look at the different defensive schemes we pulled out through the playoffs JT played a different role every series tailored to the opponent. That kind of defensive versatility is special.</p>

      <label for="ln46352" class="commentText"><p>Point of attack/on ball defense is sexy, point of attack defense is easiest to evaluate using the eye test. JT is somewhere between 2nd and 4th best PoA defender (Jrue is easily #1 and then there&rsquo;s hardly any separation between White, Jaylen, and JT, just player matchups that are better or worse.) Because of that, I can&rsquo;t fault anyone who disagrees with me.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s a 5v5 game. This isn&rsquo;t the early 2000&rsquo;s where the game was a series of 1v1 isos anymore, and off ball defense, switching, reading the flow of the offense matters. Off ball stuff is way harder to evaluate for the average fan, <em>especially</em> at game speed instead of film room, pause/rewind type tape watching. Jayson Tatum is, not just on the team but in the whole league, one of the best at it.</p>

<p>Look at the finals series. Throughout the playoffs the Mavs single most efficient play had been the lobs to their bigs. They couldn&rsquo;t even attempt them because coach put JT at center and he took the option for the pass away. He did force one or two turnovers when they tried but that&rsquo;s not exactly stuffing the stat sheet. It&rsquo;s the Revis problem, guy never had gaudy interception numbers because they didn&rsquo;t dare test him. But the end result is that the Mavs couldn&rsquo;t even try to run their best play. It&rsquo;s just one example, but you can find unique JT usages from every series to do something similar, get teams uncomfortable on offense.</p>

<p>Now obviously a big chunk of the credit has to go to Joe for not just drilling the scheme so well with JT, but the rest of the defense to understand what roles they have to take up when JT does something unique. Everyone&rsquo;s execution was fucking textbook, I don&rsquo;t mean to take anything away from anyone else on the team. It&rsquo;s a puzzle that the whole team has to solve together. But JT is a truly special off ball defender, and it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s some scrub on ball either, just ask KD after the Nets sweep.</p>

      <label for="ln46ijz" class="commentText"><p>I understand Tatum&rsquo;s off ball impact, but when our other players got put into that situation (mainly JB or Jrue) they were also very successful. Both of those guys just have set on ball assignments so they couldn&rsquo;t play in the paint as often as JT</p>

<p>And white and KP are both excellent rim protectors, something that Tatum is not great at</p>

      <label for="ln48bje" class="commentText"><p>I get that White&rsquo;s block timings are something truly special, but if he&rsquo;s the guy at the rim it&rsquo;s still a better outcome for the offense than JT based on opponent fg% within 5 feet. There&rsquo;s nobody else under 6&rsquo;6 who I&rsquo;d rather have at the rim in a pinch, obviously, but it&rsquo;s still better to have someone 6&rsquo;10 there (or 7&rsquo;3, haha.) Everyone has their strengths, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such a fantastic defense. But JT is the guy who doesn&rsquo;t have clear weaknesses. At the rim is the closest thing to it, but there he&rsquo;s just average unless he&rsquo;s matched up on someone who won an MVP in the last 6 years (because nobody in the league really wins those matchups.)</p>

      <label for="ln48vpe" class="commentText"><p>I guess my main issue with what you&rsquo;re saying is that I feel like a lot of Tatum&rsquo;s defensive success comes from mazzulla&rsquo;s scheming in a way that doesn&rsquo;t exist for anyone else on the team. Tatum&rsquo;s obviously still a very good defender and fits very nicely into what mazzulla wants to do, I just think the rest of the lineup has more defensive value in their roles. Like, I think JB could do what Tatum is doing on defense, but I don&rsquo;t believe the opposite to be true</p>

<p>They played two games down to the wire last year in which Boston shot 30% from deep. Even average shooting games and they take both.</p>

<p>Celtics went 3-1 against Denver prior two seasons before last year in more decisive victories.</p>

Since it didn&rsquo;t happen in the playoffs, the only thing we can do is ponder and hypothesize what would happen if it did. And the only evidence we can look to is their 2 regular season games.</p>

<p>The simple and easy retort is that, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the regular season, not the playoffs&rdquo; but that never stops fans from thinking about the &ldquo;What-If&rdquo; of it all. Hell, my Kings feasted on Denver and the Wolves in the regular season, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop people from thinking it&rsquo;d translate in the playoffs, or thinking that it won&rsquo;t translate.</p>

      <label for="ln3kg2x" class="commentText"><p>A lot of the concern boiled down to the premise that the Celtics over the last few years really struggled to close out close games (clogged toilet offense) while the nuggets seemed automatic in those scenarios thanks to the decision-making of Jokic. </p>

<p>Thankfully over the course of this run the Celtics did WAY better in those situations than they have in the past, so hopefully that is behind them. I&rsquo;m less concerned about that specifically this year.</p>

<p>Jokic is still a problem for us though so it&rsquo;d be a tough series </p>

      <label for="ln5bv36" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics&rsquo; go-to strategy for a while has just been to shut down Jokic&rsquo;s teammates. His one weakness I&rsquo;ve noticed is that if he starts feeling like he has to do everything himself and has no help, he will start getting frustrated and then you just have to wait for a couple calls not to go his way and he will go on tilt and sometimes even throw the game entirely, or at least let you go on a huge run.</p>

<p>Now the thing is, that was much easier to accomplish A. in the time Murray was injured in the past, and B. before they got Gordon. AG is lowkey the x-factor of the entire Nuggets team because having him as an inside threat for Jokic to dish it to for an easy bucket any time the play breaks down is an incredible stabilizing force even when your role players are getting shut down on the perimeter. So it ends up being much harder for Jokic to get rattled and the Nuggets become a tough team to beat.</p>

      <label for="ln3bhxj" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think he was.</p>

<p>Tatum averaged 22/8/7 on 50.5 TS and 3.2 TOs
Luka averaged 29/9/5.6 on 53.0 TS and 4.6 TOs</p>

<p>On purely that, Luka had the slight edge as a scorer while Tatum had the slight edge as playmaker. However, Tatum faced more defensive attention throughout the series, his rebounds were far more valuable as he was getting contested rebounds against centers while Luka was getting uncontested ones, and finally Luka played genuinely horrific defense while Tatum’s defensive versatility was the key to shutting down your offense. Luka also had that crucial game 3 foul out that basically sealed their fate.</p>

<p>Obviously it’s hard to distill everything down to two players individual stats when it’s a team game, but I’d say Tatum was better in the finals. Obviously things like how your teammates shot, defenders around you, etc. matter but Luka really wasn’t good this finals.</p>

<p>He was an inefficient scorer (though everyone was), his playmaking was fine but far from the elite and special levels it normally is, but he spent a lot of time complaining and not defending at all, and was having some fouling problems. He was the best player in the Mavs for sure but the Mavs were incredibly disappointing all around. They got pretty thoroughly beat down in every facet of the game and Luka was nowhere near individually great enough for me to say he was the best player in that series.</p>

It was the right strategy because no one in a Mav jersey could make anything from the wing, but lets not pretend Luka didn&rsquo;t find guys wide open all series. They just weren&rsquo;t in the spots they&rsquo;re as good at - which is kudos to the Celtics D and gameplan but has nothing to do with Luka</p>

<p>Last year, the Thunder hit 40% on threes as a team and the only way we stopped them was ignoring Giddey who is now gone and replaced by a much better defender and shooter.</p>

<p>And I absolutely hate the Thunder. I don&rsquo;t like any of them except maybe JWill and the new guys, I have no strong feelings towards them. So I&rsquo;m not biased in the Thunder&rsquo;s favor.</p>

<p>Caruso is literally known for his defense on bigger wings than smaller guards lmao. It’s not even like either Brown or Tatum were dominant offensively in the Finals even against PJ and DJJ.</p>

      <label for="ln2s5c7" class="commentText"><p>I agree, I don&rsquo;t see how DJJ is a better defender than JWill on Brown physically. And either way, the Mavs struggled on offense because no one could hit shots. The Thunder shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with that cause they should be a top 3 three point shooting team again.</p>

<p>Defensively, we kept the Celtics to the lowest points of all their playoff opponents. And that includes them targeting injured Luka and Kyrie on offense. Who are they gonna target on the Thunder? Caruso or SGA? Good luck with that, especially with Dort and Chet helping.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="ln37qg6" class="commentText"><p>so looking at last year there were some evident statistical trends for when the Celtics lost</p>

<ol>
<li><p>12 out of 21 Celtics losses featured the opponent making at least 15 3s or shooting at least 40% from deep as a team. however, the Celtics record when the opponent made 15+ 3s last season was still 20-12 overall, and 17-12 when the opponent shot 40% or better from 3, so shooting well alone is not enough.</p></li>

<li><p>Celtics had a dead even 14-14 record when shooting 33.3% or worse from 3 as a team. 6 of those Ls featured the opponent knocking down 15+ 3s while 7 featured the opponent shooting 40% or better from 3. 12 of 21 Celtics losses also featured Boston making less than 15 3s (overall record of 17-12)</p></li>

<li><p>Celtics gave up 10 or more offensive rebounds in 14 out of 21 losses. but when giving up 10+ offensive rebounds their record was still 41-14</p></li>

<li><p>Celtics turned it over 12+ times in 15 out of 21 losses but still had a 35-15 record when turning the ball over 12+ times. 11 of 21 Celtics losses featured the opponent turning it over 10 times or less (37-11 overall)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>in terms of personnel you obviously need shooting. you also want guys with size and length who can match up with the Jays on the perimeter, but defensively if you have any player that’s a defensive weak link the Celtics will find them and exploit them relentlessly; since any guy on the floor can set a screen for PnR there’s just no hiding your bad defenders against them. you need guys who can hold their own against the dribble and rotate crisply</p>

<p>so basically the most important thing is 3P shooting. 15 appears to be the magic number - you need to make at least 15 3s on great efficiency while limiting the Celtics to less than 15 3s on poor efficiency. it’s also important to grab offensive rebounds, force turnovers and take care of the ball to maximize your own possessions and limit Boston’s. and you need to have a lineup with the size and length to guard the Jays, as well as switch multiple positions</p>

<p>based on this I’d say the team that best matches up is the <strong>Thunder.</strong> last year they were the most efficient 3P shooting team in the league, one of the best teams at forcing turnovers and one of the better teams at avoiding turnovers themselves. they were a bad rebounding team, but the addition of Hartenstein projects to help them out a lot in that department. they have plenty of quality perimeter defenders in Dort, JDub, Caruso, Wiggins and Wallace (though those guys are generally a bit lacking in length) and their starting 5 won’t have any defensive weak links. and as far as the KP conundrum, not many guys you’d take to guard him over Chet Holmgren</p>

<p>in the East I’d say the <strong>Knicks.</strong> they have several good 3P shooters, they love attacking the offensive glass, and they have two of the best wing defenders in the game. but the loss of Hartenstein definitely could hurt them in the rebounding department and with Brunson as their best player Boston will have a clear target on every single possession; I’m also not very high on Randle as a second option as he is a turnover machine and you really have to take care of the rock against Boston</p>

      <label for="ln4guki" class="commentText"><p>A Thunder-Celtics series would be fun as hell, since the Thunder seem to be emulating the Celtics’ roster building. It’s obviously not exact, but they’ve both surrounded their central star (Tatum/SGA) with similar pieces. JDub/Jaylen Brown, Chet/Porzingis, Wallace/Jrue, Caruso/White, Joe/Hauser.</p>

<p>Not saying the Thunder’s individual players are all as good as the Celtics’, but they’re similar types of players. Hartenstein apparently wants to get back to shooting 3s, so they might be hoping he’s Horford. Very similar roster building strategies.</p>

      <label for="ln2bkk0" class="commentText"><p>As a Celtics fan, I expect the Knicks, Pacers, and Magic to give Boston the hardest road back to the Finals. All are capable of winning a playoff series.</p>

<p>First, anyone saying Philly hasn’t paid attention to recent history.</p>

<p>Until proven otherwise, any MKE-BOS playoff matchup has the Jrue Holiday revenge factor that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>MIA is always a pain in the ass but they required massive shooting luck to beat the Celtics two years ago and the roster has stagnated or gotten worse. I suppose if Jimmy if healthy, it’s a series, but BOS should be heavily favored.</p>

<p>Those are good teams but they don’t matchup with BOS well and will lose a playoff series.</p>

<p>The Knicks have great perimeter defenders but have a size problem against BOS. However, the potential Achilles Heel of the Celtics is the health of Porzingis and Horford. Assuming a playoff series with no KP and no Mitchell Robinson (because Thibs has broken that guy already), the Knicks will be competitive.</p>

<p>The Pacers boneheadedly threw away two games in the ECF last year and Haliburton wasn’t healthy. Their mix of pace, shooting, and defense can make the Celtics work, hard.</p>

<p>The Magic have given the Celtics problems for years, because they are very long and very defensively focused.</p>

      <label for="ln320xq" class="commentText"><p>Sigh. Jrue Holiday is one of the best on-ball defenders in the League and will be somewhat motivated to “go off” defensively against the guy he was literally traded for.</p>

<p>Also, Lopez and Middleton are ancient and injured. Milwaukee’s window closed before they swapped Jrue for Dame but that trade made Boston a title winner and Milwaukee a defensive cupcake.</p>

<p>Milwaukee matches up terribly with the Celtics, now. And Jrue Holiday is the (defensive) reason.</p>

<p>We’ve jettisoned Tobias Harris, and some key players will now have had a few seasons to gel with Dr nick nurse’s system. To say nothing of the trades themselves. There’s just way too much that’s different than to write them off outright. Fuckin James harden left, no one was around to replace him, and we <em>still</em> had a commendable season.</p>

They had no chance running with us and closing out our shooters. They were left behind from go. If they struggled with the Celtics speed? Yeah they&rsquo;d be doomed.</p>

<p>They’re a first round exit if they actually played healthy teams lol. They lost to both the bucks and the Knicks if they weren’t injured and then they got swept in the conference finals</p>

<p>Sure it was a “competitive sweep” but they don’t even make it past the first round without insane injury luck</p>

They aren’t over reliant on their guard to run their offense, it’s more like an overgrown cherry on top. Halliburton is obviously an amazing engine but the Pacers whole schtick is that their play style is meant to reduce the severe talent gap and turn every game into a knife fight. They’re good because their play style is extremely volatile. It’s a game to see which team breaks first. The Hawks put every egg in one basket and prayed with their whole game plan relying on a Trae iso or pnr</p>

The Knicks are a better team when healthy but the whole Good Luck Brunson approach in 4th quarters against the Celtics isn’t gonna get them anywhere. The Bucks and Philly have the best player on the floor but Bucks and Miami are old and Philly has questionable health. Orlando can replicate the run and gun style Pacers have but they don’t have the cherry on top in Hali. I wouldn’t be surprised if they go back to the ECF again and I wouldn’t be surprised if they get bounced in the first round either but by all means, they can run every team to the ground just as fast as they can do it to themselves</p>

<p>Dame is great no question, but asking him to be his 100% against Jrue Holiday and Derrick White is not fair to anyone in the league tbh, and even if they&rsquo;re trying Lopez/Giannis pick and rolls he&rsquo;s just getting Tatum or Brown on him which are another 2 of the best defenders in the league. It&rsquo;s just a tough ask for any guard to over perform against the current Celtics.</p>

      <label for="ln3xq3q" class="commentText"><p>I think there are a few Western teams that could match up pretty well. Nuggets and Wolves have the personnel and talent imo. I think the Thunder are built really well for Boston too. I think in the East, the Knicks have the best shot. I&rsquo;m biased but the moves made were definitely made with Boston in mind. More versatility offensively and defensively at the cost of some size/big man depth.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how Philly and Milwaukee look this season. They could cause them some trouble with their superstar big and strong supporting cast.</p>

<p>I think Boston will (and should) be the favorites this season. KP is the game changer for them. They had so much success without him last season. With him, they&rsquo;re even more of a match up problem for the league.</p>

      <label for="ln42vxw" class="commentText"><p>Here’s their real advantage: the Celtics dominate in the east and basically have a cakewalk to the finals if they just hold it together. Meanwhile, so many worthy contenders battle each other in the west, jockeying for position all year and fighting fierce playoff battles up until the finals, significantly weakening them by the time they have to face the lone eastern juggernaut. I never hear anyone talk about this, but this is why it was so dumb for everyone (east or west) to give Boston so many favorable trades the last few years.</p>

      <label for="ln54n6b" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t see any real threats. Knicks are deep but Brunson is great but we have great defenders for guards. Randle is pretty good but inconsistent. And I know every one is excited about them but the rest of their players would be the sixth best Celtics or worse. Pacers maybe. If we have a major injury or something. And in the west only team I see as a tough finals matchup is the timberwolves of KP is injured or Horford slows way down which he may. Maybe the thunder. They are a young team but now have some decent playoff experience. Again if KP is injured or Horford slows way down Chet could give us some issues. I would say we are the clear favorites</p>

      <label for="ln2pxsy" class="commentText"><p>The issue most teams run into is not having the personnel to guard 5 out. Even the nuggets don’t have the personnel but we got unlucky against them since we decided to shoot like shit from 3 both games and Jokic went off offensively. A lot of the Celtics possessions look the same and it doesn’t really matter what personnel you have out there if you play a center. It’s going to be dribble drive into dribble drive into dribble drive until someone is open for a 3 assuming one of the 5 people driving doesn’t just get to the basket. I’d go with the thunder if I had to pick a team. Respectfully jwill and dort aren’t going to lock up brown and Tatum though. People think you can just stick any decent wing defender on them. That’s just now how it works at all since both of these guys are elite at getting to and finishing at the rim.</p>

      <label for="ln29mtn" class="commentText"><p>Probably Philly (if healthy), Denver or the Lakers (if Healthy, add players, and AD is a beast again in the playoffs) are the most likely.</p>

<p>I think it will have to be a team with a true big target that troubles KP and an aging Horford, and is big enough that none of the (now 3) J&rsquo;s can switch up to them. Maybe Giannis could also be that type of player for the Bucks as well, but I think Boston&rsquo;s at least can do a better job against him the other 3 guys.</p>

<p>Now do any of those teams have a true 4-5 man defence that could stop the Celtics if everything is flowing well? Probably not. But I think if you break down Boston&rsquo;s defence then that goes a long way.</p>

<p>Boston do deserve to be favourites. But I wouldn&rsquo;t consider them outright favourites against the field. There&rsquo;s a whole season and 4 playoff series&rsquo; to play. A lot can develop in that time.</p>

<p>In the West, Denver still matches up well with Boston, but I don&rsquo;t see them getting to the finals. OKC I&rsquo;m not sure, they clearly can guard Boston, but I have to see J-Dub and Chet being able to score efficiently vs a tough switching defense to be convinced.</p>

      <label for="ln28ucb" class="commentText"><p>Jokic. Embiid. Giannis. Those three guys could beat Boston in the playoffs. Lakers. Minny. Basically any team with size and defense and/or a dominant big can beat them.</p>

<p>And then the Heat and Warriors are dark horses here. They’ve had Boston’s number the past few seasons despite being clearly outmatched.</p>

      <label for="ln2afhk" class="commentText"><p>Lakers are a good defensive team with size and length and a league best whistle. They beat a fully healthy Celtics without Bron and AD last season.</p>

<p>Embiid, it really just depends on his personal health. With Maxey taking a huge leap, and Paul George providing some spark plug scoring/shooting, 76ers can be a threat now.</p>

<p>Neither team would be my first choice for a Celtic stopper but they can definitely compete against them for sure.</p>

      <label for="ln2aopz" class="commentText"><p>This is the team that&rsquo;s the best matchup. The lakers win was clearly the Celtics letting their guard down with players sitting.</p>

<p>In the last few years the teams that play the best against Boston have scoring bigs and very good defensive wings. The Lakers are a good defensive team but their wing defense has been pretty bad. They also play slow as hell which falls into what Boston does defensively</p>

<p>Were talking about the best team in basketball. And the lakers are mid.</p>
