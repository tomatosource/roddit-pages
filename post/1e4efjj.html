<blockquote>
<p>What I have picked up is the Warriors and Jazz have had continued conversations [about Markkanen].</p>

<p>The Jazz wouldn’t be thinking about moving Lauri Markkanen if this were a team that’s trying to compete, but this is obviously a team that’s going down more of a rebuilding path.</p>

<p>And if you’re going to rebuild and you’re trying to compete — not for a playoff berth, but probably for the number one overall pick— you have to consider it.</p>

<p>The Jazz don’t want to trade Lauri Markkanen, but if the Warriors want to put in a Brandin Podziemski, and — from what I’m told — 3 first round picks, 3-4 unprotected pick swaps, 3-4 second round picks…</p>

<p>Kuminga’s a name, but I’m told the Jazz are more focused on Podziemski: Him being included in the deal, those picks being included in the deal.</p>

<p>From the Warrior’s perspective, it’s Podziemski but not all the picks. And if it’s all the picks, then there’s not going to be a Podziemski.</p>

Took JB over 2 other guys that were viewed above him(dunn and bender). Traded the 1st overall to get a 1st + take tatum which is the guy he wanted all along. The first overall will either not play this year or play for a vetmin. He traded IT who never really played again for Kyrie(obviously that didn&rsquo;t end up working but up to that point kyrie had only been on one team). Like what a dumb take, how is your comment getting upvoted. The celtics just won a championship off his work and brad&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>“Danny Ainge has an insane asking price for trading away his player!”</p>

<p>“Danny Ainge almost made a trade for XXX player but decided not to at the last minute”</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it’s an intentional strategy to utilize the media in this way from Ainge but we’ve seen it enough already that it shouldn’t surprise people either way. I guess it is fun to overreact in the comments though.</p>

<p>These are the only reports that annoy me. He always seems to leak that he was totally about to draft the best player in the draft or make a trade for someone who became a star. And it&rsquo;s always a couple years later once we&rsquo;ve seen the outcome. Lol</p>

Also, the talk from a lot of the commentators has been that Lauri, after a contract extension, almost certainly has more trade value than Lauri on a cheap but expiring deal.</p>

<p>The return for Lauri is a huge part of this. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to hyperfixate on moving from 6% to 10% in the lottery and have a firesale.</p>

Same reason there were a ton of Shai rumors before OKC broke out. People don’t like to accept it, but the idea that all good players should play for bigger markets/more popular teams is definitely there.</p>

<p>I think if you look at the Jazz roster and think the only way for them to get to a top 5 pick is by trading Lauri, we just disagree. Move a vet or 2, keep Lauri on the team and I’d still project them a bottom 5 pick.</p>

<p>If the Jazz think that’s a possibility, there’s no way they’re selling Lauri for anything less than a haul. </p>

Mitchell got even better admittedly- better passing n defending , but even then nobody expected Lauri to get an all star n mip neither did Utah from all reports . I think considering that cavs got Mitchell on a good value trade imo .  Especially now he extended and improved they could easily move him for more</p>

      <label for="ldemezs" class="commentText"><p>Idk man I feel fine.</p>

<p>It’s honestly kind of annoying how everyone outside of jazz fans think we HAVE to trade Lauri when we really don’t.</p>

<p>We were 5-25 to end the season. I think we were 1-12 when Lauri was playing. We will not be good with him anyways so I don’t know why everyone thinks we’re gonna be the 9th or 10th pick. There’s also a salary floor to worry about.</p>

<p>Let’s keep in mind, the worst record in the league got the pistons the 5th pick two years in a row. How would you sell it to the fans that we traded a great player who wanted to stay here and didn’t even end up with a top pick? There’s a real chance that happens.</p>

<p>If we do trade Lauri and do get a good pick, and are truly awful, we still won’t be ready to compete for like 2 or 3 years after because of how young this roster would be.</p>

<p>Then that superstar we signed will probably start wanting out of Utah because no one wants to play in Utah, and we stay forever bad.</p>

<p>Also can we all stop talking about how Lauri’s gonna walk, or how trading for him is a rental? Stars don’t test free agency nearly as often anymore. The team acquiring him, or us keeping him, can offer the most money. Do you not think Lauri would not just take the most money offered, which he can get by extending? That’s what most players do</p>

<p>I swear people saying he’s a rental forget that the most likely outcome if the warriors trade for Lauri is that he extends with them on August 6th. Then those picks don’t look to good.</p>

Even though it&rsquo;s built around mid 30s players on the decline, and the picks would likely be up to 7 years from now?</p>

      <label for="ldeqcmd" class="commentText"><p>Jazz reporters have stated for months that Lauri wants to stay in Utah, and believes in what the front office is doing.I am simply going off what has been reported by expecting him to extend if we do not trade him</p>

<p>If he likes Utah, plus we can offer him the most money, he will probably extend.</p>

<p>The Jazz have said for months that we need to be blown away by a trade offer in order to trade Lauri, because he wants to stay. It’s more being prudent about listening to offers since we cannot extend him until August 6th.</p>

<p>This is just the Jazz doing what they have publicly stated since the trade deadline last season.</p>

<p>These offers are not blow me away type of deals. The warriors pick in 2025, if they have Lauri, will not be good. The pick swap in 2026 would likely have the Jazz keep their own pick as well. And I do not think the plan is for the Jazz to be awful until 2027, so it’s just not good enough.</p>

<p>I imagine if he wants out, we will trade him for less. But him straight walking seems as if it is just not going to happen, as seemingly every Jazz reporter in the know mostly states.</p>

      <label for="ldezaom" class="commentText"><p>Honestly the narrative is crazy. To be honest, while Lauri has undoubtedly been our best player the past two years, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s been the biggest floor raiser if that makes sense. Mainly because he&rsquo;s not a self creator. He thrives best when paired with a guard who can create for the team. To that end, I think Conley deserves most of the credit for our winning in the first season of the rebuild and after we traded. Even last season we started really poorly and didn&rsquo;t go on a winning streak until we moved sexton and Dunn into the starting lineup. If the jazz can move off sexton, and maybe one or both JCs as well, and then just play Lauri and a bunch of young guys, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll have any trouble losing games.</p>

<p>Best they can do is a young low level All Star like Lauri. And even those guys don’t pop up very often. Market price is just really high for trades like this. Three firsts, a couple swaps, and Podz or Kuminga is probably pretty on market.</p>

<p>So whether it’s Lauri or somebody else on the same level, that’s going to be the cost. Not worth it in a vacuum, but do you really want to waste Steph’s last couple years?</p>

<p>To put it another way - if you won’t make a deal like this, you probably need to trade Steph and rebuild.</p>

We have literally zero chance of any star players ever coming here in FA. The only chance we will ever have is to get lucky in drafting and develop stars ourselves, then hope things come together before they inevitably want out. We got really close with Stockton and Malone. We got fairly close with Donovan and Rudy. We just have to try again.</p>

      <label for="ldfonpq" class="commentText"><p>Podz is a young player who has proven to some degree that he is a contributor at the NBA level who has room to grow and is cheap for 3 more years. That alone is worth much more than multiple picks years down the road. Will he be a star? Who knows, but he already has an exponentially greater chance of being so than any future pick can be predicted to be solely on him showing that he is already a legit NBA player.</p>

<p>When you trade a player the caliber of Lauri, you cant have the bulk of your return just be the draft picks. They&rsquo;re obviously important and nice to have, but they&rsquo;re lottery tickets at the end of the day. Good to have as a supplement, but they can&rsquo;t be what you hope to pay your bills with. You need to get back something that you at least know has some level of value. All the picks OKC got for PG are secondary to the fact that they got a young building block in SGA who happened to develop into an MVP candidate. Now am I saying Podz will end up developing like that? Not at all, but lets not act like anyone thought SGA would end up being that good either. He was very good as a rookie but its not like he was playing at even a star level then.</p>

<p>Even if Podz maxes out as just a high level role player (which is very possible), the chances of any future pick being even that good is slim. Hell, like I said, even the level Podz is at now is something most draft picks will never reach, so better to get a guy like that while he&rsquo;s still super young and can develop into something greater.</p>

It isn’t like they can go get a star in return, all they can look for is young guys with potential or picks.

<p>Now they act insulted Danny won’t accept their offers when literally nothing has changed except they feel more and more entitled to our best player.  They should just move on and trade for Zach Lavine or something.  This all reminds me of Knicks fans telling us we had no choice but to trade Mitchell to them….</p>

<p>Of all the bad teams in the league, Jazz got one of the better rosters right now in my opinion. They have a legit big rotation, and some talented guards. They have athleticism, size and shooting and just depth on each position basically. I feel like there&rsquo;s zero chance they are worse than teams like Bulls, Nets, Hornets, Blazers, Wizards and the Pistons for example. Then we have teams like the Raptors and the Spurs who have solid pieces but not really a full squad, who might also be tanking.</p>

      <label for="ldec0rw" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m gonna roll with what the Jazz beat writers have been saying all along with Lauri, that it would take an absolute home run to see him moved, and with reports of he and Jazz FO members already in negotiations re: an extension it sure seems like the Warriors don&rsquo;t have a ton of time on their hands. If August 6th is the date to circle on the calendar, that&rsquo;s three weeks to figure it out.</p>

<p>The fact there are any discussions at all does mean the Jazz can be had, though. It&rsquo;s just gonna be at their price, and they don&rsquo;t really have to move him. They have to be forced to do so.</p>

<p>Warriors seem to trust Kuminga and Podz enough to roll with them and not sell the farm for Lauri. If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s a risky bet, but we&rsquo;ll see if it pays off. But they also know Steph and Dray are winding down. Whatever window that&rsquo;s left is closing. You can say they almost owe it to those two to make a move for Lauri.</p>

And in reverse we’re the first team to truly realize Lauri’s potential so he may appreciate the opportunities we’ve given him.  We’re not obligated to trade him just to be as dogshit as possible just like the Kings didn’t trade Fox when he was outperforming the rest of the pre-playoff level Kings.  You also have to remember the Jazz still have to also sell seats to games, this isn’t 2K.  It’s still a business that needs revenue.</p>

<p>I also think people are overrating how good the Jazz will actually be next year.  Our roster is almost half made of first or second year guys.  The only team worse than us in the west would probably be the Blazers.</p>

<p>Good question, I’ve got no idea, but it doesn’t seem he’s asked out yet. There’s always the possibility he’s <em>quietly</em> asked out, but I would think Ainge would be taking these trade talks more seriously if so. It seems the Jazz are pretty certain that Lauri will accept an extension.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It could be Ainge being Ainge and wanting to hold out until the deadline where some team will get <em>really</em> desperate, but I think the Jazz owner is a problem too.</p>

<p>The owner seems to care about profit over competing, straight up. It was his idea for the Jazz to go “big game hunting” in free agency this offseason. Even though that plan didn’t work, he wants stars to help fill seats now. He already seems tired of rebuilding even though they never actually bottomed out. I’m hoping he changes his tune and lets Ainge cook unhindered, meddling owners are the worst thing a team can have. Then again, Ainge gets in his own way a lot too so it’s pretty rough either way lol</p>

OKC, MInne, and Dallas all took 4 years to finally contend after getting their stars. Lauri is gonna be at the end of his contract and <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>31</sub> by the time yall can compete. Which is why keeping him doesnt make sense to alot of fans.</p>
