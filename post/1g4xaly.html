</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It seems like every year, teams draft or sign super young guys with obvious physical upside, only to stash them in the G-League with the idea of developing their basketball skills.</p>

<p>But, like, how many of these guys ever actually develop?</p>

<p>Are there examples of guys who were drafted young, and were nowhere near NBA-ready in year one, but thrived after a year as an NBA redshirt or in a G-League development environment and eventually reached their ceiling?</p>

<p>It seems like even the classic names who seemingly come out of nowhere at least start out as playable NBA players in year one.</p>

      <label for="ls6y1hn" class="commentText"><p>I’m a Wolves fan, so I only know Rudy as the best defensive player in the league. Since you’re a Jazz fan, maybe you’d know better: Looking at his stats, it looks like his productivity is more or less tied to his minutes, and it took 3 years to get 30+ minutes of burn. </p>

<p>Was he a bad player who got better, or did he just need an opportunity? </p>

He wasn&rsquo;t very strong, not nearly as mobile as he is now, didn&rsquo;t understand defensive positioning, was actually bad at catching and dunking instead of just looking goofy at it, was a mediocre screener, and fouled ALL the time.</p>

      <label for="ls6r8nh" class="commentText"><p>Just from the Spurs POV, if you include stash in Europe, then guys like Manu, Scola, and Splitter fit the bill.</p>

<p>If you mean guys who needed time in the G League specifically, then guys like Danny Green, Dejounte Murray and even Derrick White (was a matured aged draftee, but had come from a veeeery long way back through his college journey, and then still needed basically a full year in Austin to become an NBA level role player.</p>

<p>Looking elsewhere, I would point to Jermaine O&rsquo;Neal as the most obvious example. This was pre G-league (and even D-League), and was drafted as a high schooler, but basically spent 4 years in Portland doing absolutely nothing. Before very quickly becoming an All-NBA and perennial All Star in Indy.</p>

<p>Tony was <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> his first season, then <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> his next two seasons, then started coming into his own by developing his floater and layup bag in his 4th and 5th seasons.</p>

      <label for="ls7wqvy" class="commentText"><p>Oh yeah, Antonio Daniels was never really seen as the future starting PG, especially not by the time Parker was drafted. He was picked top 4 then they traded him for our late first pick the following year. He was really brought in to be a 6th man type combo guard off the bench, but really couldn&rsquo;t even do that well. Avery was washed and Antonio couldn&rsquo;t handle being a starter.</p>

<p>Spurs struggled at PG basically every single year from the time they let Rod Strickland walk after the around the back pass against Portland to the time Parker came into his own with the teardrop floater in about 04/05.</p>

      <label for="ls7kla4" class="commentText"><p>Lance Stephenson comes to mind. Despite being &ldquo;Born Ready,&rdquo; he entered the NBA as a pretty substantial project. The Pacers let him incubate for a couple years before introducing him to the mix.</p>

<p>Gerald Green took a circuitous route from Top 20 pick straight out of high school to productive NBA player. I don&rsquo;t think he fits the M.O. here necessarily, but I would definitely say he fits the spirit of the exercise.</p>

<p>As some have mentioned, Jermaine O&rsquo;Neal is probably an example. Zach Randolph as well.</p>

<p>Usually, when guys are described as a pretty big project, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not presently particularly good at basketball, which makes it more of an uphill climb. The ones who pan out probably make those initial strides earlier, a la Giannis and Siakam.</p>

<p>Always flashed but still had to learn the game. Basically red shirted behind Rasheed Wallace. He never cracked 15mpg in his first 4 seasons</p>

<p>Even after he left to Indiana it took him a year to become the dominant big man that he was</p>

<p>Then year 6, he basically becomes a 20-10 guy with 2+ blocks a game for 6 years</p>

<p>He was a steal for the Nuggets based on where they were able to draft him.  He had top talent, but was a couple years away based on back injuries and other developments.</p>

<p>That is a rare example of where the patience paid off.</p>

<p>Now he is grossly overpaid though, but that is another topic 😂</p>
