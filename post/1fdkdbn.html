      <label for="lmgdhwj" class="commentText"><p>He’s way up there for me on my list of “bonafide all-time legends who are still somehow underrated.”</p>

<p>One of the best and most underappreciated things about Oscar is just how efficient he was in his era, especially on that volume.</p>

<p>He’s a lot like exactly Wilt in that way. People don’t appreciate just how efficient they were. They generally shot the most but were also a whole lot more accurate than others especially from the field (Oscar was also, unlike Wilt, an outstanding FT shooter).</p>

<p>From ‘60-61 to ‘69-70, Oscar came in 1st in TS% once, 2nd seven times, and 3rd twice, league-wide.</p>

      <label for="lmgfmda" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily say that HE is underrated, I think he just gets lumped in with the &ldquo;inflated stats&rdquo; of that era. Mainly, it was the fastest pace and highest scoring era (raw, not adjusted for pace) because of that. There were a lot more points, rebounds, and assists to share back then.</p>

<p>Granted, he was the only one to average a triple double for a season <del>(and did it multiple times)</del> until Westbrook, so that is still impressive. It&rsquo;s just that stats from that era aren&rsquo;t as impressive (to people) compared to if those stats were to happen in, say, the pace of the 90s-00&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="lmggj73" class="commentText"><p>The pace is a major factor which is also why even Wilt is often discounted, but that’s also why I think bringing up scoring efficiency here is critical.</p>

<p>Oscar wasn’t just chucking up shots every time down the floor sometimes with no rhyme or reason, which to some extent was the play style back then (Jerry West himself has talked about this).</p>

<p>Oscar was ahead of his time in playing within his (extraordinarily high) means. He was a triple double machine but a very controlled one. For his volume he was the most efficient scorer in the entire league for a decade straight, regardless of position (and of course without a 3 point line).</p>

<p>Like seriously, ring culture changed the common all time lists. Started with Lebron vs Kobe when lebron was statistically beating kobe in every category and people say rings to say kobe is better. Now that it moved to lebron vs jordan&rsquo;s rings. Now it has become the norm in ranking. Shaq also being a major rings person in mainstream media didnt help plus he is probably the most known basketball player after kobe, lebron and Mj.</p>

<p>Back in the 2000s, a top 10 list without Karl Malone is heresy. Now, people know him more for his youthful escapades. Same with chuck, dude was the first person to retire top 100 in all 5 categories and now is barely top 20 in most lists. Hakeen used to be rated higher than TD and now TD is cloer to top 5 than to Hakeem. Moses Malone was close or in the top 10 and is now forgotten.</p>

<p>Unless you have at least 4 rings, you are out of the top 10. So yeah, ring culture being bought to mainstream media is one of the most unintentionally evil things lebron has done.</p>

Kareem was pretty low on list back in 2000s for some reason. Hakeem was also lower back then. Russel wasnt that high in the lists either. Wilt was in goat consideration. Jerry west was top 5.</p>

<p>Lately, kareem(deservely) is now top 3. Hakeem is fighting steph for top 10. Russel is firmly top 10. Wilt is like top 5 but never top 3. Jerry west i barely top 20</p>

<p>Like Big O and the two Malones were consistenly higher than kareem, hakeem and Russel. Now they barely make the lists.</p>

      <label for="lmhnxev" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, I think a lot of it is because of Westbrook. Regardless of your opinion of Russ, he averaged a triple double 4 times, including a 30-point triple double in his MVP season. Apart from Oscar, no one had even averaged 9+/9+/9+ other than one Magic season where he didn&rsquo;t average 10 rebounds or assists. Another Magic season was the only season in which someone averaged a double double with at least 8 of a third stat (until Harden did so the same season Russ averaged a triple double). Once Russ did it a few times, the mythos surrounding the triple double average kind of went away. Especially now that others have gotten really close.</p>

      <label for="lmgjbh7" class="commentText"><p>He was overlooked far before that. He went from GOAT talks to only being known for his triple double season well before Russ&rsquo;s mvp season.</p>

<p>The reason that he&rsquo;s overlooked is because the team that he&rsquo;s most associated with doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore. A big part of maintaining older player legacies comes from current fans of the teams they played for since those players are a part of the history of the fans&rsquo; favorite teams. But you cant do that with Oscar because there are no Cincinnati Royals fans anymore to bring him up. Moses malone isn&rsquo;t brought up as much for a similar reason, in that he doesn&rsquo;t really have a &ldquo;home team&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lmgoc7y" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. Another part that limits Big O’s legacy is he was an asshole. To the press especially. So they didn’t cover him or covered him negatively. Bill Simmons goes into it in detail in his <em>Book of Basketball</em>.</p>

      <label for="lmgpicg" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s definitely overlooked. Especially because Thomas and Stockton are overrated by most people. Neither of them is in the same convo as Steph or Magic. Or Nash or Paul for that matter. Robertson absolutely should be though.</p>

<p>ETA: Thomas had a short peak, never finished higher than 5th in MVP voting, was only top 10 in MVP 3 times, and had a short lived career. He was All-NBA &ldquo;only&rdquo; 5 times and never made All-Defense. He had a HOF worthy career but he is not remotely the same caliber player as the players mentioned. Frankly, he&rsquo;s even below Stockton who I already called overrated.</p>

      <label for="lmhe60y" class="commentText"><p>What Russ did was very impressive, but I watched a lot of his games and it is clear that at times his stats come at the expense of team success.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, he has contributed to way more wins than losses. He&rsquo;s not selfish at all and I don&rsquo;t think for a second he was stat padding. It&rsquo;s just that his style of play and in-game choices have limited team offense in some ways.</p>

<p>I love the way his game has been evolving since he went to the clippers, particularly his defense, and Ty Lue absolutely knows how to work with Russel&rsquo;s strengths and limitations. No joke I believe when fully healthy the clippers were the best team in the league the last two years. Few ringless players (all time) deserve one more than Russ, but his window is my team&rsquo;s window so I won&rsquo;t be rooting for that. :)</p>

<p>As for Oscar, he may have had some limits like Russ, but that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff you only can get a grasp of by watching games and I am not going to watch grainy 1960&rsquo;s basketball archives anytime soon.</p>

      <label for="lmhp4yk" class="commentText"><p>OKC was 100-22 when Russ got a triple double in OKC. Team success was based largely on how well Russ played. When he played like a god, which he did often, he dragged that <sup>2016</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> team to wins. When he played even a bit below MVP level, the team stuggled to win against even middling teams. As I&rsquo;ve said elsewhere, his playstyle isn&rsquo;t what caused OKC to lose games. It was inefficient shooting. It&rsquo;s hard for me to tie &ldquo;stood in the right position for rebounds&rdquo; to inefficient shooting.</p>

<p>Give me the 30 best teams from California over the best 8 best teams from Rhode Island, it&rsquo;s the most basic understanding of statistics. That&rsquo;s not to say Wilt or Bill couldn&rsquo;t make it in today&rsquo;s game but to pretend the competition was anywhere near equal to today is complete make believe.</p>

<p>Same reason you had English guys in the late 1800s, early 1900s that were top level in half a dozen sports, C B Fry was a top footballer, cricketer, rugby player and Long Jump World Record holder, because there was like 10,000 guys that could afford to participate in these sports.</p>

Look at how much Lebron supposedly spends maintaining his body, is anyone really going to argue that someone from the 60s is anywhere close? The game and understanding of the game has also greatly evolved. This isn’t saying those greats couldn’t play in this league if they were born now, and raised on what we have, but there’s a world of difference between nba basketball today and then.</p>

So, my guess is in 20 or 30 years this record will not only be broken, but destroyed. Which is a great thing btw! Its exciting to watch the league grow and really nice to see the momentum didn&rsquo;t completely die from the caitlin clark thing. All the league needs now is another couple caitlin clarks and to have a magic vs bird situation thats super marketable and then i bet a female MJ comes along and takes it to another level!</p>

      <label for="lmgh4qi" class="commentText"><p>Back when guys spent 4 years in college? Totally</p>

<p>Wilt won MVP as a rookie</p>

<p>Kareem put up 29/15/4(they didn&rsquo;t count blocks and steals yet), finished 3rd in MVP, All-NBA 2nd team, All-Defense 2nd team, and improved the Bucks by 29 wins</p>

<p>Oscar averaged 31/10/10 and was All-NBA 1st team</p>

<p>Magic was FMVP and famously closed out the series jumping at C and dropping 42/15/7/3/1</p>

<p>Magic wasn&rsquo;t even ROTY, that honor went to Bird who improved the Celtics from 29 wins to 61, was All-NBA 1st team, and 4th in the MVP race</p>

<p>MJ averaged 28/7/6 with 2.4spg on TS+ of 109 as a rookie</p>

<p>Tim Duncan was All-NBA 1st team, All-Defense 2nd, and got votes for MVP and DPOY</p>

<p>The list goes on. Spending 4 years in college vs being an 18 or 19y/o makes a world of difference. In what would&rsquo;ve been LeBron&rsquo;s junior year of college he was a runner-up MVP, in what would&rsquo;ve been his senior year of college he carried a bum Cavs team to the Finals. He accomplished all that by the time he would&rsquo;ve graduated.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t putting CC down at all, her post-break run is reminiscent of the greats who also spent multiple years in college. You just need a more historical perspective to look at a question like this.</p>

      <label for="lmgttmo" class="commentText"><p>Clark actually plays more than the vast majority of NBA starters. She&rsquo;d be just outside the top 10 in minutes per game. Based on percent of game played, the amount Clark plays is like an NBA player playing 43 minutes a game. It&rsquo;s not that surprising that it hasn&rsquo;t been done it 6 times to me though. The WNBA career leader for assists per game is like 6.7. WNBA teams pretty much never play through the point guard. Also the WNBA season is half as long. I can&rsquo;t think of a player besides Clark that&rsquo;s been asked to be a team&rsquo;s top scorer and facilitator.</p>

<p>Look SVP, reality is coming. There’s levels to this thing. And that’s just life. We all went through it. You see it on the NBA side, and you’re going to see it on this side. You look superhuman playing against 18-year-olds, but you’re going to play some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time. Not saying her skills are not gonna translate, because when you’re great at what you do, you’re just gonna get better. But there is gonna be a transition period where you’re gonna have to give yourself some grace as a rookie.</p>

<p>All she said was that Clark might not be a superstar immediately, which was pretty much true, and she has been <a href="https://x.com/DesertWaveCo/status/1807538328201572728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1807538328201572728%7Ctwgr%5E1e0c959404cc5cd6636bb05f739df8acf315b0d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Fwnba%2Fdiana-taurasi-classy-quote-caitlin-clark-mercury-fever" target="_blank">highly complimentary</a> of Clark otherwise.

      <label for="lmh6vi2" class="commentText"><p>That’s fair. The full quote adds a lot of context. I remember seeing a clip of this where her tone of voice implied a lot of skepticism re: Clark but it may have been incomplete and again your quote adds context. I’d be curious to look it up and see if I still felt the same way. I think what I said about girls targeting her is very true though.</p>

<p>And I think their feeling of “hey we’ve been here playing good ball this whole time - why does this girl suddenly  get all of the attention?” has some validity. But also holy shit the ticket sales Clark is bringing in had to be extremely good for the league and by extension, the players’ livelihood to some extent.</p>

<p>Wilt did it 32 times in his career. He did it 15 times in the &lsquo;61-&lsquo;62 season, and 6 in the month of February &lsquo;62 alone. He also did it 6 times in 9 games, a period spanning just 14 days (Feb 17-Mar 2, 1962).</p>

<p>EDIT: I was wrong on this, Wilt retired in the leagues 23rd season, he started in the leagues 10th season.</p>

      <label for="lmgejzz" class="commentText"><p>TBF Robinson played all 82 games while just 71. 319 blocks compared to 250 blocks. If Wemby did his season avg 3.6 bpg for those 11 games, he would land at 289 blocks, just 30 short. If he averaged his post all star break 4.5 bpg, he would land at 299, about 20 short.</p>

<p>Considering how different the game is from 1989 and Wemby playing far more on the perimeter, and defensive 3 seconds not being around in 1989, I still think it’s impressive compared to the Admiral rookie season because I don’t think we will see something like that again, 320+ blocks by a rookie</p>

<p>The way to look at Wemby&rsquo;s blocking really is that he had arguably the best shot-blocking season ever. iirc, he posted the highest BLK% of the last 40 seasons, and did it with the best ratio of blocks:foul in NBA history</p>

      <label for="lmgflh8" class="commentText"><p>I think what they were trying to say is that historically the center is the shot blocker position. It is their role to guard the rim and block shots. Other players block shots as well but they aren&rsquo;t getting as many opportunities to block shots. A lot of times their role is to funnel the player to the shot blocker. So what may be a more interesting stat is how he ranks just against other centers.</p>

      <label for="lmgfj7c" class="commentText"><p>I have no idea how impressive is 85%, but any starting center would probably have more blocks than conservatively 60% of all players all time because there are a lot of (non shot-blocking) guards and wings.</p>

<p>Wemby had 254 blocks last year, he already has more blocks than Chris Paul (200 career blocks) and if he keeps up the pace he would surpass James Harden (currently 600 career blocks at #232 all time) half way through his 3rd season. Is that impressive? I dunno but I do know Wemby blocks a lot of shots</p>

      <label for="lmgfj3q" class="commentText"><p>It is surprising it’s <em>that</em> low, but there’s a few factors, the biggest being 40 minute games and many fewer games per season. The other big one is that there just haven’t been a lot of distributors who put up big scoring numbers. I saw someone post on r/WNBA yesterday that point guards with high end scoring talent have typically been moved to shooting guard.</p>
