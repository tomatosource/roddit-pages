You have Nike, Adidas, Jordan, UA, NB, Skechers, Puma in the US market, then you have overseas competitors signing athletes as well. You kind of have to take a chance on players with that kind of talent or risk losing out. </p>

<p>I also don’t think he’s going to get a signature shoe quite yet, if it’s anything like Luka/Zion/Tatum he’ll get some Jordan apparel collections with the logo, a few signature colorways + logo on the newest general Jordan, and then maybe in a year or two if his brand grows/meets certain targets then they’ll make the Paolo 1. </p>

The players that got signature shoes back then were KD, Lebron, Kobe and Kyrie. Truly exclusive list of players. Then the 2nd tier went to adidas Harden, Rose, Dame. I don’t know why Nike feels like they need to go for volume over quality of player.</p>

<p>I mean that’s what I explained, if they waited until Paolo became that kind of player then he’s probably already signed with Adidas or something. Hell you have Cooper Flagg and Cameron Brink signing NB contracts before they’ve even played a professional game lol. Back in the era you said where it was KD, LeBron, Kobe, etc, the only real players in the basketball market were Nike/Jordan and Adidas. Competition in the market is directly causing this</p>

<p>So in my opinion.  Nike is trying to block other shoe brands from finding another Jordan or lebron.  Under armor got curry and it helped them tremendously to move up the ranks in sports apparel.  Nike doesn&rsquo;t want to miss out again after missing out on curry due to their own mistakes.</p>

<p>Secondly I’m not saying the dude isn’t great. I’m just saying that if  you could choose  4 players that could be on the Jordan brand, Paolo wouldn’t be one. He’s a second year player with not a lot of hype behind him.    Especially for a #1 overall pick. And that’s not just my opinion. The Magic Cavs series was an NBA Tv series cause they knew no one wanted to watch it, and the Magic don’t have A lot of nationally televised games.  If your argument is higher PPG for a young player, then I still go back to Ant.</p>

Several people compared him to LeBron and the hype around him nearly matched. If I’m not mistaken, I believe he got his shoe deal before he even played an NBA game. And for good reason.</p>

<p>Now has he lived up to his level of hype? When he’s not injured, yes. No matter how Zions career ends, signing him to the Jordan brand will always be considered the right thing to have done. He was a sure fire prospect with an electric game.</p>

<p>By the way, Zion in his career has played 184 of a possible 408 games. Also, outside of last postseason he has never been a factor at all. How’d they do this year? Swept in 4 by OKC btw! <em>Chefs Kiss</em></p>

<p>To put this this perspective, PB has played 152 games already entering year 3 with similar stat splits to Zion and about as much postseason success.</p>

<p>WE DO. Because the point of this argument is letting you know that he was SIGNED before he even played. He didn’t get signed yesterday. Then your argument would make sense. He got signed when his hype was at its maximum</p>

<p>As you said though, you&rsquo;re not a graphic designer. A team of graphic designers with considerable time spent on this project <em>should</em> be able to think of <em>something</em>. You&rsquo;re just one person trying to think of something for 5-10 seconds.</p>

<p>There are enough unique things about Paolo for them to come up with something better than this incredibly generic logo.</p>

<p>To be honest I had totally forgotten about the Rose logo.  It was well done but it died before it ever really got going.  Which goes to show it&rsquo;s ultimately the player that carries the brand, not the logo.</p>

<p>These days if you wait until a player is well-known enough to have kids lining up to buy their shoes, you’re too late and you’ve probably missed out on revenue to a competitor</p>

      <label for="lkits1c" class="commentText"><p>I agree with not being a fan, but what you said don’t just magically apply to every player.</p>

<p>MJ had iconic moves, what does Paolo have? Good player, but nobody flies and glides like MJ to bring out iconic logos like this.</p>

<p>And DRose literally is surnamed Rose. You cant play on anything with Paolo Banchero.</p>

      <label for="lkkq9b8" class="commentText"><p>Im capable of being objective. Anyone who’s into hoop shoes would agree that the logo was well thought out compared to the generic number and initials logo. It’s not “most people don’t know…” if you’re not into hoop shoes then sure you won’t know but if you are…you would. You can start your own thread and ask if you want</p>

But I&rsquo;ve watched the last two seasons enough to know that this is him looking sad, happy, grateful, ungrateful, pumped, sick, you name it. Dude just looks like this after making a huge dunk or eating a salad. Always like this. And we, Magic fans, learned to love it.</p>
