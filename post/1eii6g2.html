<p>He’s shown an ability to defend, specifically in the Denver series a year ago, yet came into this year and was the suns worst defensive starter, with a 18th percentile DPM according to craftednba, Beal a 30th percentile for reference. While Beal took on the challenge of guarding ant (unsuccessfully), book (unsuccessfully) hid on Conley, NAW, and McDaniels</p>

<p>He’s shown an ability to shoot 3s, yet he’s a career 35% 3 point shooter</p>

<p>The reality is he’s a really good player, that could be great if he rounded his game out more, with 2 of the more important and sought after skills in the nba</p>

      <label for="lg9gmgb" class="commentText"><p>Well guess what if his career average is 35%, and he has multiple season above that, then he must also have some below. Math.</p>

<p>Set aside your fandom for just a split second it’s really not that hard</p>

<p>His last 2 years have been 36 and 35% at 6 attempts per game. Donavan Mitchell has shot 37 and 38% on 9 attempts the last 2 years. That’s 50% more attempts per game from what almost everyone would say is an inferior jump shooter.</p>

<p>He’s capable of more 3s per game simple as that . Suns fans are constantly asking him and Kd (a 40% 3 point shooter last year and career 38.7%) to shoot more 3s</p>

<p>Not sure why we’re pretending he can’t do more or that he’s a complete well rounded finished product and perfect 2 way superstar</p>

      <label for="lg9hp1d" class="commentText"><p>You’re rounding down lol. He’s a 36% career shooter on some of the most difficult attempts in the league and 6 a game is decent, not high volume. He rarely takes spot up or catch and shoot threes, they’re almost always pull-ups or in transition above the break. He’s 40+ % catch and shoot guy for his career. He’s way closer to a 37-38% shooter on 7 or 8 attempts like a few years ago and he’s 39% on almost 6 attempts a game in the playoffs. Hopefully we see it this season.</p>

      <label for="lg9ifww" class="commentText"><p>Thank you that was my entire point</p>

<p>He’s a Carmelo Anthony esque tough pull up jumper player rn. Those are what earned him the Kobe comps.</p>

<p>If he added some off ball gravity, his ability to shoot (won a 3 point contest) would benefit everyone around him. If he added extra attempts per game that’d magnify that gravity even more.</p>

<p>The suns struggle with iso ball and stagnant offense also comes from their 2 best shooters not willing to sprint around the court on offense like curry/klay do so well. They’d rather take turns playing park ball pull up contested jumpers</p>

<p>Theres room for improvement. That’s all. Hope to see it this year with pgs on the roster now. Have a good one go suns</p>

      <label for="lg9izki" class="commentText"><p>His shot selection and efficiency is way better than Melo the last few years but he had a bad start to his career carrying the offensive load for bad teams. Though there’s still room for improvement. I think Vogel was an awful offensive coach and Booker was the best playmaker on the team that he was on ball a lot and didn’t have easy catch and shoot, come off screens opportunities. With the PGs and Bud that should change. That was the case in the 64-win season with Chris Paul. I hope he proves us right.</p>

      <label for="lg9lndd" class="commentText"><p>Yup definitely a more efficient player for sure, slightly different archetypes in that books more a combo guard playmaker and Melos a bigger better athlete which makes him a little better rebounder defender and post player but absolutely more of a ball stopper</p>

<p>Honestly I just want book to extend back 5 feet on his off ball curls, he practices the high elbow catch and shooter jumper so often in warmups, and he leans on it in game too.</p>

<p>Hes a star im just hoping adding a little klau Thompson off ball gravity and a extra couple 3s a game could help inferior offensive teammates get space</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a dog in this fight but it is always weird when people blame players for their defensive assignments like it&rsquo;s up to them who they are supposed to guard and who they are &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; from. Maybe Vogel wanted him to have easier defensive assignments so he could expend more energy on offense?</p>

<p>The sample size is big enough to conclude he’s only ever really been a good defender in small spurts</p>

<p>His game has remained relatively the same for years now is all I’m saying, there’s room for improvement in reasonably specific spots. That is if he wants to transcend from being a good star to a great superstar</p>

<p>He did, he slipped into a 3 &amp; D role pretty effortlessly last Olympics, just like he has in these games. He <em>did</em> have that one quarter where he went off offensively against Japan in &lsquo;21, I hope he has another game where his head is figuratively on fire for an entire quarter again this year too lol.</p>

      <label for="lg745jf" class="commentText"><p>His volume at the rim isn’t super high, but his efficiency at the rim is one of the highest of all guards in the league, especially considering he basically doesn’t dunk. He’s one of the most underrated finishers in the league.</p>

<p>‘24:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>14% of his attempts from 0-3 feet</p></li>

<li><p>Shot 76% from 0-3 feet</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Last 5 Years combined:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>16.2% of his attempts from 0-3 feet</p></li>

<li><p>Shot 71.3% from 0-3 feet</p></li>
</ul>

<p>His really high % at the rim is because he gets more “uncontested” layups that most guys, which might surprise a lotta people because he’s not super quick, explosive, or shifty. Book’s handles and driving ability are similar-ish to Luka in that they’re not super quick or flashy, just methodical and effective with great strength and use of the body as a shield.</p>

Lebron does average over a turnover more per game, obviously some of those are because Lebron attempt much riskier passes and has a higher load in playmaking, but I do feel Book turns it over slightly less on the dribble than Lebron, perhaps that&rsquo;s just in my head because I expect guards to have tighter handles than a PF.</p>

      <label for="lg72xyk" class="commentText"><p>In Steve Kerr speak, this translates to Book is his favorite player on the team. There’s nothing Steve loves more than a connector. To the point that it’s legitimately almost dangerous to give him connectors on a roster lol because he will play them above any other player on the roster if he could (and he sometimes does; eg he played Podz more than anyone else, including Steph, in games on more than one occasion last year).</p>

      <label for="lg74ug9" class="commentText"><p>Kerr and Spoelstra especially values connecting players, which I think is why the Heat was able to have such deep runs in recent years with significantly less star power than the rest of the field. But that&rsquo;s Heat culture, baby!</p>

      <label for="lg7s7fw" class="commentText"><p>This is 100% true, but I’d only add that Podz got so much playing time last year for a few reasons. Yes he fits a certain type of mold that Kerr loves, but he was also NBA ready as a rookie and w/ how Klay was playing we needed someone to step up and Podz did.</p>

      <label for="lg9v8jl" class="commentText"><p>Man Podz is so good. That Draymond choke and Klay-Jaden tussle really jumpstarted Podz&rsquo;s career lol. I remember he said that during rising stars 😂</p>

<p>Kyle Anderson despite having offensive struggles last year (his eye was fucked up, he couldn&rsquo;t even see the rim sometimes and his depth perception was messed up), is definitely a connector. One of the best glue guys around, Kerr might play him a lot. The Wolves coach could not stop playing Kyle even when his vision was affected, it was like an obsession&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lg7z5tt" class="commentText"><p>I’m going to love to see how people turn back to absolutely hating Book once the NBA starts up.</p>

<p>Honestly, I get sometimes a player just rubs people the wrong way, and I’m a homer for Devin. But I have players I hate for no good reason. It’s part of the fun of being a fan.</p>

<p>But people have been trying to discredit Book and it’s ridiculous. He’s a true baller and a winner. He does anything that will help his team win.</p>

<p>If you hate booker because of his face just say that. Don’t try to act like he’s a dirty player or a bigger whiner than 90% of superstars in the league. And certainly don’t act like he’s not a winner. It’s not his fault Arizona sports are cursed.</p>

But I&rsquo;ve never thought of him as a shutdown Defender. Is that a good assessment or am I way off base? He&rsquo;s always struck me as an offensive minded player but I&rsquo;ve never really worried about him playing the role of Jrue.</p>

<p>He does have a small featured face but if you saw my ugly mug you&rsquo;d say things about me too. I&rsquo;m still waiting for him to tell me he sees dead people</p>

      <label for="lg7y0l4" class="commentText"><p>Never understood the general disliking of Booker… he’s one of the purest most versatile ballers in the game now, and his game is super smooth and aesthetically pleasing to watch. I honestly feel like he’s on the same level of plug-and-play-ability as guys like KD, Tatum…</p>

<p>Anyway, good to see him getting his flowers. He’s excelled in so many different roles on the Suns, but a lot of people just seem to hate him.</p>

      <label for="lg82188" class="commentText"><p>He’s been top-5 in “points per touch” 3-4 times over the past 5 years, he’s a star scorer that doesn’t need to dominate the ball to score a lot.</p>

<p>He can run the PnR and make good passes and/or score out of it, he can ISO, he can run off screens off-ball, he can play off-ball without plays called for him and just CnS and attack close outs, and he’s willing to make quick passes or “extra” passes. And clearly he can be a great defender and hustle guy if his offensive load is low enough that he’s not gassed on that end (like on this USA team).</p>

<p>He would make any team in the league better, regardless of the roster, scheme, or his individual role. It’s nice to see other fans finally recognizing that, I’ve always thought his “versatility” was extremely underrated when people say stuff like “he’s one dimensional”.</p>

His scoring from all 3 levels, body control, silky smooth release, and soft touch are so fun to watch. His swishes hit different than other players. Seems like the net hardly moves.</p>

<p>Put any top 10 player on the Celtics instead of him and they’ll average 10+ assists lol.</p>

      <label for="lg7fv6n" class="commentText"><p>Even as a Suns/D Book fan, I gotta say, I feel like Tatum has the natural talent and physical gifts/attributes to be an even better “star in your role player” than D Book, for this team USA. What’s going on there?</p>

      <label for="lg7jode" class="commentText"><p>Sure but that’s not always what makes the best role player. I’m thinking team USA needs a cutting/driving 3 and D type wing. I’d give Tatum the slight nod over Book in those 3 categories (well usually 3s but apparently Tatum’s in a slump rn). Size being the differing factor that makes Tatum a better driver and defensive player. So I’m still somewhat surprised Book is excelling in that role while Tatum is barely sniffing any minutes.</p>

      <label for="lg7q26s" class="commentText"><p>Tatum is inconsistent offensively while having infinite touches on the Celtics, so it&rsquo;s pretty tough to imagine him doing better with less shots.</p>

<p>Plus there&rsquo;s no reason to play him over the other forwards on the team whereas it&rsquo;s just Book and Edwards as the main shooting guards</p>

      <label for="lg7i6ja" class="commentText"><p>Hmm, interesting. I’d think that with Jrue, Derrick and Brown on the C’s, Tatum would be more used to not having the ball in his hands as much. He’s definitely a much more capable defender given his size and length, not sure if willing, maybe just some burn out from the title run?</p>

      <label for="lg7pfgy" class="commentText"><p>He’s good without the ball in his hands because he covers a lot in matchup versatility, especially on defense. For example against Dallas, he’s basically the reason why the single best lob threat offense in the league couldn’t get it going. On a stacked team like this you have basically the perfect player available for any given matchup at a time so a guy like that isn’t as useful as he would be on a less talented team. For example, Tatum matching up with a center is great for a switchable defensive scheme in general, but why would you do that when you have the two best defensive centers available who can also hang on offense/switch down to the wing</p>

      <label for="lg80f8a" class="commentText"><p>This is actually a great description of why Tatum is so valuable and impactful on an NBA roster but not as much on this USA team.</p>

<p>On basically any NBA team, Tatum would be a top 3 on the team scorer, shooter, playmaker, perimeter defender, interior defender, and rebounder all at the same time. Hence why he’s so valuable and great despite no “elite” skills other than scoring (people love to hate but he’s no doubt an elite scorer). When he’s on the court he’s legitimately one of the team’s best options for anything you ask of him.</p>

<p>On this USA team, he’s not a “top 3 on the team” at anything. There’s better self-creators, better shooters, better playmakers, better PoA defenders, better Rim Protectors, and better rebounders. He’s still arguably the most well rounded out of all of them, but that’s not needed on a team like this. They want the best option for each specific role on the court, which isn’t Tatum for any given ROLE.</p>

      <label for="lg7wr6g" class="commentText"><p>Yeah exactly, imo he&rsquo;s basically a coaches&rsquo; &ldquo;safety blanket&rdquo; because he is good and versatile so can play with a variety of players/lineups, but you don&rsquo;t need a safety blanket on team USA lol.</p>

      <label for="lg7p3wk" class="commentText"><p>He’s slumping hard with his shooting and Team USA hasn’t need the extra size/physicality from the wing position on defense. Maybe against a team like Germany, if Franz gets cooking it’ll be nice to have Tatum on the court but the team needs Books shooting right now</p>
