</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Michael Jordan in 1989-1990 regular season, the first under Phil Jackson who was promoted from head coach, played all 82 games. The Bulls finish with a 55-27 record, 3rd in the Eastern Conference.</p>

<p>MJ for the season averaged 33.6 ppg 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg. He averaged 2.8(!) steals per game and 0.7 blocks per game, 3 turnovers per game. He averaged 54.8% on his 2s, 37.6% on his 3s and and 84.8% on his FTs. His TS% was 60.6% and VORP was 10.6 (BPM 11.2).</p>

<p>In the playoffs the Bulls would go all the way to the Conference Finals, where they would matchup with the Bad Boys again. Pippen would have a migraine before game 7 and the Bulls lose in 7.</p>

<p>In the 16 playoff games MJ played, he averages 36.7 ppg 7.2 rpg 6.8 apg 2.8 spg and 0.9 bpg. He averages 54.0% on his 2p attempts, 32% on his 3s, and 83.6 on his FTs, for 59.2% TS on the playoffs. He had a BPM of 13.7! in the playoffs.</p>

<p>First round against Bucks (3-1): 36.8 ppg 8 rpg 7 apg 2.5 spg 1 bpg</p>

<p>Second Round Against 76ers (4-1): 43 ppg 6.6 rpg 7.4 apg 4.0(!!) spg and 1.2 bpg</p>

<p>And Conference Finals Loss Against The Bad Boys (3-4): 32.1 ppg 7.1 rpg 6.3 apg 2.1 spg 0.6 rpg</p>

<p>VORP: Value Over Replacement</p>

<p>TS: True Shooting</p>

<p>BPM/ Box Plus/Minus</p>

<p>MJ finished 3rd place in MVP voting this year, behind Charles Barkley and the winner Magic Johnson.</p>

<p>Is 88-89 season is more efficient but he had more volume this season because he ended up shooting more than 2 3 pointers per game compared to the 88-89 season, which he drained at an efficient rate. He’s had other  regular seasons with higher VORP, being 87-88, 88-89, and 90-91.</p>

<p>So it’s clear that this 89-90 season is in the middle of the prime, but I think since Pippen hadn’t fully became great and was the reason they lost in game 7, I would say this could very well be his best season. It’s his highest scoring playoffs in the years he got passed the first round as well.</p>

<p>What do y’all think?</p>

      <label for="ll8oq3s" class="commentText"><p>It actually is. Along with the 1991 season.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched his playoff run, he was dropping 40+ points and playing amazing defense like nothing. idk if that&rsquo;s ever been done before in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And this is an example someone ACTUALLY getting robbed of MVP.</p>

<p>As in having the clear best season in the league while on a high seeded team and still not getting it.</p>

<p>Not getting outshined by other players but still &ldquo;deserving MVP&rdquo; because you had the highest status of anyone.</p>

<p>But his 87-88 has a strong case.  MVP and DPOY in the same year is nasty work.  <sup>35</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.9 on 53% with 3.2 steals and a pretty great 1.6 blocks for a guard</p>

<p>Got stonewalled by the Pistons in the second round but still averaged 36 ppg in the playoffs on the back of an absolutely absurd 45 ppg in 5 games vs the Cavs</p>

<p>Impact metrics weren’t around then but I’m willing to say that despite his ridiculous counting stats early in his career, his net impact metrics would have been better in the mid 60s with Philly if they had existed. </p>

      <label for="ll9hek3" class="commentText"><p>Yea I agree with you. Not really trying to criticize Wilt but it’s interesting to evaluate like peak success relative to team play. Always hard. I actually don’t know this particular answer tbh. I’m just guessing mid 60s Wilt was better impact wise but it might have been early 60s Wilt and I’m wrong.</p>

<p>I’m only guessing with no actual evidence (which really isn’t possible) because one huge change he made in the middle of his career was he started taking fewer shots, increased his efficiency, and for the missed shots he used to take, he passed it more to his teammates for better looks. Also allowed him to focus more energy on defense.  </p>

<p>I still can be completely wrong though and maybe his peak impact was also just early in his career when he had his peak stats. His teammates were certainly better later in his career so that also had an effect. </p>

      <label for="lla16gk" class="commentText"><p>That’s a completely different era though. Wilt had the second highest fg% in the league that year while in Jordan’s year he had the 63rd highest (45th best TS%). So while Jordan took a shit ton of possessions and scored a bunch, he was still doing it at a rate of 45th best option in the league. Everyone knew that wilt was getting the ball and was the 2nd best option in the league with the whole defence guarding him. </p>

<p>TS% is hardly comparable between a guy who only scores around 3 feet and a guy who actually shoots the ball! </p>

<p>Wilt had a medicore 50.6 fg%, 53.6 TS%, +5.7 rTS%</p>

<p>In &lsquo;88 Jordan averaged 43.6 per 100 on 53.5 fg%, 61.4 TS%, +7.7 rTS%! </p>

<p>The SG Jordan scored at a better clip in higher total and relative effiency than 7&rsquo;2 Wilt! </p>

<p>On totals Wilts season will never be matched. With context MJ cleared him easily on volume and effiency.</p>

      <label for="ll9162n" class="commentText"><p>Bird&rsquo;s 86 campaign is worth your consideration:</p>

<p>Regular season: 25.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.8  with 2.0 steals and 0.6 blocks. He played 82 games, 38 minutes per game.</p>

<p>Wins MVP, Finals MVP and the Championship.</p>

<p>Celtics set the all time home record (40-1).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Magic has a season where he dominates and brings everything home. But I&rsquo;ll let the Lakers fans decide which season best represents that.</p>

      <label for="ll9j7dc" class="commentText"><p>Luka is a ball-dominant helio, very unlike Bird, who often operated off-ball and within the system. People see the assist numbers and the highlights and assume he was a point forward like LeBron or something but that’s not actually how he generally played.</p>

<p>Luka’s also one of the players who is a great scorer but not really a particularly noteworthy pure shooter. Very different from Bird, who is one of the greatest pure shooters ever.</p>

<p>Defensively Bird was good, Luka is not. That part’s cut and dry.</p>

<p>Touch? You already said Jokic, and Jokic’s touch is better than Luka’s (Jokic probably has the best touch in the league, not a knock on Luka). So what does the Luka component of your hybrid comparison actually add?</p>

<p>Yeah, just doesn’t make sense in the slightest.</p>

      <label for="ll9i3wo" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve said this before but I think 89-90, 90-91 and 91-92 was Jordan&rsquo;s peak.</p>

<p>89-90 most athleticism but the rest of his game from an IQ and feel standpoint has rounded out better when compared 87-89.</p>

<p>90-91 still ridiculous athleticism. Smarter, plays with a little more pace and picks his spots in the offense better.</p>

<p>91-92 Apex of athleticism still near it&rsquo;s peak but probably the deadliest he ever was as a shooter and overall scoring threat without having to exert as much energy to score at the rim. His motor was still pretty ridiculous but you can see that this is where he really started to pick his spots more on both ends of the floor. Him becoming a knockdown shooter also spread his gravity farther from the rim and opened up things for his teammates more.</p>

<p>93 is where his athleticism started to decline a bit but he was still a beast attacking the basket and had a shooting touch on par with 91-92. He also picked up on a few more reads and post moves at this point. Or, at least, started using them more because he couldn&rsquo;t quite jump like a madman every time he got to the paint.</p>

<p>I could go either way if someone wants to argue 89-90 or 92-93 Jordan, though. But do I think 90-91 and 91-92 are when he was at his deadliest when you consider how much more being an outside shooting threat caused him to warp and manipulate defenses when they tried to prevent him from attacking the basket.</p>

<p>The thing with Jordan, though, is that he kept getting smarter as a player even as his athleticism started to decline in the later 3-peat.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s hard exactly to say where Jordan being more creative with his approach to the game ends and his athletic decline begins. He also had an extremely gentle decline compared to just about anyone to ever play the sport.</p>

<p>Even by the later 90s he was still more quick and agile than just about anyone that could guard him even if his peak athletic days were behind him.</p>

<p>Even when he couldn&rsquo;t just throw himself at the basket every other play and jump over/around everyone, he started using all of his pivot and shot-fake counters more and unlocked a whole new paranoia that defenses had to account for.</p>

<p>As insane as 80s Jordan was in terms of athleticism and pure endless motor, I really think that he became deadlier as a player once he got better from an IQ and feel/shooting standpoint in 90,91 and 92.</p>

<p>93 is an honorable mention if not just for the fact that he set a scoring average record in the finals and outplayed the regular season MVP in Barkley.</p>

<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve mentioned before but 96-97 Jordan also gets overlooked, especially that whole playoff run.</p>

<p>I really think that was Jordan&rsquo;s peak from a mental/IQ standpoint but he wasn&rsquo;t as drained like he was in 98 by the time the playoffs came around. As a result he still played near his peak when he needed to.</p>

<p>He lead the Bulls to a season where they almost repeated a 70-win season (with some crazy win streaks) until a handful of players started experiencing injuries right before the playoffs, and then he pulled a pretty underrated playoff run in spite of team&rsquo;s said injury issues.</p>

<p>Pippen was hurt in the first round of the playoffs and playing injured, and then got injured again against Miami in the ECF. Rodman was injured at the end of the season and continued to have issues in the playoffs, wearing a knee-brace for a good chunk of the playoffs. Other rotation players were experiencing injuries as well.</p>

<p>This is probably the most distilled version of playoff Jordan having as little help from a team standpoint and still winning a championship.</p>

<p>98 game 6 is probably the best distillation of Jordan carrying if we&rsquo;re talking about a single game, but the 97 finals was when he really turned beyond mythical. He came up big in the finals and it was a revenge series where MJ hits a game winner in the first game.</p>

<p>You can throw any stats you want out there for peak Jordan seasons but 97 Jordan is the best MJ season from a narrative standpoint IMO. Every playoff series is a good experience that illustrates how much he brought that team to another level and put up ridiculous performances in the process.</p>

      <label for="ll9lo2w" class="commentText"><p>Greatest overview of his entire prime basically. But 87-89 were the wild pre triangle years where where was likely the greater slasher and driver the game has ever seen. 1990 first year of the triangle and the team is one way away from the finals. He plays more off ball and comes of off various off ball actions in the triangle. Systems gets more refined by 91 and he also averages 11 assists in the finals and 8 in the playoffs. 1992 is interesting because the Bulls team improves in every facet and they win 67 games too. MJ averages 34/6/6 in the playoffs and 30/6/6 in the regular season and wins MVP. Arguably best season in terms of individual scoring and winning and efficiency.</p>

<p>98 was honestly a classic MJ carry job since Rodman was negative offensively and Pippen had back problems. Kukoc was the only other reliable guy on offense during many games, so MJ really had to carry and averages 28 ppg.</p>

      <label for="ll9vzuo" class="commentText"><p>He came around lots of off-ball screens pre-triangle. And Jordan was pretty much taking consistent mid-range jumpers off of them and off the dribble by 87.</p>

<p>He developed a more consistent long mid-range jumper and brought together his post game from that point on.</p>

<p>87-88 and 88-89 is just a relentless machine with regards to his motor, though. It&rsquo;s like a basketball Terminator with its first priority set to just get a dunk or layup on every play.</p>

<p>On one hand, you can see moments where he didn&rsquo;t quite have the same IQ/mapping and feel that he would get by the 90s.</p>

<p>On the other hand, 87-89 Jordan was just a torrent of chaos on defense and probably the best &ldquo;rim protection&rdquo; version of himself, since he was able to contest just about everything and get around the court so damn quickly with a near endless well of energy.</p>

<p>His blocks and steals from that era make plenty of highlight reels. But Jordan was such a nuisance on defense near the basket and disrupted so many shots just because he could try and reach his apex jump on contests or fly on from behind players so quickly. He also had so much more energy back then to try and contest as many shots as possible.</p>

<p>84-88, 89-93 and 96-98 is an interesting evolution for MJ when you think about it. He pretty much enters the league as an MVP-level/All-NBA-level player with once in a generation level athleticism and an unparalleled layup package, and then he becomes one of the best mid-range shooters in NBA history with an insane post-up and back-to-basket game.</p>

<p>89-93 is when all of those attributes/skills lined the most with each other. He could score pretty much any way he wanted at will while being an absolutely suffocating defender.</p>

<p>Nobody could stop him once his game was fully rounded and he had a decent team to take some attention/defensive pressure off of him.</p>

<p>96-98 was where Jordan turned into the GOAT for a lot of doubters, though. And it really felt like it he was out for revenge on the whole NBA in the 97 playoffs after Malone got the MVP. Even moreso than 93 with Barkley.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as though Jordan was like, &ldquo;No, dropping a 40pt average and winning 70 games isn&rsquo;t good enough. I need to make them feel like they have a chance at all times and then I want to rip their hearts out over and over again so that everyone will remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the moment it really felt like Jordan was on god-like levels compared to everyone else that had ever played in the NBA. Stats and accolades don&rsquo;t really do justice when it comes to conveying the sheer terror Jordan created when momentum started to shift in a game. He was like the absolute embodiment of the &ldquo;No! NOO! NOT THIS GUY!&rdquo; moment.</p>

<p>And then the 98 finals just ramped the whole idea up to 11 with that chef&rsquo;s kiss sequence of events during the last minute of game 6.</p>

      <label for="ll97y4u" class="commentText"><p>If we’re just talking regular season and we’re not necessarily talking about how successful the team was, I have a hard time saying that any season MJ had in the late ‘80’s was clearly the best of all time, especially considering that you picked a year where he doesn’t win the MVP.</p>

<p>You can make the argument that, in 2009, Lebron was carrying a bigger offensive load and elevating his team more despite clear roster deficiencies, and that he was similarly effective on defense. 2016 Curry also comes to mind, just off pure offensive power. Curry in February that year averaged 40 points shooting 50% from 3. That’s disgusting. There’s a plurality of MVPs with absurd stat lines and achievements.</p>

<p>I will say, I don’t think there should be any disagreement that MJ is the clear cut greatest two way guard ever. Even if you don’t think his DPOY is valid, he was clearly a lethal perimeter threat that dissuaded offenses from passing too much. Speaking of which, for a shooting guard, he was pretty great at making plays for his teammates, in conjunction with being the greatest scorer ever. Late 80’s/early 90’s MJ is arguably the greatest multi-year peak of any player ever, and it’s self-evident as for why.</p>

<p>He’s not my GOAT but he’s a lot of people’s GOAT for a damn good reason.</p>

<p>And def not irrelevant seasons, I agree. Great for showcasing individual skill.</p>

<p>I remember the media talking about how Mj was so good but doubted his playstyle could win rings.</p>

He also excels in making his teammates better with his exceptional passing and court vision.

That&rsquo;s a narrative that couldnt be farther from the truth.</p>

<p>Lets have a look at his side kicks: 3 years Sample size:</p>

<p>Wade:</p>

<p>Before Lebron: 27.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.1</p>

<p>With LeBron: 22.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.9</p>

<p>Bosh:</p>

<p>Before Lebron: <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.0</p>

<p>With Lebron: 17.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.0</p>

<p>AD:</p>

<p>Before Lebron: 27.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.4</p>

<p>With Lebron: 24.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.4</p>

<p>Love:</p>

<p>Before Lebron: 25.1/13/3.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.5</p>

<p>With Lebron: 17.1/10/2.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.5</p>

<p>Kyrie: * we  have to take the after with him cause of age (26- 28):</p>

<p>After Lebron: 25.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.6</p>

<p>With Lebron: 23.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.3</p>

      <label for="ll907bw" class="commentText"><p>As a shooter sure, but that&rsquo;s about it. IMO he was a more accurate passer back then, certainly more dangerous going to the rim, and defensively you&rsquo;re comparing an elite defender to a bad one.</p>

<p>It looks closer than it is because of how much the game changed to make life easier for ball dominant perimeter players. 2009 LeBron in 2018 spacing is a different player, and he already had an elite 3pt cast for the era.</p>

      <label for="ll8w1nh" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I know it probably sounds like sour grapes coming from a Raptors fan, but I don’t think 2018 Lebron is even a top 3 season for him.</p>

<p>From a statistical standpoint, it’s hard to argue against 2009. Especially in the playoffs - even though they didn’t make it to the finals.</p>

<p>My eye and gut tell me that 2013 was Lebron’s absolute peak. His defence, athleticism, shooting, all came together. And I think he was more aggressive when he needed to be than later on.</p>

<p>Still, it’s hard to argue against 2016. His IQ and feel for the game became his best quality. That finals was way, way more impressive to me than his 2018 finals. Those numbers are slightly inflated because of how weak the starting lineup was in 2018.</p>

<p>Obviously 2018 Lebron was still legendary. But I’d take 2009, 2013, 2016, and probably 2012 Lebron over 2018. Maybe even 2020, but that’s probably a stretch.</p>

<p>2018 just puts a magnifying glass on how good second-stint cavaliers LeBron truly was, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that he was better in 2018.</p>

      <label for="ll8wfnc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it shouldn’t be used as a knock on Lebron because you have to play the teams in front of you. But I think people tend to forget how bad the east was during the second Cleveland stint.</p>

<p>2018 he beat a sorry Pacers team, a frightened raptors team (who imo had regressed from 2016), and a baby Boston squad. Hard to think of one legit, elite, contending team in the east outside of the Cavs in that period.</p>

<p>EDIT: The pacers were a legit good team imo but I think they were only relevant during the Miami years, no? So was Boston from 2008-2012 obviously.</p>

<p>But from 2015-2018 the best team they faced was probably Atlanta? Maybe the 2016 Raptors but even as a fan I don’t think so.</p>
