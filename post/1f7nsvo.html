</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Michael Jordan in 1989-1990 regular season, the first under Phil Jackson who was promoted from head coach, played all 82 games. The Bulls finish with a 55-27 record, 3rd in the Eastern Conference.</p>

<p>MJ for the season averaged 33.6 ppg 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg. He averaged 2.8(!) steals per game and 0.7 blocks per game, 3 turnovers per game. He averaged 54.8% on his 2s, 37.6% on his 3s and and 84.8% on his FTs. His TS% was 60.6% and VORP was 10.6 (BPM 11.2).</p>

<p>In the playoffs the Bulls would go all the way to the Conference Finals, where they would matchup with the Bad Boys again. Pippen would have a migraine before game 7 and the Bulls lose in 7.</p>

<p>In the 16 playoff games MJ played, he averages 36.7 ppg 7.2 rpg 6.8 apg 2.8 spg and 0.9 bpg. He averages 54.0% on his 2p attempts, 32% on his 3s, and 83.6 on his FTs, for 59.2% TS on the playoffs. He had a BPM of 13.7! in the playoffs.</p>

<p>First round against Bucks (3-1): 36.8 ppg 8 rpg 7 apg 2.5 spg 1 bpg</p>

<p>Second Round Against 76ers (4-1): 43 ppg 6.6 rpg 7.4 apg 4.0(!!) spg and 1.2 bpg</p>

<p>And Conference Finals Loss Against The Bad Boys (3-4): 32.1 ppg 7.1 rpg 6.3 apg 2.1 spg 0.6 rpg</p>

<p>VORP: Value Over Replacement</p>

<p>TS: True Shooting</p>

<p>BPM/ Box Plus/Minus</p>

<p>MJ finished 3rd place in MVP voting this year, behind Charles Barkley and the winner Magic Johnson.</p>

<p>Is 88-89 season is more efficient but he had more volume this season because he ended up shooting more than 2 3 pointers per game compared to the 88-89 season, which he drained at an efficient rate. He’s had other  regular seasons with higher VORP, being 87-88, 88-89, and 90-91.</p>

<p>So it’s clear that this 89-90 season is in the middle of the prime, but I think since Pippen hadn’t fully became great and was the reason they lost in game 7, I would say this could very well be his best season. It’s his highest scoring playoffs in the years he got passed the first round as well.</p>

<p>What do y’all think?</p>

      <label for="ll8oq3s" class="commentText"><p>It actually is. Along with the 1991 season.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched his playoff run, he was dropping 40 PPG and playing amazing defense. id if that&rsquo;s ever been done before in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And this is an example someone ACTUALLY getting robbed of MVP. As in having the clear best season in the league while on a high seeded team and still not getting it.</p>

<p>Not getting outshined by other players but still &ldquo;deserving MVP&rdquo; because you had the highest status of anyone.</p>
