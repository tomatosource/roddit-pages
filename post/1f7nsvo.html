</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Michael Jordan in 1989-1990 regular season, the first under Phil Jackson who was promoted from head coach, played all 82 games. The Bulls finish with a 55-27 record, 3rd in the Eastern Conference.</p>

<p>MJ for the season averaged 33.6 ppg 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg. He averaged 2.8(!) steals per game and 0.7 blocks per game, 3 turnovers per game. He averaged 54.8% on his 2s, 37.6% on his 3s and and 84.8% on his FTs. His TS% was 60.6% and VORP was 10.6 (BPM 11.2).</p>

<p>In the playoffs the Bulls would go all the way to the Conference Finals, where they would matchup with the Bad Boys again. Pippen would have a migraine before game 7 and the Bulls lose in 7.</p>

<p>In the 16 playoff games MJ played, he averages 36.7 ppg 7.2 rpg 6.8 apg 2.8 spg and 0.9 bpg. He averages 54.0% on his 2p attempts, 32% on his 3s, and 83.6 on his FTs, for 59.2% TS on the playoffs. He had a BPM of 13.7! in the playoffs.</p>

<p>First round against Bucks (3-1): 36.8 ppg 8 rpg 7 apg 2.5 spg 1 bpg</p>

<p>Second Round Against 76ers (4-1): 43 ppg 6.6 rpg 7.4 apg 4.0(!!) spg and 1.2 bpg</p>

<p>And Conference Finals Loss Against The Bad Boys (3-4): 32.1 ppg 7.1 rpg 6.3 apg 2.1 spg 0.6 rpg</p>

<p>VORP: Value Over Replacement</p>

<p>TS: True Shooting</p>

<p>BPM/ Box Plus/Minus</p>

<p>MJ finished 3rd place in MVP voting this year, behind Charles Barkley and the winner Magic Johnson.</p>

<p>Is 88-89 season is more efficient but he had more volume this season because he ended up shooting more than 2 3 pointers per game compared to the 88-89 season, which he drained at an efficient rate. He’s had other  regular seasons with higher VORP, being 87-88, 88-89, and 90-91.</p>

<p>So it’s clear that this 89-90 season is in the middle of the prime, but I think since Pippen hadn’t fully became great and was the reason they lost in game 7, I would say this could very well be his best season. It’s his highest scoring playoffs in the years he got passed the first round as well.</p>

<p>What do y’all think?</p>

<p>1991 Jordan had all the athleticism, finishing, and defense of rookie Jordan, but was unstoppable from the midrange pullup, and could playmake at an elite level</p>

      <label for="ll8oq3s" class="commentText"><p>It actually is. Along with the 1991 season.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched his playoff run, he was dropping 40+ points and playing amazing defense like nothing. idk if that&rsquo;s ever been done before in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And this is an example someone ACTUALLY getting robbed of MVP.</p>

<p>As in having the clear best season in the league while on a high seeded team and still not getting it.</p>

<p>Not getting outshined by other players but still &ldquo;deserving MVP&rdquo; because you had the highest status of anyone.</p>

      <label for="ll90j4g" class="commentText"><p>I think MJ reached his actual game effectiveness peak with higher IQ and a little better jumpshot coming into play in those early 90s</p>

<p>But his 87-88 has a strong case.  MVP and DPOY in the same year is nasty work.  <sup>35</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.9 on 53% with 3.2 steals and a pretty great 1.6 blocks for a guard</p>

<p>Got stonewalled by the Pistons in the second round but still averaged 36 ppg in the playoffs on the back of an absolutely absurd 45 ppg in 5 games vs the Cavs</p>

      <label for="llamgxt" class="commentText"><p>Said Youtuber, Jonny Arnett , didnt even know the actual rules. Same as that Haberstroh Clown. Poorly researched hit piece with several Rookie mistakes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the source: 5 private VHS tapes from latvia. Latvia was part of the soviet union in &lsquo;88. How many Bulls Games were on national russian TV in &lsquo;88?</p></li>

<li><p>the Scorekeeper: the Grizzlies Scorekeeper was asked about this.
Problem: the Grizzlies had their first season in &lsquo;96. We are talking &lsquo;88 here. The Grizzlies Scorekeeper didnt even have a Job in &lsquo;88.</p></li>

<li><p>They used todays standards in their countings. Not the standards of &lsquo;88. 
They treated deflections as an indipendent official stat, which it is not! In &lsquo;88 deflections werent even tracked!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The rule description is rather vague.
Per rule: you can get credited a steal when:</p>

<p>You deflect, teammates gains possession. </p>

<p>Teammate deflects, you gain possession.</p>

<p>You deflect, you gain possession.</p>

<p>Arnett and Haberstroh only counted steals as steals were MJ deflected. That is not correct by the rules. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>On top: there was no replays in &lsquo;88. Decisions were made in real time. </p></li>

<li><p>Arnett also showed that MJ had way more Blocks than officially recorded. Half of them wete recorded as steals, cause the NBA only recorded clear swats as Blocks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If we ad all this up. MJs Stocks actually were pretty accurate! Where they counted in MJs favor? Yes.
Where those countings correct according to the rules? Yes.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Outside those 5 Cherry picked Games his steals and Blocks were accurate in every other Game! </p></li>

<li><p>What also didnt got mentioned: away Scorekeeper deflated numbers as well! </p></li>
</ul>

      </div>
      <label for="llbpd66" class="commentText"><p>No. According to the rules its up to Interpretation of the Scorekeeper who gets the credit for an steal.</p>

<p>In most cases the one who deflected also gains possession.</p>

<p>In the case where Player a deflected and teammate b gained possession its the Scorekeeper who decided who got the steal. Especially back then without replay.</p>

<p>Often times Jordan was credited if he either deflected or gained possession. That&rsquo;s certainly favorable treatment, but correct by the rules. Especially in a time without replay where decisions were made in real time. </p>

<p>Haberstroh accused Jordan recieved steals who werent correct by the rules. That simply is not true. His Argumentation is based on the (wrong) conclusion that only the one who deflected can get an steal. He treated deflections as an Independent sub stat. Deflections werent tracked or counted in &lsquo;88. </p>

      <label for="llbq7uq" class="commentText"><p>I am glad they changed it in that case. I think there is merit to the idea that we should normalize the stats to a certain standard when we can.</p>

<p>When you hear “Jordan averaged 2.8 steals per game” and think about modern steals leaders (usually around 2.0), it sounds more impressive than if you know that steals were counted differently back then.</p>

<p>Just another era adjustment to keep in mind if you want to compare players.</p>

      <label for="llbu2i2" class="commentText"><p>Contrary to popular believe, the 80s wete fast pace with a lot more possessions. </p>

<p>In Jordans case that whole topic is overblown. 90% of the time Jordan deflected and gained possession himself.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Haberstroh Hand picked these 5 Games as they had &ldquo;questionlable&rdquo; steals by todays standards. </p>

<p>Btw todays Assists are given way more lose as ever. The rule is also vague. </p>

<p>25% of todays Assists would not have been counted in the &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s! </p>

<p>Every stat besides scoring is always subject to Interpretation. </p>

<p>We could do the same for Lebrons assists and cut 25% off right away. There are enough vids doing exactly that. </p>

<p>But at the end of the day Jordan averaged 2.3 steals and Lebron averages 7.4 Assists.</p>

<p>You can nit pick for anybody! </p>

      <label for="ll9i3wo" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve said this before but I think 89-90, 90-91 and 91-92 was Jordan&rsquo;s peak.</p>

<p>89-90 most athleticism but the rest of his game from an IQ and feel standpoint has rounded out better when compared 87-89.</p>

<p>90-91 still ridiculous athleticism. Smarter, plays with a little more pace and picks his spots in the offense better.</p>

<p>91-92 Apex of athleticism still near it&rsquo;s peak but probably the deadliest he ever was as a shooter and overall scoring threat without having to exert as much energy to score at the rim. His motor was still pretty ridiculous but you can see that this is where he really started to pick his spots more on both ends of the floor. Him becoming a knockdown shooter also spread his gravity farther from the rim and opened up things for his teammates more.</p>

<p>93 is where his athleticism started to decline a bit but he was still a beast attacking the basket and had a shooting touch on par with 91-92. He also picked up on a few more reads and post moves at this point. Or, at least, started using them more because he couldn&rsquo;t quite jump like a madman every time he got to the paint.</p>

<p>I could go either way if someone wants to argue 89-90 or 92-93 Jordan, though. But do I think 90-91 and 91-92 are when he was at his deadliest when you consider how much more being an outside shooting threat caused him to warp and manipulate defenses when they tried to prevent him from attacking the basket.</p>

<p>The thing with Jordan, though, is that he kept getting smarter as a player even as his athleticism started to decline in the later 3-peat.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s hard exactly to say where Jordan being more creative with his approach to the game ends and his athletic decline begins. He also had an extremely gentle decline compared to just about anyone to ever play the sport.</p>

<p>Even by the later 90s he was still more quick and agile than just about anyone that could guard him even if his peak athletic days were behind him.</p>

<p>Even when he couldn&rsquo;t just throw himself at the basket every other play and jump over/around everyone, he started using all of his pivot and shot-fake counters more and unlocked a whole new paranoia that defenses had to account for.</p>

<p>As insane as 80s Jordan was in terms of athleticism and pure endless motor, I really think that he became deadlier as a player once he got better from an IQ and feel/shooting standpoint in 90,91 and 92.</p>

<p>93 is an honorable mention if not just for the fact that he set a scoring average record in the finals and outplayed the regular season MVP in Barkley.</p>

<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve mentioned before but 96-97 Jordan also gets overlooked, especially that whole playoff run.</p>

<p>I really think that was Jordan&rsquo;s peak from a mental/IQ standpoint but he wasn&rsquo;t as drained like he was in 98 by the time the playoffs came around. As a result he still played near his peak when he needed to.</p>

<p>He lead the Bulls to a season where they almost repeated a 70-win season (with some crazy win streaks) until a handful of players started experiencing injuries right before the playoffs, and then he pulled a pretty underrated playoff run in spite of team&rsquo;s said injury issues.</p>

<p>Pippen was hurt in the first round of the playoffs and playing injured, and then got injured again against Miami in the ECF. Rodman was injured at the end of the season and continued to have issues in the playoffs, wearing a knee-brace for a good chunk of the playoffs. Other rotation players were experiencing injuries as well.</p>

<p>This is probably the most distilled version of playoff Jordan having as little help from a team standpoint and still winning a championship.</p>

<p>98 game 6 is probably the best distillation of Jordan carrying if we&rsquo;re talking about a single game, but the 97 finals was when he really turned beyond mythical. He came up big in the finals and it was a revenge series where MJ hits a game winner in the first game.</p>

<p>You can throw any stats you want out there for peak Jordan seasons but 97 Jordan is the best MJ season from a narrative standpoint IMO. Every playoff series is a good experience that illustrates how much he brought that team to another level and put up ridiculous performances in the process.</p>

      <label for="ll9lo2w" class="commentText"><p>Greatest overview of his entire prime basically. But 87-89 were the wild pre triangle years where where was likely the greater slasher and driver the game has ever seen. 1990 first year of the triangle and the team is one way away from the finals. He plays more off ball and comes of off various off ball actions in the triangle. Systems gets more refined by 91 and he also averages 11 assists in the finals and 8 in the playoffs. 1992 is interesting because the Bulls team improves in every facet and they win 67 games too. MJ averages 34/6/6 in the playoffs and 30/6/6 in the regular season and wins MVP. Arguably best season in terms of individual scoring and winning and efficiency.</p>

<p>98 was honestly a classic MJ carry job since Rodman was negative offensively and Pippen had back problems. Kukoc was the only other reliable guy on offense during many games, so MJ really had to carry and averages 28 ppg.</p>

      <label for="ll9vzuo" class="commentText"><p>He came around lots of off-ball screens pre-triangle. And Jordan was pretty much taking consistent mid-range jumpers off of them and off the dribble by 87.</p>

<p>He developed a more consistent long mid-range jumper and brought together his post game from that point on.</p>

<p>87-88 and 88-89 is just a relentless machine with regards to his motor, though. It&rsquo;s like a basketball Terminator with its first priority set to just get a dunk or layup on every play.</p>

<p>On one hand, you can see moments where he didn&rsquo;t quite have the same IQ/mapping and feel that he would get by the 90s.</p>

<p>On the other hand, 87-89 Jordan was just a torrent of chaos on defense and probably the best &ldquo;rim protection&rdquo; version of himself, since he was able to contest just about everything and get around the court so damn quickly with a near endless well of energy.</p>

<p>His blocks and steals from that era make plenty of highlight reels. But Jordan was such a nuisance on defense near the basket and disrupted so many shots just because he could try and reach his apex jump on contests or fly on from behind players so quickly. He also had so much more energy back then to try and contest as many shots as possible.</p>

<p>84-88, 89-93 and 96-98 is an interesting evolution for MJ when you think about it. He pretty much enters the league as an MVP-level/All-NBA-level player with once in a generation level athleticism and an unparalleled layup package, and then he becomes one of the best mid-range shooters in NBA history with an insane post-up and back-to-basket game.</p>

<p>89-93 is when all of those attributes/skills lined the most with each other. He could score pretty much any way he wanted at will while being an absolutely suffocating defender.</p>

<p>Nobody could stop him once his game was fully rounded and he had a decent team to take some attention/defensive pressure off of him.</p>

<p>96-98 was where Jordan turned into the GOAT for a lot of doubters, though. And it really felt like it he was out for revenge on the whole NBA in the 97 playoffs after Malone got the MVP. Even moreso than 93 with Barkley.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as though Jordan was like, &ldquo;No, dropping a 40pt average and winning 70 games isn&rsquo;t good enough. I need to make them feel like they have a chance at all times and then I want to rip their hearts out over and over again so that everyone will remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the moment it really felt like Jordan was on god-like levels compared to everyone else that had ever played in the NBA. Stats and accolades don&rsquo;t really do justice when it comes to conveying the sheer terror Jordan created when momentum started to shift in a game. He was like the absolute embodiment of the &ldquo;No! NOO! NOT THIS GUY!&rdquo; moment.</p>

<p>And then the 98 finals just ramped the whole idea up to 11 with that chef&rsquo;s kiss sequence of events during the last minute of game 6.</p>

      <label for="ll9hek3" class="commentText"><p>Yea I agree with you. Not really trying to criticize Wilt but it’s interesting to evaluate like peak success relative to team play. Always hard. I actually don’t know this particular answer tbh. I’m just guessing mid 60s Wilt was better impact wise but it might have been early 60s Wilt and I’m wrong.</p>

<p>I’m only guessing with no actual evidence (which really isn’t possible) because one huge change he made in the middle of his career was he started taking fewer shots, increased his efficiency, and for the missed shots he used to take, he passed it more to his teammates for better looks. Also allowed him to focus more energy on defense.  </p>

<p>I still can be completely wrong though and maybe his peak impact was also just early in his career when he had his peak stats. His teammates were certainly better later in his career so that also had an effect. </p>

Especially if you consider pre 3 pt line and an era with underdeveloped technique for basketball. It&rsquo;s totally reasonable to think that wilt efficiency compared to his era was way more impressive than Jordan&rsquo;s efficiency in his own era, as MJ +rTS isn&rsquo;t even close to the best rTS of his own era.</p>

<p>Also Wilt scored most of his points of layups and jumpshots weirdfully. He didn&rsquo;t even dunk that much.</p>

      <label for="llagg3c" class="commentText"><p>How is a 50.6 fg% “mediocre” when it’s the second best in the league????? And you are using rTS% when TS+ is much more applicable here because the league average TS% changed by a huge margin. For TS+ (which is year adjusted which you should ALWAYS use when comparing different eras TS%) they both had 112. If you want to compare their best years you could also do that. Jordan’s best years were 114 and 113 TS+ while Wilt’s were 138 and 129.</p>

<p>You could also compare their careers where Wilt’s career average was 113 for TS+ vs Jordan’s average of 106 for his career (108 when in Chicago). </p>

<p>Saying that Jordan cleared wilt on volume and efficiency is so incorrect it isn’t even funny. You have to compare era to era when dealing with efficiency which you are not doing correctly. </p>

<p>Jordan TS% was 61.4, league average was 53.7%= +7.7 rTS%</p>

<p>Jordan had the better fg%, better TS%, better rTS%, better per 100 average! That&rsquo;s not debatable, thats facts! </p>

<p>Btw Jordan was 1st in TS%, rTS% and fg% among SGs. But thats not the point. The Point is Jordan was more efficient compared than Wilt compared to league average.</p>

<p>You argue against a SG who was more efficient on better percantages and scored more per 100 than a 7&rsquo;2 C. That&rsquo;s just hilarious tbh. </p>

<p>Wilts 4k total points will never be cleared, his scoring rate was, by more players than just Jordan. </p>

<p>Wilts total averages were highly inflated by his time. With context his 40.5 per 100/ 50.4 ppg is still highly impressive, but not as overwhelming as it might seem.</p>

<p>On per 100 possessions it was cleared by Jordan, Kobe, Embiid, Giannis, Harden, Doncic</p>

      <label for="llarrrp" class="commentText"><p>My man can you read??? You cannot use rTS% to compare different years and different eras. That is literally the entire point of the TS+ stat. Its entire purpose is to do that.</p>

<p> TS+ compares the player to league average then adjusts for the different efficiencies on a per year basis. rTS does not accurately do this, FG% and TS% also obviously don’t do this either. </p>

<p>I’ll give you an example with made up numbers. Imagine the league average TS% was 10% due to whatever reason. Now someone (player 1) was unreal in that league and averaged a 20% TS%. So he shoots 2 times as good as the average, so his TS+ would be 200 while his rTS% would be +10%. If player 1 took all his team’s shots This would lead to double his teams normal points if his team shot at league average TS%</p>

<p>Now in another year let’s say the league average TS% was 50% and someone (player 2) shot 61% for their TS% that year. This means that they shot 1.22 times better than league average, so their TS+ would be 122. Their rTS% would be +11%. If player 2 took all his team’s shots this would lead to his team scoring 1.22x their normal points if their team shot at league average TS%.</p>

<p>Now if we use your methods of comparing them, you would conclude that player 2 is the more efficient scorer compared to league average. But that is clearly not the case as player 1 is much more efficient compared to the rest of the league. This is what you are doing. Please stop doing this. </p>

It&rsquo;s only really usable for 2 offensive players with similar scoring mechanics. 2 players like wilt or Jordan score so differently that it&rsquo;s quite meaningless of a stat, as their position would change very differently with different pace.</p>

      <label for="ll9162n" class="commentText"><p>Bird&rsquo;s 86 campaign is worth your consideration:</p>

<p>Regular season: 25.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.8  with 2.0 steals and 0.6 blocks. He played 82 games, 38 minutes per game.</p>

<p>Playoffs: 25.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.2 with 2.1 steals and 0.6 blocks.</p>

<p>Wins MVP, Finals MVP and the Championship.</p>

<p>Celtics set the all time home record (40-1).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Magic has a season where he dominates and brings everything home. But I&rsquo;ll let the Lakers fans decide which season best represents that.</p>

      <label for="ll9j7dc" class="commentText"><p>Luka is a ball-dominant helio, very unlike Bird, who often operated off-ball and within the system. People see the assist numbers and the highlights and assume he was a point forward like LeBron or something but that’s not actually how he generally played.</p>

<p>Luka’s also one of the players who is a great scorer but not really a particularly noteworthy pure shooter. Very different from Bird, who is one of the greatest pure shooters ever.</p>

<p>Defensively Bird was good, Luka is not. That part’s cut and dry.</p>

<p>Touch? You already said Jokic, and Jokic’s touch is better than Luka’s (Jokic probably has the best touch in the league, not a knock on Luka). So what does the Luka component of your hybrid comparison actually add?</p>

<p>Yeah, just doesn’t make sense in the slightest.</p>

      <label for="llb6tio" class="commentText"><p>You are completely misunderstanding the point of the comp. The person above posted that he&rsquo;d never seen Bird play and couldn&rsquo;t understand that he could be so good.</p>

<p>I said he was better and, as a comparison for <strong>dominance</strong>, it was like a Luka/Jokic hybrid.</p>

<p>Why? Because those are the only players right now who dominate the pace and flow of the game and do it with verve.</p>

<p>Ant doesn&rsquo;t. Durant doesn&rsquo;t. LBJ did but that doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>

<p>The Luka part of the comparison is the head scratchingly, you can&rsquo;t believe he f&rsquo;ing made the shot in the clutch. When Luka has the ball in late game situations, it feels very much like Bird. Inevitable. Guy won&rsquo;t rattle. There is an aura that no one else matches.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with what you wrote around different aspects of their games, more that I think you are a little focused on details when I was painting very broadly for the incredulous poster to whom I originally replied.</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t see much difference between 90 and 91. He didn&rsquo;t suddenly play team ball better. That was change happened in the 90 playoff where MJ played a point and solidified when Phil Jackson became a Bulls HC in 90. So I take MJ&rsquo;s comment to mean that winning a championship should be a tiebreaker.</p>

      <label for="ll97y4u" class="commentText"><p>If we’re just talking regular season and we’re not necessarily talking about how successful the team was, I have a hard time saying that any season MJ had in the late ‘80’s was clearly the best of all time, especially considering that you picked a year where he doesn’t win the MVP.</p>

<p>You can make the argument that, in 2009, Lebron was carrying a bigger offensive load and elevating his team more despite clear roster deficiencies, and that he was similarly effective on defense. 2016 Curry also comes to mind, just off pure offensive power. Curry in February that year averaged 40 points shooting 50% from 3. That’s disgusting. There’s a plurality of MVPs with absurd stat lines and achievements.</p>

<p>I will say, I don’t think there should be any disagreement that MJ is the clear cut greatest two way guard ever. Even if you don’t think his DPOY is valid, he was clearly a lethal perimeter threat that dissuaded offenses from passing too much. Speaking of which, for a shooting guard, he was pretty great at making plays for his teammates, in conjunction with being the greatest scorer ever. Late 80’s/early 90’s MJ is arguably the greatest multi-year peak of any player ever, and it’s self-evident as for why.</p>

<p>He’s not my GOAT but he’s a lot of people’s GOAT for a damn good reason.</p>

      <label for="ll9vmjy" class="commentText"><p>Lebron making his teammates better? 
That&rsquo;s a narrative that couldnt be farther from the truth.</p>

<p>Lets have a look at his side kicks: 3 years Sample size:</p>

<p>Wade:</p>

<p>Before Lebron: 27.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.1</p>

<p>With LeBron: 22.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.9</p>

<p>Bosh:</p>

<p>Before Lebron: <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.0</p>

<p>With Lebron: 17.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.0</p>

<p>AD:</p>

<p>Before Lebron: 27.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.4</p>

<p>With Lebron: 24.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.4</p>

<p>Love:</p>

<p>Before Lebron: 25.1/13/3.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.5</p>

<p>With Lebron: 17.1/10/2.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.5</p>

<p>Kyrie: * we  have to take the after with him cause of age (26- 28):</p>

<p>After Lebron: 25.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.6</p>

<p>With Lebron: 23.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.3</p>

<p>Notice a pattern?</p>

The idea is that you&rsquo;re both there to take pressure off each other so neither one of you have to carry as much as you did when you were alone.</p>

<p>Westbrooks stat improved astronomically when KD left, not because KD was a bad teammate but because his usage shot way up when he wasn&rsquo;t sharing the floor with a futer HOFer anymore.</p>

<p>Not 1 of his Star teammates got better! </p>

<p>Sure you got to sacrifice. Guess who never sacrificed - Lebron.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not making teammates better. That&rsquo;s gimping them.
Making teammates better also means let them be themselfs. Everybody has to Change their game, everybody but Lebron. That is not making teammates better!</p>

<p>Shouldnt their advanced stats increase because they are more efficient playing with Lebron? </p>

      <label for="ll907bw" class="commentText"><p>As a shooter sure, but that&rsquo;s about it. IMO he was a more accurate passer back then, certainly more dangerous going to the rim, and defensively you&rsquo;re comparing an elite defender to a bad one.</p>

<p>It looks closer than it is because of how much the game changed to make life easier for ball dominant perimeter players. 2009 LeBron in 2018 spacing is a different player, and he already had an elite 3pt cast for the era.</p>

      <label for="ll90r5y" class="commentText"><p>He was a good defender in 2018 when he chose to be (that playoff run). He was a better shooter in 2018 and actually had a post game. The 2011 finals meltdown would never happen to 2018 lebron because of the skills he added post 2011. His basketball iq was prolly better in 2018 and the game had already opened up by 2009.</p>

<p>From a statistical standpoint, it’s hard to argue against 2009. Especially in the playoffs - even though they didn’t make it to the finals.</p>

<p>My eye and gut tell me that 2013 was Lebron’s absolute peak. His defence, athleticism, shooting, all came together. And I think he was more aggressive when he needed to be than later on.</p>

<p>Still, it’s hard to argue against 2016. His IQ and feel for the game became his best quality. That finals was way, way more impressive to me than his 2018 finals. Those numbers are slightly inflated because of how weak the starting lineup was in 2018.</p>

<p>Obviously 2018 Lebron was still legendary. But I’d take 2009, 2013, 2016, and probably 2012 Lebron over 2018. Maybe even 2020, but that’s probably a stretch.</p>

      <label for="ll9134h" class="commentText"><p>The only knock on 2013 is that Finals, where he fell into a ton of the same issues everyone thought he&rsquo;d gotten over in 2012. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an argument for any season after that due to the defensive drop-off, even though his scoring became more polished.</p>

      <label for="ll9d62u" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, exactly. I feel like 2018 probably wouldn’t be as memorable if Kyrie was still on the team.</p>

<p>2018 just puts a magnifying glass on how good second-stint cavaliers LeBron truly was, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that he was better in 2018.</p>

      <label for="ll91dq3" class="commentText"><p>Those 2018 playoff games, he was manipulating the hell out of every possession. There&rsquo;s an argument for the Miami Bron as being better, but the mental processing puts 2018 ahead of his earlier Cavs stint IMO.</p>

      <label for="ll8wfnc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it shouldn’t be used as a knock on Lebron because you have to play the teams in front of you. But I think people tend to forget how bad the east was during the second Cleveland stint.</p>

<p>2018 he beat a sorry Pacers team, a frightened raptors team (who imo had regressed from 2016), and a baby Boston squad. Hard to think of one legit, elite, contending team in the east outside of the Cavs in that period.</p>

<p>EDIT: The pacers were a legit good team imo but I think they were only relevant during the Miami years, no? So was Boston from 2008-2012 obviously.</p>

<p>But from 2015-2018 the best team they faced was probably Atlanta? Maybe the 2016 Raptors but even as a fan I don’t think so.</p>

When Jeff Green is your third option in the finals you need to be getting shit done for real</p>

<p>Same as when Timofey Mosgov was the 2nd leader in points for the Cavs 2015 finals. When a guy like that steps up LeBron can&rsquo;t just get these excuses and context smh</p>
