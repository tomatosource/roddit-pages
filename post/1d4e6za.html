</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My (F53) soon to be ex husband Roger (47), whom I forgave for his affair, came home with a baby four months ago. His girlfriend (22) could not handle it anymore and brought the baby to him at work and left. To the best of his knowledge she is in Spain.</p>

<p>I allowed him to stay so long as I didn&rsquo;t have to do anything. Anything.</p>

<p>Well about a month ago Roger had a heart attack. It didn&rsquo;t kill him, mores the pity, but he is very weak and  incapable of doing anything for himself. Since he isn&rsquo;t up and about he cannot care for his child. He also cannot drop of and pick up his son at daycare.</p>

<p>I have been helping but I&rsquo;m done. My kids are full grown. I shouldn&rsquo;t be having grandkids any time soon. I do not have any desire to care for a baby.</p>

<p>I told Roger that I want a divorce, and I contacted the mother&rsquo;s parents. I know the father through friends. I said they had until Friday to come get their grandchild or I was calling Child Protective Services.</p>

<p>They just left with the baby. But they scolded me for being so cold towards a baby that had done me no harm. I view that child differently.</p>

<p>Roger is recovering and I will be moving out. The house is in his name but I have never contributed to it. I have the equivalent of twenty two years of rent and interest put away. And as per our prenup my savings are my own.</p>

<p>I work and I don&rsquo;t need anything out of this marriage except myself.</p>

<p>My kids tried telling me to stay and help their father. I said that they were welcome to come over and help him with cleaning himself and the baby. Both declined what I felt was a fair offer.</p>

<p>I do not feel that I am acting badly however Roger, our children, his child&rsquo;s family, and a few mutual friends think I am. Perhaps writing this out and seeing the responses will give me clarity.</p>

Your kids don&rsquo;t want to help, Roger can&rsquo;t help.  This child isn&rsquo;t your problem or responsibility unless you make the child your problem or responsibility.  The child may be innocent, but you are too.  You didn&rsquo;t ask Roger to cheat on you and get another woman pregnant.  You didn&rsquo;t ask to take care of an affair baby.</p>

      <label for="l6fdnsb" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s likely the parents felt ashamed that their daughter abandoned the baby with a married man twice her age that she had an affair with. I&rsquo;m not judging her all that hard - she&rsquo;s 22 and we have no idea how much she knew before this affair started. Maybe she had no idea he was married, and maybe she told OP&rsquo;s husband she was having his baby and he provided no help for the baby he was equally responsible for making.</p>

<p>But the parents are likely trying to put some of the blame on the most innocent person in this situation because she&rsquo;s the person who&rsquo;s in front of them and hasn&rsquo;t just had a heart attack. The 22yo GF shouldn&rsquo;t have just abandoned the baby with OP&rsquo;s husband, but we know OP&rsquo;s husband cheated with a woman half his age, so I basically don&rsquo;t believe any story he tells.</p>

She could have just called CPS right away instead of contacting the grandparents. She could also move out and leave her soon to be ex with a young toddler to care for.

<p>she didn&rsquo;t mistreat the baby she just refused to take care of it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not like she let it languish and die when the husband had a heart attack.  She did the right thing as far as not just dropping the baby off at a hospital or something, but has no responsibility beyond basic safety and human decency (get your blood relative or I will safely relinquish it to authorities).</p>

<p>Having been cheated on she&rsquo;s already better than I am&hellip;  (??? define better I suppose) I was unable to forgive the affair (my ex also refused to stop seeing the guy when the marriage counselor told her she needed to cut it off).  There was a pregnancy in my case as well but it was ectopic so non-viable.  Paternity was never determined.  [/getting off this rant now]</p>

<p>Anyway OP is NTA at all in any of this and IMO has acted admirably all things considered.  The *only* two cents I would toss in is be careful of alienating your kids OP&hellip; their dad is a jackass that disrespected you and is now an albatros if you stay, yes, but he is still your kids&rsquo; dad; how you treat him is indirectly felt by your kids.  By no means do I mean that you should stay and be his caretaker if you don&rsquo;t want to!  Just be mindful of how your actions will look to your kids and perhaps choose words and timing of things carefully.</p>

I mean long term, yeah it&rsquo;s a liability for sure, but in the immediate time frame I doubt there are many jurisdictions that would give OP trouble if they took the child to the hospital for care of whatever ailment appears to be present at any given moment.</p>

<p>Technically for OP’s kids, that’s their sibling so by their reasoning shouldn’t they be taking care of baby and their cheating dad?</p>

<p>Cheating, affair baby, and then an abandoned affair baby. Marriage vows at this point are very much broken. OP tried to rise above it but I’m not sure there is any way to put this marriage back together. Everyone around OP is treating her as if her needs and wants don’t matter. That’s just BS. No judgment from me on the decisions she’s made for herself.</p>

<p>STBX has to fix this. Then he needs to get fixed.</p>

<p>Good that the mother of the baby recognized she can’t take care of a child &amp; did not harm it. But perhaps she also should not have been having unprotected sex with a married man? Or unprotected sex period?</p>

What they’re demanding is that she stays to take care of her husband and his affair baby after a medical incident. She already accepted the cheating part; what she doesn’t want is to be held responsible for the baby.</p>

<p>So her adult kids see her abandoning their enfeebled elderly father for something she already said she was okay with. She’s still NTA for the divorce but I don’t think her kids are TAs in this scenario either; they’re just responding to what they’ve been taught</p>

There are blood relatives to take care of the child absolutely no need for you to, I have no idea why anyone expects you to 🤷‍♀️The child is better with blood relatives who love it, I don’t understand why others don’t see that.   </p>

<p>Divorce your husband asap, he wasn’t your responsibility the minute he had an affair. </p>

<p>IMO everyone else is just wanting you to look after the child and your husband so they don’t have to but you’re not on this earth to carry other peoples responsibilities. You’ve  raised your children, looked after your husband until he broke his vows and I’m sure you’ll help with grandchildren.  </p>

<p>You’re a good person walk away with your head held high and refuse to discuss it as you have a clear conscience. </p>

Don&rsquo;t walk away without getting all that is yours. You said that you have 22 years worth of savings.

<p>NTA OP, you go buy yourself a peaceful place to call home and enjoy the fruits of your labour!! Go out with friends, travel, visit your grown kids and treat yourself! You&rsquo;ve earned it.</p>

<p>Roger also is reaping what he sowed and so are his parents. Didn&rsquo;t teach your son to not stcik his willy in young girls, here&rsquo;s a baby so you can try again!</p>

It’s weird they wouldn’t want to take the kid in anyway. Poor child… your grown kids can take care of their dad. When he cheated, your relationship ended and he’s not your problem anymore</p>

<p>Poor OP can’t win in the eyes of these aholes. But we know she’s more than justified of washing her hands of her stbx, his infant and his AP’s parents. Good riddance. </p>

<p>Usually it involves quitting smoking and changing their diet.</p>

<p>Also Lipitor and/or whatever other modern cholesterol-lowering prescriptions.</p>

<p>Anyway, ten bucks says if AP doesn&rsquo;t come back from Spain and take back up with the cheating Dad, the cheating Dad will recover and marry a different woman lickety-split.  One who is willing to play Mommy.  And that might be the very best thing.  Especially if this dude has money and prestige, there will be women lined up to take on the role and they won&rsquo;t have the baggage that OP does as far as this baby&rsquo;s provenance, and that&rsquo;s not saying anything bad about OP.  Ten bucks says when OP is gone, her husband recovers, marries a different woman in thirty seconds flat, and pawns the work off on her.</p>

      <label for="l6dvwc4" class="commentText"><p>NTA - let me get this straight though - no one is upset at the real mom who took off for Spain leaving her kid?  It seems like all the hostility is being misdirected toward you who got dumped on more than once.  You are doing the right thing. At some point mom is more than likely going to show back up, want the kid and money to support it.  Get away from that man as fast as you can.</p>

<p>As far as your kids go, it sounds like they think you have some responsibility to support the guy who cheated on you for life so they can enjoy theirs without that added burden. Hopefully they will wake up and realize that is placing you in an abusive situation.  Wait until Roger passes, and they all want a part of the house and little miss guess who (if she finds out) wants a piece for her kid too.  I bet their opinions change real fast.</p>

Like, every year she said they wanna spend holidays with him because it might be his last one. Dude was a fighter, and held on til a couple months ago. But the last <strong><em>two years</em></strong> of his life, he needed someone with him, full time.</p>

<p>Her dad stopped living with her mom to live with his father, and it just sounds like one of the worst experiences to have to live through. He could go out for like 30 minutes to grab stuff from the store and get back home, but otherwise he had to coordinate someone else to be there with him.</p>

<p>When he passed, it was one of those things that was more like a sad relief for everyone involved, grandfather included. We had a brief talk because I was worried since she&rsquo;s so close with her parents that I can&rsquo;t do that. I can&rsquo;t do years where she doesn&rsquo;t live with me, and she&rsquo;s the caretaker for her parents like that. It was brief because she agreed.</p>

<p>But fuck, man. That&rsquo;s such a hard situation to have to be in</p>

<ol>
<li>Roger - for having an affair and getting someone not his wife pregnant.</li>
<li>The affair girl - for having an affair, getting pregnant and then dumping her baby with the duplicitous person.</li>
<li>The affair girl&rsquo;s parents - for being so rude to the OP.</li>
<li>OP&rsquo;s kids - for expecting their mother to continue to help their dad even after such duplicitous behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>The only two non-assholes are the OP and the baby - neither of which asked to be put in this mess.</p>

Then there is suddenly a kud amd he should taking care of but is having a heart attack. And now he doesn’t arrange any care like the grandparents or a nanny, but easily shoves the care for him ánd his kid to her. I get that it will gives her a resemtment against the forgiving and doesn’t want this kind of life. I mean why didnt he call the gp and asked then to take the baby when he was able to talk?</p>

Who technically has legal custody at this point? Can you even contact the mother to tell her you’re calling CPS to take away the baby she abandoned? Does your soon to be ex husband even have the faculties to inquire about his baby? Does he care enough to?  This is a giant mess, and none of it is yours to have to deal with.</p>

You&rsquo;ve already shown incredible patience and forgiveness towards your husband&rsquo;s affair, but being expected to care for a child born out of his infidelity is beyond reasonable. You&rsquo;ve upheld your end of the bargain by allowing him to stay, but it&rsquo;s not your responsibility to raise his child while he recovers. You made a tough but necessary decision in involving CPS to ensure the child&rsquo;s welfare and your own well-being.</p>

It&rsquo;s not your child and you don&rsquo;t want to raise it so you contacted the grandparents. Roger, your kids and everyone else can go suck eggs. Blood relatives IMO have a lot more obligation to step up to raise this kid than the STBX wife of its father.</p>

<p>Also, can&rsquo;t any of these people who think you should raise the kid visit it, contribute financially, help out the grandparents occasionally? No? They just think they can tell YOU to do all the work? F that.</p>

      <label for="l6dyoge" class="commentText"><p>NTA. The people who should be scolded by the child&rsquo;s grandparents is their daughter for sleeping with a married man and abandoning her child, and your husband for breaking his vows and disrespecting you. They are projecting and misdirecting their anger because deep down know their daughter and your husband created this mess, not you.</p>

<p>You are not being unfair, you are not acting badly. The AHs are those, including your children, who think you should accept a situation that was not of your making, and also refusing to help their own father. Your feelings are valid. If you want out of this marriage, which has been harmed by your husband&rsquo;s infidelity, you have every right to leave it. Remind your children that their father no only cheated on you but had unprotected sex, meaning he could have infected you with a disease.</p>

They expect you to tolerate everything to keep the environment intact just the way they want. Just focus on yourself and don&rsquo;t forget others treat you in your tough times. Those are the ones you should not trust</p>

Not your circus, not your monkeys.</p>

<p>I would have left the minute he brought the kid home.</p>

<p>I don’t know how your kids and mutual friends can even think you’re wrong after what he’s already put you through then add a baby on top of it!
Roger and the baby’s family don’t want to have to do the dirty work so, of course, they’re going to do everything to make you feel bad. Tell them to pound sand!</p>

      <label for="l6e2jh7" class="commentText"><p>It has been observed that individuals are often quick to judge and criticize others for not providing assistance. However, when these same individuals are asked to contribute, they frequently claim they are too busy or that the request is unfair. It is important to recognize that meaningful input should come from those who are willing to actively participate and help. In this particular situation, the primary responsibility for the child rests with the soon-to-be ex and the child&rsquo;s mother. Your ex nor the baby is your responsibility. NTA</p>

<p>My kids tried telling me to stay and help their father. I said that they were welcome to come over and help him with cleaning himself and the baby. Both declined what I felt was a fair offer.</p>

<p>I do not feel that I am acting badly however Roger, our children, his child&rsquo;s family, and a few mutual friends think I am. Perhaps writing this out and seeing the responses will give me clarity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All those telling you that you&rsquo;re in the wrong, offer them to come over and look after him and the baby, i suspect the reaction will be the same as your children. Yes, the baby is innocent in all this but that shouldn&rsquo;t mean that you have to give up your life to raise it. The child has parents and grandparents, they can do it.  NTA, not even close</p>

He cheated, got stuck with the baby because baby mama left and now everyone wants you to make nice and stay to take care of hubby.  You offered your kids the opportunity to take care of their father but they want no part of it - so why should they expect you to take care of him?</p>

<p>Find yourself a nice place, take care of yourself and have a wonderful life.  Wishing you the best.</p>
