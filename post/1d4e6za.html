</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My (F53) soon to be ex husband Roger (47), whom I forgave for his affair, came home with a baby four months ago. His girlfriend (22) could not handle it anymore and brought the baby to him at work and left. To the best of his knowledge she is in Spain.</p>

<p>I allowed him to stay so long as I didn&rsquo;t have to do anything. Anything.</p>

<p>Well about a month ago Roger had a heart attack. It didn&rsquo;t kill him, mores the pity, but he is very weak and  incapable of doing anything for himself. Since he isn&rsquo;t up and about he cannot care for his child. He also cannot drop of and pick up his son at daycare.</p>

<p>I have been helping but I&rsquo;m done. My kids are full grown. I shouldn&rsquo;t be having grandkids any time soon. I do not have any desire to care for a baby.</p>

<p>I told Roger that I want a divorce, and I contacted the mother&rsquo;s parents. I know the father through friends. I said they had until Friday to come get their grandchild or I was calling Child Protective Services.</p>

<p>They just left with the baby. But they scolded me for being so cold towards a baby that had done me no harm. I view that child differently.</p>

<p>Roger is recovering and I will be moving out. The house is in his name but I have never contributed to it. I have the equivalent of twenty two years of rent and interest put away. And as per our prenup my savings are my own.</p>

<p>I work and I don&rsquo;t need anything out of this marriage except myself.</p>

<p>My kids tried telling me to stay and help their father. I said that they were welcome to come over and help him with cleaning himself and the baby. Both declined what I felt was a fair offer.</p>

<p>I do not feel that I am acting badly however Roger, our children, his child&rsquo;s family, and a few mutual friends think I am. Perhaps writing this out and seeing the responses will give me clarity.</p>

Your kids don&rsquo;t want to help, Roger can&rsquo;t help.  This child isn&rsquo;t your problem or responsibility unless you make the child your problem or responsibility.  The child may be innocent, but you are too.  You didn&rsquo;t ask Roger to cheat on you and get another woman pregnant.  You didn&rsquo;t ask to take care of an affair baby.</p>

<p>This is why a couple needs to divorce when an affair child is in the picture. I’ve read at least 5 posts in the last year about the innocent partner getting stuck for one reason or another and then has to leave because it’s too much</p>

She could have just called CPS right away instead of contacting the grandparents. She could also move out and leave her soon to be ex with a young toddler to care for. I think she has chosen the best path forward for both herself and the child. Best wishes, OP.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not like she let it languish and die when the husband had a heart attack.  She did the right thing as far as not just dropping the baby off at a hospital or something, but has no responsibility beyond basic safety and human decency (get your blood relative or I will safely relinquish it to authorities).</p>

<p>Having been cheated on she&rsquo;s already better than I am&hellip;  (??? define better I suppose) I was unable to forgive the affair (my ex also refused to stop seeing the guy when the marriage counselor told her she needed to cut it off).  There was a pregnancy in my case as well but it was ectopic so non-viable.  Paternity was never determined.  [/getting off this rant now]</p>

<p>Anyway OP is NTA at all in any of this and IMO has acted admirably all things considered.  The *only* two cents I would toss in is be careful of alienating your kids OP&hellip; their dad is a jackass that disrespected you and is now an albatros if you stay, yes, but he is still your kids&rsquo; dad; how you treat him is indirectly felt by your kids.  By no means do I mean that you should stay and be his caretaker if you don&rsquo;t want to!  Just be mindful of how your actions will look to your kids and perhaps choose words and timing of things carefully.</p>

She does not have anything in writing, allowing her to consent to medical treatment, for instance. If something were to happen to this baby, she would not be able to do anything.</p>

      <label for="l6eg5qh" class="commentText"><p>Current conditions would qualify as emergency circumstances and given bio mom is in Spain I assume this isn&rsquo;t in the US, but at least here good samaritan laws would still protect OP if they provided lifesaving care in good faith.  I mean long term, yeah it&rsquo;s a liability for sure, but in the immediate time frame I doubt there are many jurisdictions that would give OP trouble if they took the child to the hospital for care of whatever ailment appears to be present at any given moment.</p>

What they’re demanding is that she stays to take care of her husband and his affair baby after a medical incident. She already accepted the cheating part; what she doesn’t want is to be held responsible for the baby.</p>

<p>So her adult kids see her abandoning their enfeebled elderly father for something she already said she was okay with. She’s still NTA for the divorce but I don’t think her kids are TAs in this scenario either; they’re just responding to what they’ve been taught</p>

There are blood relatives to take care of the child absolutely no need for you to, I have no idea why anyone expects you to 🤷‍♀️The child is better with blood relatives who love it, I don’t understand why others don’t see that.   </p>

<p>Divorce your husband asap, he wasn’t your responsibility the minute he had an affair. </p>

<p>IMO everyone else is just wanting you to look after the child and your husband so they don’t have to but you’re not on this earth to carry other peoples responsibilities. You’ve  raised your children, looked after your husband until he broke his vows and I’m sure you’ll help with grandchildren.  </p>

<p>You’re a good person walk away with your head held high and refuse to discuss it as you have a clear conscience. </p>

It seems like all the hostility is being misdirected toward you who got dumped on more than once.  You are doing the right thing. At some point mom is more than likely going to show back up, want the kid and money to support it.  Get away from that man as fast as you can.</p>

<p>As far as your kids go, it sounds like they think you have some responsibility to support the guy who cheated on you for life so they can enjoy theirs without that added burden. Hopefully they will wake up and realize that is placing you in an abusive situation.  Wait until Roger passes, and they all want a part of the house and little miss guess who (if she finds out) wants a piece for her kid too.  I bet their opinions change real fast.</p>

<p>You have no responsibility to take on the childcare, nor to take care of your husband after he betrayed you and your marriage. You have every right to have the child’s maternal family take over, as well as to divorce. If any of your children wish to see either of them taken care of, they are perfectly capable of stepping in.</p>

<p>You may want to consider individual therapy to help you process your emotions around it all, if you aren’t already. You’ve been through a lot, it sounds like it’s created some understandable resentment and hurt.</p>

      <label for="l6e2iwk" class="commentText"><p>Can I just take a moment to emphasize the fact that a 47 year old married man knocked up a 22 year old woman. I don’t care what you want to say about both being consenting adults. He’s more than twice her age! And married! That’s disgusting. And then he just left her to deal with it? This man is trash. Yes, divorce him.</p>

<p>People can criticize all they want, but the fact of the matter is, you have literally no obligation to this child. You also have no rights to this child. Who technically has legal custody at this point? Can you even contact the mother to tell her you’re calling CPS to take away the baby she abandoned? Does your soon to be ex husband even have the faculties to inquire about his baby? Does he care enough to?  This is a giant mess, and none of it is yours to have to deal with.</p>

Blood relatives IMO have a lot more obligation to step up to raise this kid than the STBX wife of its father.</p>

<p>Also, can&rsquo;t any of these people who think you should raise the kid visit it, contribute financially, help out the grandparents occasionally? No? They just think they can tell YOU to do all the work? F that.</p>

The people who should be scolded by the child&rsquo;s grandparents is their daughter for sleeping with a married man and abandoning her child, and your husband for breaking his vows and disrespecting you. They are projecting and misdirecting their anger because deep down know their daughter and your husband created this mess, not you.</p>

<p>You are not being unfair, you are not acting badly. The AHs are those, including your children, who think you should accept a situation that was not of your making, and also refusing to help their own father. Your feelings are valid. If you want out of this marriage, which has been harmed by your husband&rsquo;s infidelity, you have every right to leave it. Remind your children that their father no only cheated on you but had unprotected sex, meaning he could have infected you with a disease.</p>

<p>I would have left the minute he brought the kid home.</p>

<p>I don’t know how your kids and mutual friends can even think you’re wrong after what he’s already put you through then add a baby on top of it!
Roger and the baby’s family don’t want to have to do the dirty work so, of course, they’re going to do everything to make you feel bad. Tell them to pound sand!</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks that it&rsquo;s OK for you to suddenly take on the responsibilities of raising his affair baby, especially at your age,  is delusional and welcome to walk the walk themselves.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got your ducks in a row in anticipation for leaving. Roger&rsquo;s about to find out why it&rsquo;s a bad idea to cheat when you don&rsquo;t have a support system in place if ill health strikes you down.</p>

<p>I wish you all the best.</p>

      <label for="l6e2jh7" class="commentText"><p>It has been observed that individuals are often quick to judge and criticize others for not providing assistance. However, when these same individuals are asked to contribute, they frequently claim they are too busy or that the request is unfair. It is important to recognize that meaningful input should come from those who are willing to actively participate and help. In this particular situation, the primary responsibility for the child rests with the soon-to-be ex and the child&rsquo;s mother. Your ex nor the baby is your responsibility. NTA</p>

      <label for="l6ebxwc" class="commentText"><p>Everyone criticizing you is doing so because they&rsquo;re not willing to put up what what you&rsquo;ve been doing, and don&rsquo;t want to be the next in line for psychological caretaking torture.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll forgive you quickly as soon as he&rsquo;s placed in a situation that doesn&rsquo;t jeopardize them not having to lift a finger to take care of a selfish douchebag.</p>

<p>Taking care of an abandoned affair child and a husband that can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t help you? Fuck that. Regardless of what people are telling you, nobody believes this is fair, likely including your husband.</p>

<p>As far as your husband&rsquo;s well-being is concerned: tell everyone that if he didn&rsquo;t rawdog a 22 year old Spanish girl, he would have a caretaker but he did, and now he doesn&rsquo;t. You sticking around would literally break the logic of the universe.</p>

      <label for="l6ebzr7" class="commentText"><p>NTA. I love how this affair partner’s parents are scolding you for not wanting to take care of your husband’s affair baby, when their daughter abandoned her baby and flew off to Spain. Projection much? They should be scolding her and apologizing to you.</p>

<p>As for not wanting to take care of your husband, it sounds like you helped him through the worst of it. Your kids/friends can’t guilt trip you about it because it’s not like they’re willing to step up and help. Actions have consequences and your husband is in the finding out phase. You would be there for him if he hadn’t betrayed you</p>

Bless you for not making it the child&rsquo;s problem by being honest about your feelings. Also, it&rsquo;s cruel for them to expect you to just be ok taking responsibility for the product of your husband&rsquo;s infidelity, and if it&rsquo;s such a huge deal to any of them they should&rsquo;ve been there as soon as he fell ill!</p>

<p>Legally, you have no ties to that child. What if the child had gotten sick, or injured?</p>

<p>Hospital staff: And the name of your child?<br>
OP: Oh, it&rsquo;s not my child.<br>
HS:&hellip;whose child is it?<br>
OP: My STBX-husband and his mistress.<br>
HS:&hellip;and where is the father?<br>
OP: At home, he had a heart attack and can&rsquo;t function on his own. His children refuse to come care for him and the baby.<br>
HS:&hellip;and the mother?<br>
OP: Fled the country after abandoning the baby with my husband.<br>
HS:&hellip;.<em>Grabbing the baby.</em> We&rsquo;re&hellip;going to be right back, after <del>making a phone call</del> running a few tests.</p>

<p>You may have been cold, but I think you made the responsible choice. If your husband can&rsquo;t care for his son and if the boy&rsquo;s half-siblings won&rsquo;t care for him or their father, the next kinship tie is grandparents.</p>

      <label for="l6empj2" class="commentText"><p>NTA! But why did you forgive him?&hellip;an affair is bad enough, but he brought home a living, breathing reminder of that betrayal.</p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t matter now that his health is declining. No one gets to tell you how or when to heal or better yet if you ever can/will heal. Not sure what&rsquo;s made you decide that you&rsquo;ve had enough, and there&rsquo;s no salvaging the marriage, but be firm and stick to whatever decision you finalize.</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s your husband&rsquo;s relatives? Or your in-laws? Let them deal with his needs regarding caretaking and fatherhood.</p>

<p>At 53 years old, you two were supposed to be living your empty nest, nearly retired best lives, and he fuq&rsquo;d up the foundation and marriage with his selfishness. An affair is awful, yet a $10 box of condoms would&rsquo;ve prevented the baby consequence, so yeah, gracefully remove yourself from the equation and go low to no contact with anyone that&rsquo;s trying to guilt you into becoming a hospice wife and mother to his affair child.</p>

<p>Also, did he groom the young lady? That&rsquo;s a nasty age gap between those two! He should be ashamed of himself for impregnanting the barely legal harlot.</p>

<p>What did they expect for you to do just be a pushover and say &ldquo;okay. I&rsquo;ll take care of your baby that you had while having an affair on me. Sure. I&rsquo;ll care of you and the child that you as an old man decided to have&hellip;..just for you to then go and have a heart attack after bringing in a child so late in life. But sure i&rsquo;m wrong for not wanting the stress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tell all those people that the only thing I could think as to why they were even think. It&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s because they expect you to do everything and anything for them. And I hope that&rsquo;s not the case. Where they take advantage of you, but if it is there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with saying no. And standing up for yourself</p>

<p>ALSO. The grandparents of that child need to focus on the fact that they didn&rsquo;t teach their daughter. Any moral integrity for her to wanna go &amp; have an affair with a married man. And then bring an innocent child into this world, knowing what that child would face. Children don&rsquo;t deserve to come into broken. Homes is bad enough when a things happen and they break. But to knowingly bring a child into a mess like this with affairs and adultery, it&rsquo;s not right</p>
