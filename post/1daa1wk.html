      <p>Game 1 done.</p>

<p>Thank you to the r/NBA mods for letting us set up this AMA for y&rsquo;all. We&rsquo;ll have DMN reporters Mike Curtis and Kevin Sherrington, and Globe reporters Adam Himmelsbach and Khari Thompson online at 11 a.m. CT (12 p.m. EST) to answer your NBA Finals/Dallas Mavericks/Boston Celtics questions. They&rsquo;ve set aside two hours of their day to get to as many of you as possible, however this is a <em>huge</em> subreddit and they may not get to everyone. Drop your questions below!</p>

<p>This is also our first time using Reddit&rsquo;s new AMA feature so <em>fingers crossed</em>.</p>

<p>11 a.m.: Let&rsquo;s get started! Co-hosts are noted. Kevin&rsquo;s account is very new and can&rsquo;t be designated as a co-host, but it is him.</p>

<p>u/MikeCurtis2: Hey, everyone! I’m Mike Curtis and I cover the Mavs for The Dallas Morning News. I’ve been on the beat for a couple of months after spending the last two seasons covering the Detroit Pistons for the The Detroit News.</p>

<p>u/KevinSherrington: Hey, Redditors, this is Kevin Sherrington, sports columnist at the Dallas Morning News. Been at this for a long time, covered lots of stuff. Once interviewed Dennis Rodman in a gay bar. So, yeah, ask me anything.</p>

<p>Adam (u/bostonglobe): Adam Himmelsbach joined the Globe in 2015 and covers the Celtics. A graduate of Syracuse University, Himmelsbach previously spent two years as a columnist at the Louisville Courier-Journal, and six years as a Washington-based contributor for The New York Times.</p>

<p>Khari (u/bostonglobe): Khari Thompson is a sportswriter covering the Celtics and Patriots for <a href="http://Boston.com" target="_blank">Boston.com</a> since 2022. His work is often featured in The Boston Globe and on <a href="http://bostonglobe.com/" target="_blank">bostonglobe.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 p.m.: That&rsquo;s all folks! Thank you for your questions and thank you again to the mods. Be sure to follow these reporters online for the rest of the finals.</p>

      <label for="l7jprge" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s always pretty cool to watch the trick shot competition Derrick White has going with some of the Celtics&rsquo; assistant coaches. Whether it&rsquo;s at home or on the road, D-White is always trying new stuff whether it&rsquo;s trying to kick the ball in from the top of the key, bounce it off the backboard or from around his back. He also works on catching and shooting off of bad passes a lot, which is an interesting drill to watch. You can see how it translates during games.</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s at home or on the road. I think it&rsquo;s a cool moment that&rsquo;ll stay with the kid for a long time.</p>

      <label for="l7j5n0a" class="commentText"><p>What changes do you see Dallas making regarding their defense?</p>

<p>It seemed like they were trying to stop Tatum and let other people beat them, but the Celtics have 2 other star players and 3 other guys who can any given night.</p>

<p>Seems like a matchup nightmare with no good option besides having multiple good wing defenders along with no switches to attack. Boston can attack Kyrie and Luka all game long and KP can shoot over anyone. Whenever Tatum or JB drive to the rim there&rsquo;s going to be a wide-open corner 3 or an &lsquo;easy&rdquo; layup or free throws.</p>

      <label for="l7jsxd3" class="commentText"><p>The Mavericks&rsquo; defense has been excellent since the team acquired Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington and Jason Kidd put Derrick Jones Jr. back in the starting lineup, and the conference finals win over the Wolves provided another example of that.</p>

<p>But Minnesota is unique in that Anthony Edwards was the only player who was a real threat as a 3-point shooting slasher. The Celtics often have four of them on the court at once. Most of them are not at Edwards&rsquo;s level, but it&rsquo;s just so much for a defense to account for and it makes it impossible to hide Doncic and Irving. -Adam</p>

      <label for="l7jxh67" class="commentText"><p>The Mavs talked a lot about their defense last night, but they have to score. 89 points in the NBA Finals may have worked in the early 2000s, but not in 2024. If you look at the quarter splits, Boston won the first two quarters (37-20, 26-22) and Dallas won the latter two (24-23, 23-21). That first quarter left the Mavs shellshocked, especially after Porzingis&rsquo; dominance on both ends of the floor. The final three quarters makes me believe this will be a more competitive series than what Game 1 showed us.</p>

      <label for="l7jnzcj" class="commentText"><p>If KP plays like he did in the first half the rest of this series, well, it&rsquo;ll be a short one. But if the Mavs can do what they did in the second, which is to be as physical with him as they&rsquo;ve been with all the other bigs in these playoffs, well, their chances improve greatly. The Mavs have got to hit some 3s from the corners to draw attention from Luka and Kyrie. It&rsquo;d help if they had more offense off the bench.</p>

      <label for="l7jt64x" class="commentText"><p>They might get forced into zone if Luka can’t stop letting guys get around him. They play to funnel guys to bigs, so normally there’s no issue there, but unless Luka provides back pressure they’re not going to have much trouble beating Dallas’ bigs 1 on 1 at the rim. If he does provide back pressure instead of rotating to the big’s man then it means someone is getting left wide open because once the driver has got Luka on their back it means the big needs to fully commit to stop a free bucket.</p>

<p>If Luka can’t stop getting blown by a zone would at least let them hide him on the back line. That would open up a whole new set of issues though because this Celtics team has no problem shooting over a zone or sticking Tatum or KP in the middle of it to attack from the free throw line.</p>

      <label for="l7kydmw" class="commentText"><p>This seems to be the most logical answer I&rsquo;ve heard from the Mavs side of things. Instead of their trite and banal&hellip;oh don&rsquo;t bet against Luka/Kyrie. If you switch everything and have Lively room to protect the paint and force Celtics off the 3 point line than Mavs have a chance in Game 2. Except nobody on the Mavs can stop Brown when he bull rushes it into the paint. </p>

<p>But, it&rsquo;s also a pretty awesome experience. Personally, it&rsquo;s also a chance to see so many other journalists from around the country who I&rsquo;ve become friends with over the years. Like a little family reunion. -Adam</p>

      <label for="l7jdhm2" class="commentText"><p>How do you grade Tatum’s performance? He was very good defensively, but offensively left more to be desired. He was good at handling the ball when he was double teamed but he still had some bone headed turnovers. His stats weren’t good but he was more impactful looking at the film.</p>

      <label for="l7jqu7v" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say it was an uneven performance by Tatum. At the start he seemed almost too focused on getting other guys involved and passed up some good looks in the process.</p>

<p>Much of the time, it was to find a better shot. But you also want Tatum to take good looks when they&rsquo;re there. Tatum admitted to being nervous, so maybe that factored into his start.</p>

<p>Midway through the third quarter Tatum had six turnovers and just eight points, and no free throws. Usually he finds his rhythm by attacking and getting to the foul line, and I&rsquo;d expect him make that more of an emphasis in Game 2.</p>

<p>But if a lukewarm Tatum game results in a blowout win anyway, I think the Celtics will be fine with that.   -Adam</p>

It&rsquo;s just so time consuming. But during the Finals the NBA hires a transcription service to handle all of that! Thank you, NBA!</p>

<p>But the access is generally worse, just because there are so many journalists and outlets pulling players in so many different directions. If I&rsquo;m at a road game in Sacramento in January, I can pretty much get a one-on-one interview with whoever I want. Not in the FInals.</p>

      <label for="l7jra15" class="commentText"><p>This is actually my first time covering the playoffs, let alone The Finals, so there&rsquo;s a newness factor for me. So far, the hardest part of Game 1 was navigating the enormous amount of people inside the arena. There&rsquo;s a ton of media here, so getting to the press conference rooms takes some pre-planning. Last night was a blowout so there was ample time to get there before the final buzzer. The easiest part is understanding that there are key storylines within the series and then asking questions based on those angles.</p>

      <label for="l7jwws3" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics want to win the 3-point attempt rate in every game, and it was clear that they believed there would be great chances against this Mavericks defense. I think 10 of their first 13 attempts came from beyond the arc, with simple ball movement leading to one open look after another.</p>

<p>Afterward, Dallas coach Jason Kidd was frustrated that his team had allowed the Celtics to set the tone by firing up 15 first-quarter 3-pointers.</p>

<p>On one trip downcourt, the Celtics actually took five 3-pointers. They missed them all, but gobbled up offensive rebounds and kept firing.</p>

<p>For the Mavericks, PJ Washington&rsquo;s 3-point shooting seems to have come back down to earth after his scorching semifinal series against the Thunder, and Dallas simply hasn&rsquo;t faced a team with a collection of perimeter ball-hawks like Boston&rsquo;s. But the 3-pointer is the great equalizer, and the Mavericks are the obvious underdogs in this series, so catching fire from beyond the arc will probably offer their best chance at an upset.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how the Heat stole Game 2 of their first-round series against Boston. -Adam</p>

Doncic&rsquo;s received the same treatment since the start of the playoffs. He&rsquo;s had solid moments defensively, but his best defense is his offense. As for Irving, he might need to stomp again to reverse the curse. Sarcasm, of course.</p>

      <label for="l7jwkje" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics&rsquo; biggest strength is their depth. The fact that they can get away with Tatum having as any turnovers as made field-goals (6) and still win a blowout in the Finals is insane. They rolled through the first three rounds without Porzingis. They legitimately have six guys that can take over a game on a given night.</p>

<p>Their biggest weakness is the Game 2 letdown. They&rsquo;re 1-2 in Game 2s this postseason. For whatever reason, they tend to lay one egg per series and it has pretty consistently come after a Game 1 win. -Khari</p>

He made strides after coming off shin surgery from last offseason. Their disastrous season, which included a league record 28 straight losses, definitely overshadowed it so I can see how he fell under the radar.</p>

<p>It seems as if he&rsquo;s back to 100%, playing at his peak in these finals, dropping 20 points and 3 blocks in his first game back; But, with reports just an hour before the game stating that KP is &ldquo;unsure about his playing ability&rdquo; in this finals series, do you think he needs to be put on a minutes restriction this series before an injury remerges?</p>

      <label for="l7ju5bk" class="commentText"><p>Kristaps played 20 minutes in Game 1, and the number probably would&rsquo;ve been closer to 25 if it had been closer. In addition to focusing on the calf muscle, the truth is Porzingis&rsquo;s cardio was limited by the injury for weeks. It&rsquo;s tough to be thrown right into a Finals game.</p>

<p>His first half was one of the best of his career, maybe the best considering the moment. Of course, if some of those shots had just happened to miss, his night would have been viewed differently.</p>

<p>He was really impactful on the back line of the defense, though. Yes, he had some blocked shots, but there were so many other plays where the Mavericks were clearly looking for a lob, and Porzingis&rsquo;s mere presence made them think twice. -Adam</p>

Some of it was the Mavs&rsquo; approach to denying him the ball; some of it was undoubtedly coming back after missing a month. The good thing for the Celtics is that, except between Games 3 and 4, there will be two days between games, which gives everyone a little extra time to recover.</p>

Dwight is a really good vet and teammate for this Mavs squad. He might not get a lot of time on the floor, but it seems like he&rsquo;s well-liked in the locker room. He&rsquo;s interactive with most of the players, and he&rsquo;s always rebounding the rainfall of makes/misses from the team&rsquo;s halfcourt shooting contests by punching the ball back to the other side of the court.</p>

It&rsquo;s hard to differentiate yourself with so much competition around, so I tend to go for stories that are a little off the beaten path.

      <label for="l7jy6pl" class="commentText"><p>I actually did that story when he was playing for the Spurs. This was back in the mid-&lsquo;90s before he&rsquo;d made friends with dictators. He really wasn&rsquo;t talking much. I went down there and waited him out for two days. He saw that I was serious, I guess, and he told me that I could go to dinner with him and his crew, which turned out to be three or four volleyball players from the local college; a family of four from Detroit; and his mechanic. He enjoyed answering the questions I was asking at dinner, so he said that he and I would go to a local bar and drop everyone else. As we&rsquo;re walking in, he turns over his shoulder and asks me, &ldquo;Ever been in a gay bar before?&rdquo; It was Dennis&rsquo; way of trying to shock you and see how you&rsquo;d react. He was an interesting guy. Extremely sensitive, but, at heart, a very kind soul. He was pretty much done by the time he got to Dallas. Not one of Cuban&rsquo;s better ideas. But that was one of my favorite stories. To this day, as far as I know, it&rsquo;s the only interview of a mainstream athlete in a gay bar.</p>

      <label for="l7jqirb" class="commentText"><p>Players move around so much, it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal. KP was only here a couple years. When Donnie Nelson swung the trade to get him, I thought it was genius. Figured a couple of Euros like Luka and KP could really make it work. We&rsquo;ve never really determined why it didn&rsquo;t. KP&rsquo;s availability didn&rsquo;t help. He&rsquo;s also said it was difficult for him to adjust to being the second option. Maybe he&rsquo;s just grown up. He certainly seems happy in Boston.</p>

      <label for="l7k2os5" class="commentText"><p>About two weeks into the season. The Celtics have been an elite team for nearly a decade but just haven&rsquo;t quite been able to take the final step.</p>

<p>But the additions of Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis were simply massive. Once it became clear that Holiday was more than willing to sacrifice and Porzingis was more than capable of fitting in alongside Tatum and Brown, this team became the obvious title favorite.</p>

      <label for="l7k33mo" class="commentText"><p>For me, it was when the Mavs beat the Thunder in 6 games. Luka played really well despite the physicality of Lu Dort, and PJ Washington and Derrick Jones were key contributors in that series. It&rsquo;s almost as if you knew Kyrie would eventually flip the switch against the Wolves. At that point, they had a lot of momentum going into the Western Conference Finals.</p>

      <label for="l7jzxjp" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not just reporters. It&rsquo;s our editors, producers, photographers, the copydesk, etc. It takes an entire staff to cover the NBA Finals. It does take an ability to be nimble and adaptable because plans can change in the blink of an eye. There&rsquo;s a lot of extra attention that comes with it as well. Podcasts, television, radio, Redditt AMAs lol. It&rsquo;s all part of the Finals experience. You have to embrace it, but make sure you keep the main thing the main thing. Make sure you&rsquo;re prepared. Prioritize your questions and stories, because that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re there in the first place. And that&rsquo;s for any game, not just the Finals. Good luck!</p>

      <label for="l7k47xk" class="commentText"><p>Both coaches spoke before and after the game. Kidd is usually calm despite the circumstances. After the game, he seemed even keeled, but he definitely kept bringing up a travel in the third quarter that seemed like the end of the Mavs&rsquo; chances to complete their comeback. Both Irving and Lively traveled within a 30-second timeframe.  That was the most interesting part of his presser.</p>

      <label for="l7k3g0t" class="commentText"><p>Highly doubt Kyrie will be that bad again. 6-19 from the field, more turnovers than assists, 0-5 from 3. If he does that again this series will be over quick. Luka obviously needs more help. Honestly, I think the Celtics played well but they&rsquo;re capable of taking it up several more notches. Tatum was so-so, Pritchard went 0-fer. 107 points is a bit low for them. -Khari</p>

Hopefully they can keep moving the ball and get some easy buckets inside because when the ball stops moving Tatum and brown are the worst offenders !! Other than that stretch  in the 3rd quarter Celtics played really well.</p>

“Are you happy to see them rise to the occasion” who rose to the occasion on the mavs?
“Kyrie you guys out scored them in the third and fourth quarter” that’s 2-2 in quarters yay! 1 point and 2 points with 6 min of garbage time
“You yourself have been apart of the greatest nba finals comeback” </p>
