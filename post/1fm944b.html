      <label for="lo9rj5f" class="commentText"><p>Tay was almost the original wingspan freak. Guys  just plain weren&rsquo;t used to somebody with arms as long as his. This is a guy who earned his starting spot by coming in as a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s throw shit at the wall and see what sticks&rdquo; idea when the Pistons were down 3-1 in the first round to the Magic, and he turned the series around by turning Tracy McGrady into a pumpkin.</p>

<p>In 2004, Tay was the 5th starter. In 2024, he&rsquo;d be making $20M a year</p>

<p>Also KG I love you, but let the man talk after you ask him a question.</p>

Prince came into the league as an offensive star from Kentucky, then was quickly one of the best defenders in the league. They were such a strange team and I absolutely loved it.</p>

The other guys maybe had a couple good games against him, but at some point Kobe dropped 50 or 60 on them, maybe even multiple times. Never Tayshaun. Maybe the best on ball defender I’ve ever seen.</p>

He was just amazing.</p>

<p>I was working that Sunday crushed under work for a project in the office. When the news came out about the crash, I probably aimlessly stared around out the window and at the news for 5 hours instead of going home. I just couldn’t process anything that day.</p>

      <label for="lobdk7b" class="commentText"><p>Kobe is an all time dribbler/footwork guy with one of the best first steps ever. Artest is one of the best defenders ever but his large size wasn&rsquo;t really a benefit against Kobe. Like Prince says Kobe was all about wearing you out over 3 quarters and then when you are gassed in  the 4th Kobe just barley hit his stride. A lighter longer defender like Prince didn&rsquo;t have the same issue as Artest who was more easily gassed by the 4th (at least when playing Kobe) and when he does get tired his absurd length helps make up for it.</p>

But compare his numbers to any scoring guard in his era it&rsquo;s right there if not better. Also if he was so bad teams would dare him to shoot jumpers all game. And no team was stupid enough to do that. Avery Bradley, Tony Allen, Raja Bell, Artest, and many others played Kobe tight af on the perimeter never sagging off</p>

<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t people realize at how stupidly intelligent LeBron is at the Pick and Roll. It is hard for a young player to be great at threading the ball through two defenders to get the roll man the ball. It only took Lebron a few months to be elite at it.</p>

<p>There is a difference when you need 25-32 minutes a night vs 35-45.</p>

<p>Embid gives you the best 25 minutes a night in the league, hands down.  he is absolutely dominant.  problem is he eventually gets tired, and in the high minute playoff games how many times has he disappeared in the 4th?  It wasn&rsquo;t all Simmons.</p>

And when 11-12 of your points are coming from the line and you’re still gassed getting calls that a lot of people would at best say are arguable of course that’s gonna draw ire. Playing dirty and throwing your hands up like that one cat meme after every drive doesn’t help. </p>

<p>The basketball game was not the same against Kobe. If you let him get to his spots, he&rsquo;s going to outscore your entire team.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t quite the same as the physical effort of chasing LeBron through screens, curry around the whole damn court, etc. There was a single moment that decided every possession. A split second, where the defense either let Kobe manipulate them to get to one of his many spots, or an all-out blitz and gamble to keep him away from it. Because once he was there, you were barbecued chicken. 99 times out of 100.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like that 20-year-old LeBron on a fast break, but Kobe had five spots, and if he got to any of them&hellip;&hellip; Ain&rsquo;t really shit you could do but pray</p>

<p>LeBron, comparatively, by the time he was reaching his peak in Cleveland, was at <sup>109</sup>&frasl;<sub>110</sub>, and getting up to 120 during his time with the Heat.   Jordan during his prime was going 110-114.  Curry was constantly in the 115+ range and broke 120 a couple of times.  Wade was slightly better than Kobe efficiency wise during his prime but has a longer sub-prime to pull his career TS+ down just under Kobe.  T-Mac was, outside a couple of years, less efficient than Kobe, but peaked higher than him.</p>

You can be a historically great player and scorer and be inefficient by today&rsquo;s standards bc you played in a different era.

<p>But there is still a lot of truth in that statement. Kobe was once asked if anybody beat him one-on-one. And his expression in response was one of disbelief. And then he says this</p>

<p>&ldquo;NO. that&rsquo;s what I DO&rdquo;.</p>

So yeah I agree it&rsquo;s the evolution of the game. Being a pure scorer is amazing to be and watch, but it&rsquo;s not gonna carry the team.</p>

<p>Ngl it would be dope to see Giannis and KD on the same team. Just had to add.</p>

Also players who are good passers usually gets most praise for basketball IQ, CP3, Rondo, Lebron… maybe because they have to map out a play before hand to get teammates the ball but I think all elite players have very high BBIQ.</p>

<p>Like I said, you’re not going to be an MVP calibre player with no BBIQ but it’s just not something that Kobe is praised for en masse. Draymond and Rondo praising him for it doesn’t change the fact that</p>

      <label for="lobcilp" class="commentText"><p>Yes the reason Kobe doesn’t get praise for his BBIQ as much is because that is usually associated for players known for passing the basketball, aka Rondo Chris Paul, Luka, Jokic, Lebron, Magic, Bird.</p>

<p>Does that mean they have better basketball IQ than players like Kobe, Jordan, Kareem, Duncan, Steph etc… I don’t think so. We can agree to disagree there. And in case you think I’m changing the topic again, Kobe has gotten plenty of praise for his basketball mind, unless you don’t associate mind with IQ.</p>

<p>He would’ve been more efficient by playing off-ball too but Derek Fisher was his Point Guard for a majority of his seasons and could not be counted on to run the offense.</p>

<p>Of course it also has to do with the triangle offense and running it in the post for his bigs that he wasn’t able to play similar to Doncic, or James Harden.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This seems silly to say. LeBron would absolutely win in 1v1 pretty frequently. Who is actually going to stop him in 1v1 in practice? Like what would Reaves actually do? Get lucky and hit some 3s in a row and maybe pull out a win on make it take it? Once LeBron has the ball, how is Reaves going to actually stop LeBron if he&rsquo;s taking it seriously and not goofing around? It&rsquo;d just be straight bully ball.</p>

<p>He just doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good use of his practice time because the game of 1v1 is really not very applicable to NBA basketball. Don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s actually an unreasonable take. LeBron already talked about this on the JJ Redick podcast back 5 months ago. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3zwDF1wM_DE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3zwDF1wM_DE</a></p>

<p>Cuz he has a higher career TS%, eFG%, 3P%, FG%, 2P%</p>

<p>He also has better efficiency in clutch moments despite what people believe.</p>

<p>Sure, no problem.  Here is each player&rsquo;s career league adjusted FG add:</p>

<p>Kobe:  -298.7<br>
LeBron:  +2417.2</p>

<p>Were those the numbers you were referring to?</p>

      <label for="loafsrl" class="commentText"><p>Neither of them were <em>great</em> shooters from game-to-game, but the data doesn’t lie.</p>

<p>Kobe was the best tough-shot maker ever, and seemed like he couldn’t miss if he got to his spots, but he also chucked quite a bit, especially in his later years.</p>

<p>Bron has just been steadily improving his outside shooting since he came into the league and the numbers reflect that.</p>
