He looks gangly and awkward when he moves,  and there&rsquo;s no better example of that than when he&rsquo;s on an island trying to stay in front of guards on the perimeter. He&rsquo;s the antithesis of the &ldquo;hooper&rdquo; archetype players put so much stock in.</p>

<p>To casuals he doesn’t really look like he’s doing much to win you games, he more looks like he’s helping you not lose.</p>

<p>So anytime they lose it’s his fault and he didn’t do his job, despite KAT playing horrendously, ant being unable to playmake at all, and the Dallas offense slowing to below average when he was on the court and being an all time great offense when he was off.</p>

<p>Rudy did his job that series, but people are gonna keep saying this shit until he posters someone for the game winner in the finals.</p>

<p>Like Kyrie vs Gobert is probably as big of a skill gap as there is. If I’m just trying to win I would rather pay Gobert a <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times.</p>

No reason to bulk up as much as the paint has fewer players and no 90&rsquo;s big man guarding him. I&rsquo;m sure he would be much more reasonable on the perimeter with training.

      <label for="llmvc3n" class="commentText"><p>The real joke is that nobody thinks Shaq would have to change at all for the modern era.</p>

<p>Everyone bringing up Shaq in 2024 says the same horseshit - “he was so dominant, it doesn’t matter that he’s 2000s era slow on the court. He would just BEAT EVERYONE UP, PUT EM IN THE HOSPITAL, 5V1, he’d score FIFTY a game and force every team to waive all their shooters and athletes and sign 7 zaza pachulias each. Trae young? He’d put him in the GRAVE before allowing him to get one three off”</p>

<p>Shaq even says Gobert is a bum cuz he gets blown up on switches to an unplayable level? Whether that’s true or not, you guys think 400lb Shaq would be okay today chasing Steph and dame off the screen? Trying to catch up to a KD pindown? And I’m not even gonna get into how much modern double teams make pure post scorers struggle - if I point to embiid, who is undoubtedly one of the most skilled post players EVER, yall will say “Shaq ain’t a choker like him” like that means something. Note that everyone who goes post up heavy past the conference finals is not just a GREAT passer (like Shaq) but a straight up ELITE floor general (lebron, Luka, jokic)</p>

<p>At the very least, Shaq would have to stay Orlando weight his entire career. And IMO even then his defense would be more of a problem today than in 1999</p>

<p>Edit - copied from another comment I put:</p>

<p>I feel like everyone misunderstanding me</p>

<p>2024 Shaq that puts up 32-12-5 on 58% shooting, MVP level contributions that may or may not win the actual trophy, a chance at a ring or even dynasty if you can put the right players around him - I 100000% agree, he’s a beast and a legend</p>

<p>2024 Shaq that puts up 45-15-0 on 78% shooting, injures half the league, fucks Chet holmgrens wife, makes Trae young and Steph stop shooting from half court, wins 8 rings in a row and declared “most alpha ever” - no lmfao it’s not happening</p>

<p>Nah, no one says that, but you have two extremes, saying that Shaq from Magic couldn&rsquo;t play today. On the other hand, there was a thread just before where the dude wrote that 00s Shaq was faster than Jokić and Embiid.  I got downvoted and called a nephew for posting few lowlights like this one.</p>

<p>He would not curbstomp and make these people weep. It would be as close and as determined by role players as the rest of those guys</p>

      <label for="llny5c4" class="commentText"><p>The Giannis wall is probably the closest thing to guard Shaq on the other end. First off Shaq will definitely NOT be the same weight, he’ll be Orlando weight or honestly less than that. Second they’re gonna put a nominally “small” defender on him (6 8 to 6 10) to harass and deny the ball and then the 7 footer will lurk the paint daring him to take a shot outside the circle, and every player will crash on him and force him to kick it out by swiping down at the ball</p>

<p>Can someone give me a legit basketball reason why that wouldn’t atleast frustrate Shaq? I’ve seen full playoff games of Shaq and the amount of time he gets to do a solo post up backdown would make embiid cry tears of joy.</p>

      <label for="llof8rc" class="commentText"><p>Not agility so much as stamina.  Dude just couldn&rsquo;t run 40 minutes both sides as a 350lb man without getting gassed.  He could do it for a single play or small stretches, but it would take a lot of energy out of him, and it just isn&rsquo;t worth it as his gravity is by far strongest in the paint (on both sides).  Shaq would be a drop center just like Jojo, Joker, Rudy or any other full time center today.  Those guys do not switch unless forced, because their value is in the paint.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people around here claiming Shaq was a terrible overall defender before.  That is not remotely true.  Shaq was an absolute beast inside and guys were scared to take it to the hole against him, not only for the threat of blocks (which is high), but because he had no problems hard fouling if you beat him and Shaq is liable to injure dudes with hard fouls because of his strength.  Your ass is bruised at a minimum if you try to dunk on Shaq.  And his stories of punishing post players with his elbows/forearms is legendary.  Guys would just straight up not even try to post Shaq up as their back would hurt for a week afterwards.</p>

<p>But yeah he was below average, especially for a star center, on the perimeter.  But coaches knew it and just know that&rsquo;s a limitation of a big guy like him.</p>

      <label for="llnobdd" class="commentText"><p>True, especially in this part of his career. This is my hot take on Shaq, is that his in-contention-for-GOAT peak ends at 2000. He put on weight after, and his defense suffered a ton.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stack.com/a/remember-when-shaq-was-ripped-and-super-athletic-heres-how-he-put-on-so-much-weight/" target="_blank">https://www.stack.com/a/remember-when-shaq-was-ripped-and-super-athletic-heres-how-he-put-on-so-much-weight/</a></p>

<p>His offense was incredible for basically a decade from his 2nd season on, but I think his defense and offense really only comes together in 2000, and the 2001 playoffs(which are obviously incredible and huge to his legacy, but it&rsquo;s weird to think of a &ldquo;peak&rdquo; season as one where you mail in defense in the regular season). If you look at how many role players who seem like positive defenders are on the roster, and then see that from &lsquo;00 to &lsquo;01 they go from the best defense in the league to the 21st, it&rsquo;s kinda stark. &lsquo;02-&lsquo;04 they have better regular seasons but in the playoffs they&rsquo;re middle of the pack. Obviously he&rsquo;s not the only input, Kobe was famous for his defensive effort going down with offensive responsibility, and they have aging and changing role players, but he&rsquo;s an anchor and we get some really mixed signals alongside his weight gain. And impact metrics, which I don&rsquo;t love citing because they&rsquo;re imperfect, seem to show that pattern too.</p>

<p>He then goes to Miami, loses weight, takes on less offensive responsibility, has some new motivation, and Miami&rsquo;s defense stays elite in the playoffs in 05 and 06. It&rsquo;s hard to assess defensive roster strength + coaching, but Jackson is a famously great defensive coach(so is Riley, Riley more so but Phil&rsquo;s great) and I&rsquo;m not really convinced those Heat lineups have more defensive talent. At least not enough for the difference to not be somewhat attributable to Shaq.</p>

<p>Anyways way too long a comment, I could be convinced that his rim defense just stays so incredible it doesn&rsquo;t matter off good video analysis, but this video is kinda who I think Shaq was in this period defensively, immobile and inflexible to the tune of diminished impact</p>

He was still a strong interior defender when it mattered, but yeah his perimeter stuff is real bad thanks to the weight that helped him dominate on the offensive end. I would still keep him up there for that alone.</p>

      <label for="llo1fb5" class="commentText"><p>I totally get that. My soft stance is something like, he was less consistent but when he had slightly undersized centers defending him, or not enough fouls to throw at him, you could just pencil him in for ridiculous numbers. Biggest matchup nightmare in history. IDK if that outweighs the crazy impact the other guys you mentioned have, a hard to quantify element is that perimeter players have the ball more and make more decisions, while interior players have defenses that are schemed around them more/get involved in more plays. IDK, regardless I think you&rsquo;re fair lol</p>

Meaning every team today has a player who can do what Nash did to Shaq. Shaq would still be a great player in today&rsquo;s NBA, but he doesn&rsquo;t become an all time top 10 player if he started his career today. It&rsquo;s just the nature of the modern game - like how Luka embarrassed the reigning DPOY Gobert.</p>

      <label for="llmct0l" class="commentText"><p>The weirdest part to me is, usually Gobert goes to bench because his offensive game is limited. He cant punish small guys with his back to basket game. So crowded lane plus his footspeed on the perimeter hurts the team even more. If he was even Dwight Howard level on the post, his defense would not be ridiculed as much.</p>

      <label for="llmzas7" class="commentText"><p>That was also one of the reasons they lost that game against the Clippers. Yes the perimeter defense was horrid so they couldn’t take Rudy out. But his offense is such a black hole his teammates aren’t comfortable giving him the ball on the block and he couldn’t even take advantage of a small Clippers lineup. </p>

      <label for="llnptye" class="commentText"><p>*Don Nelson never prioritized defense.</p>

<p>Neither of them were huge negatives on defense. It&rsquo;s just that the team was constructed in such a way where someone good enough to start and be a good defender (like Adrian Griffin for example) has other glaring weaknesses - he&rsquo;s too small as a 3.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also Raja Bell who was a good defender too, but at that point in time he doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of shots, so he can&rsquo;t really be an outlet for Dirk, or another scoring option for Nash if Dirk/Finley is on the bench.</p>

<p>one of their two Thinking Basketball profiles go into it. Basically, for the fact that you had two all-time offensive players, their offense wasn&rsquo;t gamebreaking. After they parted ways, they played on offenses that were as good, or even better. I don&rsquo;t think the system effectively used both of them to their fullest capacity.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like how the Heatles were actually better with Wade sitting.</p>

      <label for="lloiiua" class="commentText"><p>They were NOT better with Wade sitting, his defensive value made up for spacing issues. It did make sense to stagger him and Bron though, to make sure you always had at least one on the floor, and that&rsquo;s reflected in LeBron&rsquo;s +/-, which was a shadow of what it was in Cleveland, both before and after.</p>

<p>I also think LeBron is a fit nightmare for MOST stars, and it&rsquo;s my big knock against him. Goes from a lone star to the Heatles, and his volume stayed the same, his efficiency stayed the same, his assists stayed the same, his USG% stayed the same, his % of FG&rsquo;s assisted stayed the same. It&rsquo;s absolutely fucking crazy that his roster changed THAT much, yet his numbers just did not change, and that&rsquo;s a serious double edged sword.</p>

Pretty sure Don Nelson gave Nash the ultimate green light. That&rsquo;s why Cuban was rightfully mocked for giving up on Nash and signing Erick Dampier to improve the team&rsquo;s defense.</p>

The crux of the cross era debate is if you can defend Shaq and play him off the floor when literally nobody can guard him 1 on 1. The thing with Shaq was he was not unskilled. He’s an all time great for a reason. If he has it going there was NOTHING legit great bigs or defenses could do with him. He’d just power through doubles like the defenders were real life Fatheads.</p>

I’m not going to defend Shaq like I know him but he’s kinda just always been a hater like that in between being the fun guy we remember. Kobe said it in that PBD interview. He’s petty, vindictive, mean and competitive as hell. Shaq is just not ever going to respect a center that’s not on his level. It is what it is at this point.</p>

<p>But i was just saying I’m old enough to remember Shaq was notoriously bad on switches and the league knew it then.  It just didn’t matter because he made up for it.</p>

      <label for="llmw3c8" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the Gobert slander, but this is meaningless argument. Shaq wasn&rsquo;t an all pro, MVP level because of his defense. He did deter people from coming in the paint, but his biggest strength was dominating offensively.</p>

<p>People are truly mad because Gobert got paid a big contract for being an elite role player. If Green and Gobert changed places, no one would criticize Gobert because he would be consider a perfect piece for the warriors (assuming they still win 3x). Green would be ostracized for being a blackhole on offense without Curry there to make up for it.</p>

<p>To be clear, I don&rsquo;t think Gobert is a better fit than Green, I&rsquo;m hypothetically saying if they swapped careers with same abilities.</p>

      <label for="lloae24" class="commentText"><p>People who believe that Shaq would dominate in the modern game vastly underrate two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Being put in the pick and roll on every defensive possession would be extremely tough on him and also sap his energy on the offensive side. Elite guards would absolutely feast on him today.</li>
<li>Average TS in the NBA is currently 58%. During the Lakers&rsquo; 3-peat it was about 52%. Shaq was a career 52.7% FT shooter. Halfcourt possessions are a bit less efficient than the average possession, but the Hack-A-Shaq today would be far more harmful to his impact than it was during his prime.</li>

      <label for="llohe3o" class="commentText"><p>Shaq is the beneficiary of his era, he played in the slowest era of all time that favored his style of play. Yes, he&rsquo;d still be good, if not great today, especially if he actually stayed in Orlando shape instead of sacrificing mobility for power (or just wasn&rsquo;t a lazy fatass), but he wouldn&rsquo;t be as good. No jumper, doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s unplayable, but it&rsquo;s a factor that didn&rsquo;t matter in his era. Weak perimeter defense, his rim protection wasn&rsquo;t as good as he believes either, but what you see here would be 10x worse with space and pace. 2000s Shaq was also a transition liability, you didn&rsquo;t even see him make it back most of the time, and that would be 10x worse today if he didn&rsquo;t get his ass in shape.</p>

<p>His half-court offense would make up for it, he&rsquo;d be just as good now as he was 20 years ago, but the cost for his weaknesses would be far greater than it was in the past.</p>
