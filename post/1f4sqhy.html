<p>I feel like there used to be more spirited debates between the quality one of one gen of basketball vs. another, too.  People could easily cite the footage.</p>

<p>Now all debates are permeated with an anti-plumber, anti-&ldquo;shot on a potato&rdquo; bias like nothing pre-2012 is relevant.</p>

<p>Not sure what you are trying to say here. If this is taken directly from film, then it certainly could be 4k &ndash; quality film usually has better resolution than 4k.</p>

      <label for="lkpfa1f" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;d be shocked. I remember one time, when I visited the Secaucus office where all the video stuff is, I asked if they had like the videos of old games and the responses varied from &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, that&rsquo;s maybe a broadcasting thing&rdquo; (which is almost certainly wrong) to &ldquo;it&rsquo;s somewhere in this building scattered somewhere and no one knows where they are&rdquo;. The NBA is extremely disorganized. To the point where, even working in data, no one knew where the stats for the <a href="http://nba.com/stats" target="_blank">nba.com/stats</a> were stored. There was some process where it was computed (maybe by genius sports?) and put through some nba process and uploaded to the site and no one was actually capturing the stats for internal use. I&rsquo;m sure the videos are somewhere, but it&rsquo;s not a vault. It&rsquo;s probably in some drawer with a stapler and sticky notes.</p>

      <label for="lkqmp72" class="commentText"><p>FWIW, dantheman (the guy who runs the Wilt Chamberlain Archive on YT) said this on a post over at /r/VintageNBA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have inside sources that confirm they have WAY more than they let on. Which goes against what I had believed for years as an avid private collector. Years ago I also thought they released what they had and it all ‘wasn’t much’. And it probably does get fragmented and more incomplete the further back you go especially when broadcasts were only local affairs in the 1960s but by the late 60s and early 70s for example I know they have entire Wilt vs Jabbar playoff series like 1971, in broadcast form, and the basketball world would love to see it. So why don’t we? It’s probably due to two things …the biggest being multiple hands caught in the copyright jar. NBA did not have exclusive rights back then (networks that still exist as companies today did) and it would be a huge expensive mess to ever even attempt to co-manage it to provide these games to viewers so why bother at all. The second is, they market for todays audience and a lot of the old stuff is probably a subsidy at best in the eyes of the money making machine especially due to the aforementioned legal issues to bring all that stuff forward. The nba owned their full broadcast rights sometime in the 1980s which is why it’s no coincidence their fans can see those games replayed with no issues but very few games or series from the 70s or earlier.</p>

<p>There is another regular over there (saltcitycager) who is historian focusing on the Syracuse Nationals. He has done a lot of research and cataloguing of photos, film, memorabilia, etc. from the 50s and he has talked about how the NBA will buy up such material to stick in their vault:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back in the mid 50&rsquo;s, newspapers made a big deal about televised games. Each team may have been on TV about 10 times a season. Those reels are very tough to find and seldom seen on the internet. If the NBA finds them, they quickly attempt to buy them up and they get stored in a vault. I know of a few earlier photographers that sold pics from the early days that have never seen the light of day after they were sold to the NBA.</p>

<p>And in that same post, in a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/s790ds/is_there_a_place_to_find_a_directory_of_nba_game/htfq6ht/" target="_blank">different comment</a>, he elaborates on the &ldquo;sold pics&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I met a guy from Syracuse who bought a collection of photos from a widow who didn&rsquo;t know what she had. She downsized due to age and sold them extremely cheap. The purchaser approached the NBA and they were extremely interested. He got cash, an expense paid trip to Dallas for all-star weekend, and was granted a pass to all the events and locker rooms. All for this 200 photo collection.</p>

      <label for="lkr7gkb" class="commentText"><p>To be clear, I was a data scientist at the NBA for 3 years and at some point started working on computer vision stuff there. So I went to secaucus to get access to the drives where I could pull videos of plays because the data engineering + IT side is mainly there. Now, that&rsquo;s a far cry away from looking for this archival footage but when I was there, I asked like 7 different people of varying levels where I could find these old games/if they have them. Now, they could&rsquo;ve been lying to me, which is a fair point. Now, maybe they do buy this shit up, and I do think they have the footage. But whenever they end up acquiring, I think it goes into some random room that is just dependent on when it got bought and who it was given to. It&rsquo;s not such a &ldquo;structured&rdquo; vault. More a metaphorical one. That&rsquo;s not to say anything I&rsquo;m saying here strictly disagrees with what you are saying. But I want to make it clear, even if all of what you are saying is true, it&rsquo;s not maintained in any proper way. It&rsquo;s just some underpaid (by tech standards) yahoos chilling in an office shared with scholastic working for the weekend.</p>

<p>There was a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article from 2021 that reported there was a literal vault, located in a bunker that was built to withstand a nuclear blast - <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/ri034k/wall_street_journal_nba_history_lives_in_a/" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal: NBA History Lives in a Nuclear Bunker in New Jersey</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the people you talked to were not at all involved in the vault project? The article notes that the actual handling of the archive and the maintenance of the vault is done by a private company, <a href="https://vitalrecords.com/" target="_blank">Vital Records, Inc.</a> The WSJ article has quotes from Paul Hirschheimer, the league’s senior vice president of content production, FWIW.</p>

<p>This sounds incredibly awesome. Can you share any stories? What sort of statistical data did you have access to?</p>

      <label for="lkrckzj" class="commentText"><p>You know, the NBA contracting it out to a private company with proper infrastructure and talent completely checks out. Probably why people didn&rsquo;t know about it when I asked. They do indeed have a ton of film and footage in secaucus as well, my guess is the people I was talking to were just talking about what they had in that office.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say what I did and a lot of specifics, I&rsquo;d rather dm though to not dox myself hahaha. Not to say anyone would even really care about looking me up, and I bet someone could find out who I am by going through my profile. But all the same.</p>

      <label for="lkphfb1" class="commentText"><p>Not surprised at their response. There&rsquo;s no incentive to improve or actually put in work to organize because NBA already is making so much money, which I find very ironic because if they set up a streaming service like netflix but for games, they would easily make hundreds of millions more, if not billions.</p>

<p>The ones at the top of the NBA are old boomers that struggle to open emails, so naturally this is the last thing on their mind as they operate the old school way, though you can apply that to many other industries and sports.</p>

<p>The NFL, on the other hand, has been amazing with embracing tech. I love their youtube channels, so many great stuff and you can see they put a lot of thought and work in it instead of locking it all away and spamming cease and desist to anybody that tries to upload games.</p>

<p>My conspiracy theory: NBA&rsquo;s tech department are old nepo hires and their higher ups own the tech currently used, they don&rsquo;t want to let new people in or change anything because they would lose their exclusive cash cow that the NBA contractually pays them.</p>

<p>NBA is just leaving money on the table.  When everyone was watching &lsquo;The Last Dance&rsquo; I refuse to believe there&rsquo;d be no cash in giving people the option to stream some complete MJ seasons.</p>

<p>Again, look at the WWE.  Vince McMahon somehow found a way to preserve his footage so we can watch 80s Andre the Giant matches in 1080p now.  NBA could do the same, they just don&rsquo;t care.</p>

      <label for="lkr7vpj" class="commentText"><p>I worked as a data scientist at the NBA for 3 years. The tech team isn&rsquo;t even really a thing. Each department has a tech team and the departments are extremely compartmentalized. There&rsquo;s little actual interest in cutting edge tech and there is not a lot of high end talent because of low pay. I will say, from my experience, no one was a nepo hire. But again, it&rsquo;s not all that well paying. It didn&rsquo;t bother me. I loved my job. Had full independence to do computer vision + bayesian statistical analysis research using basketball stats. But at some point, no stakes becomes kinda boring.</p>

<p>ETA: You are right about the people at the top of the NBA. Basically a bunch of old white dudes that fail upwards. The NBA is a particularly old fashioned company, but yes, you can apply it to most industries.</p>
