I think they&rsquo;re both trying to be professionals in a media setting when anything either of them say can be taken out of context and ran with. They&rsquo;re both being careful with how they phrase things, which ends up in a lot of awkward pauses and thinking.</p>

<p>Cuban wouldn&rsquo;t be on the show, nor would JB have invited him, if either of them were still really butt hurt. They both know it&rsquo;s a business, and they were both trying to do what&rsquo;s best for them. That&rsquo;s just how it goes sometimes.</p>

<p>It also seems like JB was not directly involved and was not told about some of the conversations with the Mavs. And it defnitely is clear that Mark was frustrated with the lack of communication from Brunson&rsquo;s camp.</p>

<p>Overall, Mark&rsquo;s frustration over how it was handled from the Brunson side is very clear, and Brunson didn&rsquo;t do a lot to discount the reasons for that.</p>

<p>As if he wouldn&rsquo;t know that beforehand lol. Leon Rose is literally his godfather and his dad&rsquo;s former agent. His current agent is Leon Rose&rsquo;s son. JB didn&rsquo;t just find out during free agency</p>

<p>This makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p>Rick Brunson played for nine NBA teams in eight season in the league. He never had any control over his career.</p>

<p>So while he definitely did shady PR shit during Brunson&rsquo;s last year at Dallas&hellip;I can begrudge him some shady shit on behalf of getting his son to a place where he clearly enjoys playing so much and has so much more control over his career.</p>

      <label for="lkm544n" class="commentText"><p>IMO, I don&rsquo;t think Dallas lost Brunson in free agency.  They lost him in the past 3 times when they could have signed him before free agency.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The part of clowning on Dallas was, imo, about how they could have signed him cheap a year before free agency for a lot less, but would always counter with LESS than what brnson wanted (which was already little).  Then at mid-season they again offered less than what brunson wanted (which again, was less than he was worth).  Plus they also had him a trade chip &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Once free agency rolled around, Brunson was already thinking NY.  And Cuban pretty much says here that they never offered cause they wanted &ldquo;a feel&rdquo;.  Brunson stayed there waiting for an offer or convo but didn&rsquo;t get one.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Pretty much, both sides waiting for the other.  Dallas didn&rsquo;t want to offer too much (cuban mentions offering the max) and wanted to wait until Brunson put up an offer like he had done before (don&rsquo;t remember the numbers.  Like he wanted 36 million but dallas only offered in the <span class="math inline">\(20's and then in midseason Brunson wanted \)</span>64 but dallas offered around <span class="math inline">\(48 or \)</span>56).  Dallas expected Brunson to say, &ldquo;hey, I want 100 million&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lkmcxa4" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t remember anymore but they could have had him for a 14 to 16 million a year before he ever reached free agency. The big issue is that they gave him an initial rookie contract where he took a little less money than he could have in order to avoid restricted free agency.  The Mavs were always thinking they would be players for free agents so they were thinking that would be beneficial to clear up a few hundred thousand dollars on the cap. Because of that they had no way to keep Brunson.  This would have all been a moot point if they had given him a standard contract when they drafted him.</p>

      <label for="lkmf5t8" class="commentText"><p>2nd rounders don&rsquo;t have a standard contract. It could range from not being signed at all, two-way, to multi year non-guaranteed.</p>

<p>Dallas (Donnie) signed Brunson to a 4 year deal which would exclude Brunson from the Gilbert Arenas provision (He also gave Tyrell Terry the exact same contract 2 years later). Why? Well outside of drafting Luka and Brunson, Donnie had been a terrible GM at that point in time leading up to his &ldquo;discharge&rdquo;.</p>

<p>2019 free agency Dallas had 30M+ in free cap space and didn&rsquo;t spend any of it. That was Donnie&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>The agent who happends to be Leon Rose&rsquo;s the Knicks GM son.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t really buy it though. Brunson&rsquo;s dad goes to the Knicks, Knicks make numerous salary cap moves moving picks to create space, Leon Rose is his godfather, his agent is Leon Rose&rsquo;s son, his dad&rsquo;s former agent is Leon Rose, he grew up as a Knicks fan.</p>

<p>Brunson and Knicks were committed to eachother, there&rsquo;s a reason they got fined for tampering lol. But they can&rsquo;t come out and just admit it lol.</p>

The simple fact that Kyrie is so much older than Brunson means the Mavs like a 2-year window to compete before Kyrie probably can&rsquo;t be a legit #2 anymore, something that wouldn&rsquo;t have been an issue if Brunson hadn&rsquo;t tampered his way to NY.</p>

<p>I really couldn&rsquo;t care less about whether Brunson is a good guy or not. I&rsquo;m a fan of my team, not some dudes. Crazy in the modern world of NBA fans, I know.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s just poor management of the situation from their end. If you&rsquo;re going to go out publicly after the playoff series and talk about how you can give him the most money, then you shouldn&rsquo;t be relying on Brunson&rsquo;s team to tell you how much they&rsquo;re looking for. If you want to publicly talk about how you can pay the most money, and you want to keep the player, then it&rsquo;s on you to make that more expensive offer that you talked about making.  The agent isn&rsquo;t giving you a number because he wants you to make your best offer, and you bragged to the media already about what that best offer should be.</p>

<p>In fact, that offer should have been made clear before Brunson ever got to meet with the Knicks. </p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t require the agent getting back to you. It shouldn&rsquo;t require any negotiation. The mistake the Mavs made is, like Cuban said, thinking they had home court advantage. But the actual home court advantage they had was the ability to pay him more, and they shouldn&rsquo;t have required prodding to do that. </p>

<li><p>I wish they had Josh’s face shown on a small corner for the entire exchange.</p></li>

<li><p>The Isaiah Hartenstein situation where he left was in no way similar to JB leaving to go to the Knicks. Knicks had the cap space to worry about and could not pay him more than the Thunder, while Mavs still could have offered JB more money.</p></li>
