      <label for="lknrgyi" class="commentText"><p>Especially since it has sort of worked out for both? Dallas had a great season last year, and Jalen is an All-NBA player on a now-competitive Knicks team. If the Mavs stunk last year, this interview probably doesn&rsquo;t happen, but I think having the conversation publicly is a good (albeit awkward at times) look for both sides, and hearing inside stuff like this is the whole point of athlete podcasts IMO.</p>

<p>They both also probably see the benefit of telling their sides of the story directly, rather than having reporters tell half-truths or just speculate.</p>

<p>Rick Brunson was not some hot candidate that every team was gunning to hire. He had been out of NBA coaching for several years with his last stint ending 6 years prior due to misconduct allegations. Knowing this it&rsquo;s easy to see why someone like Mark Cuban would believe the hire heavily influenced or fully determined where JB was going.</p>

I think they&rsquo;re both trying to be professionals in a media setting when anything either of them say can be taken out of context and ran with. They&rsquo;re both being careful with how they phrase things, which ends up in a lot of awkward pauses and thinking.</p>

<p>Cuban wouldn&rsquo;t be on the show, nor would JB have invited him, if either of them were still really butt hurt. They both know it&rsquo;s a business, and they were both trying to do what&rsquo;s best for them. That&rsquo;s just how it goes sometimes.</p>

I’m sure Dallas thinks they mostly did the wrong things for the right reason — I.e., they thought he was good, but they had no idea he would be THIS good. And they acted accordingly. I actually think most executives
 would’ve or could’ve done something similar in the same situation.</p>

I’m sure they had some decent feelers out there, but I’m still sure they woulda rather kept their own 24 year old (who has a sterling reputation/work ethic/personality) than bank on maybe getting the 31 year old who, um, doesn’t have that reputation at all.</p>

<p>I know we all love Kyrie and he had some great playoff moments but it was pretty clear all post-season there’s a pretty clear gap between him and Brunson at this point. He simply can’t shoulder that big of a load.</p>

<p>They’re continued success is mostly because Luka often plays near GOAT-tier caliber. If they had Brunson, a guy who can literally bag 40 in any given playoff game, they’d be a lot better than what they have now. They might have a ring by now. And would be much better set up for the future.</p>

They might be better off with Brunson, but who knows what other moves they make if they paid him. There are very few teams in the league who would trade rosters with the Mavs right now.</p>

<p>If you’re a Mavs fan who isn’t happy with your current position as a franchise, you’re just a hater who won’t ever be satisfied.</p>

<p>The agent who happends to be Leon Rose&rsquo;s the Knicks GM son.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t really buy it though. Brunson&rsquo;s dad goes to the Knicks, Knicks make numerous salary cap moves moving picks to create space, Leon Rose is his godfather, his agent is Leon Rose&rsquo;s son, his dad&rsquo;s former agent is Leon Rose, he grew up as a Knicks fan.</p>

<p>Brunson and Knicks were committed to eachother, there&rsquo;s a reason they got fined for tampering lol. But they can&rsquo;t come out and just admit it lol.</p>

<p>Leave it to an attention privileged fanbase like the Knicks to not have any clue how exposure and engagement works. Never have to worry about that when your team already gets incessant attention no matter how good or bad they are.</p>

<p>Like common.. I really don&rsquo;t think Jalen or Mark didn&rsquo;t get along well. I also think the Mavs wanted to keep him for a certain $ amount, but you can clearly hear out of Mark&rsquo;s mouth that the agent really didn&rsquo;t want the Mavs on the table to negotiate. Mark doesn&rsquo;t say that the agent played dirty directly but Jalen should know better why he didn&rsquo;t hear anything back from the Mavs :) because the Agent didn&rsquo;t want him to.</p>

<p>Just my personal view on things here &hellip; I still believe it&rsquo;s better for both parties because the Mavs couldn&rsquo;t have given Jalen the role he deserved (Luka stays #1) and Jalen is maybe not the best player next to Luka if you got Kyrie.</p>

<p>But this is a great example how agents/family members whoever influence this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Overall, Mark&rsquo;s frustration over how it was handled from the Brunson side is very clear, and Brunson didn&rsquo;t do a lot to discount the reasons for that.</p>

<p>This makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p>Rick Brunson played for nine NBA teams in eight season in the league. He never had any control over his career.</p>

<p>So while he definitely did shady PR shit during Brunson&rsquo;s last year at Dallas&hellip;I can begrudge him some shady shit on behalf of getting his son to a place where he clearly enjoys playing so much and has so much more control over his career.</p>

      <label for="lkm544n" class="commentText"><p>IMO, I don&rsquo;t think Dallas lost Brunson in free agency.  They lost him in the past 3 times when they could have signed him before free agency.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The part of clowning on Dallas was, imo, about how they could have signed him cheap a year before free agency for a lot less, but would always counter with LESS than what brnson wanted (which was already little).  Then at mid-season they again offered less than what brunson wanted (which again, was less than he was worth).  Plus they also had him a trade chip &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Once free agency rolled around, Brunson was already thinking NY.  And Cuban pretty much says here that they never offered cause they wanted &ldquo;a feel&rdquo;.  Brunson stayed there waiting for an offer or convo but didn&rsquo;t get one.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Pretty much, both sides waiting for the other.  Dallas didn&rsquo;t want to offer too much (cuban mentions offering the max) and wanted to wait until Brunson put up an offer like he had done before (don&rsquo;t remember the numbers.  Like he wanted 36 million but dallas only offered in the <span class="math inline">\(20's and then in midseason Brunson wanted \)</span>64 but dallas offered around <span class="math inline">\(48 or \)</span>56).  Dallas expected Brunson to say, &ldquo;hey, I want 100 million&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lkmcxa4" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t remember anymore but they could have had him for a 14 to 16 million a year before he ever reached free agency. The big issue is that they gave him an initial rookie contract where he took a little less money than he could have in order to avoid restricted free agency.  The Mavs were always thinking they would be players for free agents so they were thinking that would be beneficial to clear up a few hundred thousand dollars on the cap. Because of that they had no way to keep Brunson.  This would have all been a moot point if they had given him a standard contract when they drafted him.</p>

<p>Dallas (Donnie) signed Brunson to a 4 year deal which would exclude Brunson from the Gilbert Arenas provision (He also gave Tyrell Terry the exact same contract 2 years later). Why? Well outside of drafting Luka and Brunson, Donnie had been a terrible GM at that point in time leading up to his &ldquo;discharge&rdquo;.</p>

<p>2019 free agency Dallas had 30M+ in free cap space and didn&rsquo;t spend any of it. That was Donnie&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why the Mavs tried shopping JB in January (this was when the team was trying to salvage something from WCS - he just got outright waived instead), then tried again at the trade deadline. His father then said that JB was &ldquo;disrespected&rdquo; by being offered up for a trade.</p>

Seems overall pretty fair though, it&rsquo;s a much more complex situation than a lot of reddit hot takes gave it credit for and I don&rsquo;t think anyone was objectively &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; but I do think that people that blame Dallas fully for that offseason are a bit off base</p>

I&rsquo;d agree if Brunson came out and said he wanted NYK over anything, but he didn&rsquo;t. So either he&rsquo;s still lying about entertaining other offers, or his agent wasn&rsquo;t actually doing his job of maximizing his clients contract.</p>

If I were an NBA player and found out my agent wasn&rsquo;t passing along information or offers from any team that I was considering signing with, I&rsquo;d be absolutely furious and fire that fucker on the spot.</p>

      <label for="lkmowsq" class="commentText"><p>My take on this negotiation is Mark Cuban fumbled it badly. He was trying to get the number offered by the other team so he can negotiate a slightly better offer. He didn&rsquo;t make any offer. He just wanted the least amount to offer Jalen Brunson, just enough to keep him. And he didn&rsquo;t want to extend him when he could, start of the season and all-star break, and that&rsquo;s why he lost on this deal.</p>

<p>Any counter offer that is just same contract + 1 is a bad deal. And since the Mavs didn&rsquo;t  give any number, Brunson&rsquo;s agent made a good move staying silent and just listening to the most amount he can get for his client. He&rsquo;s not obliged to give any number and present any offer that has no number attached to it.</p>

      <label for="lknx409" class="commentText"><p>Nah, Cuban lowballed him during the season and used negotiating tactics after the season ended. He said in the interview he realized at the end only the max would do. Why didn’t he realize that sooner and make it clear to Brunson’s camp he’d offer the max as soon as free agency opened? Cuban has a history of lowballing free agents and it costing him. Nash is the biggest example but there a few others. Even though they made the final last year not paying Brunson was a big mistake as it made the Mavs to give up significant assets to get Kyrie, which they could’ve used instead to round out a team lead by Luka and Jalen.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t want to pay Jalen Brunson a max deal? Brunson took less than the Max with New York and people said it was an overpay. Brunson even mentions his dad working for New York as a factor in his decision, I think it was obvious to Cuban that Dallas would have to significantly outbid New York to re-sign him, and that was a price that they weren&rsquo;t willing to pay.</p>

<p>As Cuban said, they submitted an offer, then kept asking Brunson&rsquo;s agent for a salary range for the next offer. I fully believe that, I also believe that the salary range would have been in the 30 million range, and I believe that Cuban and the Mavs would have declined.</p>

<p>The Mavs never had a realistic chance to get Brunson for a price they were willing to pay. Brunson could have maybe got a little more money, but he wanted to play in New York, so everyone got what they wanted. Nobody fumbled anything.</p>

      <label for="lkqi5dl" class="commentText"><p>Of course the Mavs fumbled. If Jalen didn’t accept their first offer then they should’ve traded him at the deadline. You don’t let an asset in his prime walk for nothing unless you’re a serious title contender. Mavs only have themselves to blame not making him a bigger offer prior to the deadline and then allowing him to consider other opportunities going into free agency. Worse case scenario they could’ve overpaid him during the season and then traded him if it didn’t work out as planned. Mavs also should’ve considered that with the cap increasing and a new CBA, overpaying Jalen would’ve been fair value at worst after a couple of years.</p>

      <label for="lkmrsfo" class="commentText"><p>Interesting but awkward especially over the mics and not in person.
I think what everyone here is saying makes sense. The gms son, his dad, shit was happening.</p>

<p>They start by saying after we lose game 5.
Wasn’t there a longer saga to this? Like Brunson wanted to stay was ready to sign a deal but it didn’t get done. They said revisit after the season?  I don’t really remember, trying to understand.</p>

<p>The agent could easily value Knicks contract plus endorsements equal to Mavs max plus endorsements. Seems reasonable that Mark&rsquo;s &ldquo;Home-Court Advantage&rdquo; is actually a disadvantage vs NYC exposure</p>

<p>Mark wanted a number;
JBs agent didn&rsquo;t give a number;
Mark lowballed;
JBs agent didn&rsquo;t counter;
Mark asks for a number again, gets no response, thinks about offering a max but never did.</p>

<p>Also kind of shitty on Mark to not go to NY whether he says yes or no, he should have made that trip and at least find out what that Knicks offer was so he can counter instead of not showing up at all.  And out of all this it sounds like JB was kind of left in the dark.  Also the little things matter.</p>

<p>It almost reminds me of the COVID vaccine shit.  The overwhelming majority of US citizens were under the impression that once you get a vaccine for something that you&rsquo;re immune to catching it.  That&rsquo;s how most of us have been raised and how most people not working in the medical field thought things worked.  Once we realized that wasn&rsquo;t the case because of the COVID vaccine, we had the &ldquo;well acccctually&rdquo; people running all over Reddit pretending that this was common knowledge that every non-idiot had.</p>

      <label for="lkpvcb0" class="commentText"><p>I mean, yeah, people said the Knicks offer was an overpay at the time, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Mavs would have been laughed out of the room for maxing Brunson. I think the agent might have been able to get a little more money from the Mavs, but he was never going to re-sign without a significant pay difference, because he wanted to join his dad in New York. A pay difference that the Mavs (and probably any team, at the time) would not have been willing to provide. Realistically, it sounds like both parties got what they wanted here. Mavs didn&rsquo;t overpay for a player, Brunson got to join his dad in New York without losing out on too much money.</p>

      <label for="lkozpyb" class="commentText"><p>He seems super happy in NYC for sure.</p>

<p>But going from &ldquo;I want a max to stay in Dallas&rdquo;  to &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take 100m less guaranteed from the Knicks than what I could get and take your word you&rsquo;ll give me that larger deal to make up for that sacrifice in 4 years&rdquo; is a massively questionable choice in terms of financials.</p>

<p>The answer is Jalen likes the Knicks that much more than the Mavs.  And yes, it&rsquo;s super noble/respectable of Brunson to take that cut. But part of this clip makes it sound like Sam Rose may have lied to Brunson about the Mavs making an offer in the first place.  I wonder what the conversation around Brunson taking this massive haircut this summer looked like. I hope these people around him aren&rsquo;t intentionally/unintentionally setting him up to potentially get fucked over.</p>

<p>The Leon Rose/Sam Rose situation is sketchy in terms of Jalen getting what he deserves. This whole thing with his Dad gives me Lavar Ball vibes.  Maybe that&rsquo;s unfair/I&rsquo;m viewing the situation through shit-tinted glasses due to some of the shit we&rsquo;ve seen Lavar do.</p>

<p>Bur I think this is what Mark was really getting at with &ldquo;When the parents get involved.&rdquo;  The sub text around Mark&rsquo;s remark makes me seems like he means Brunson&rsquo;s dad and Sam Rose&rsquo;s dad.</p>
