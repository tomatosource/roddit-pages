      <label for="lknrgyi" class="commentText"><p>Especially since it has sort of worked out for both? Dallas had a great season last year, and Jalen is an All-NBA player on a now-competitive Knicks team. If the Mavs stunk last year, this interview probably doesn&rsquo;t happen, but I think having the conversation publicly is a good (albeit awkward at times) look for both sides, and hearing inside stuff like this is the whole point of athlete podcasts IMO.</p>

<p>They both also probably see the benefit of telling their sides of the story directly, rather than having reporters tell half-truths or just speculate.</p>

I think they&rsquo;re both trying to be professionals in a media setting when anything either of them say can be taken out of context and ran with. They&rsquo;re both being careful with how they phrase things, which ends up in a lot of awkward pauses and thinking.</p>

<p>Cuban wouldn&rsquo;t be on the show, nor would JB have invited him, if either of them were still really butt hurt. They both know it&rsquo;s a business, and they were both trying to do what&rsquo;s best for them. That&rsquo;s just how it goes sometimes.</p>

      <label for="lkmodx2" class="commentText"><p>Cuban had his chance, multimes times even, to sign Brunson but lowballed him every opportunity.  At the end of the day, this falls on Cuban for not getting the deal done when he should have (prior to him even hitting FA).</p>

      <label for="lkmrb8o" class="commentText"><p>And that&rsquo;s why we always see these max contracts given to meh players. Potential is very hard to evaluate, and most young/promising guys signed to big deals make it worth along the way. Had we not gambled on Brown on his second and third contract, we probably wouldnt have banner 18 by now. Cuban chose not to gamble and is paying for it.</p>

Mavs tried shopping him at the deadline to upgrade, no deal was made, Mavs went for extension but at that point Jalen was no longer interested/wanted to wait for FA to open, by then move to nyc was locked in</p>

      <label for="lkmkpxg" class="commentText"><p>He had a deal he reportedly would agree to, when only Dallas could offer. Cuban never denied this. There was no Knicks or anyone in the negotiation, he said he would take it but Dallas didnt offer or pulled it off the table. If negotiations got dirtier when competitors could compete, well that happens. But they fumbled the ball when there was no competition. And the man got a paycut on his current deal so I don&rsquo;t think he was lying about taking the deal if available.</p>

 would’ve or could’ve done something similar in the same situation.</p>

<p>The agent who happends to be Leon Rose&rsquo;s the Knicks GM son.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t really buy it though. Brunson&rsquo;s dad goes to the Knicks, Knicks make numerous salary cap moves moving picks to create space, Leon Rose is his godfather, his agent is Leon Rose&rsquo;s son, his dad&rsquo;s former agent is Leon Rose, he grew up as a Knicks fan.</p>

<p>Brunson and Knicks were committed to eachother, there&rsquo;s a reason they got fined for tampering lol. But they can&rsquo;t come out and just admit it lol.</p>

      <label for="lkma25e" class="commentText"><p>It &ldquo;worked out&rdquo; because the Mavs took a huge risk on Kyrie and got lucky that it hasn&rsquo;t bitten us, <em>so far</em>. The simple fact that Kyrie is so much older than Brunson means the Mavs like a 2-year window to compete before Kyrie probably can&rsquo;t be a legit #2 anymore, something that wouldn&rsquo;t have been an issue if Brunson hadn&rsquo;t tampered his way to NY.</p>

<p>I really couldn&rsquo;t care less about whether Brunson is a good guy or not. I&rsquo;m a fan of my team, not some dudes. Crazy in the modern world of NBA fans, I know.</p>

<p>Like common.. I really don&rsquo;t think Jalen or Mark didn&rsquo;t get along well. I also think the Mavs wanted to keep him for a certain $ amount, but you can clearly hear out of Mark&rsquo;s mouth that the agent really didn&rsquo;t want the Mavs on the table to negotiate. Mark doesn&rsquo;t say that the agent played dirty directly but Jalen should know better why he didn&rsquo;t hear anything back from the Mavs :) because the Agent didn&rsquo;t want him to.</p>

<p>Just my personal view on things here &hellip; I still believe it&rsquo;s better for both parties because the Mavs couldn&rsquo;t have given Jalen the role he deserved (Luka stays #1) and Jalen is maybe not the best player next to Luka if you got Kyrie.</p>

<p>But this is a great example how agents/family members whoever influence this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>The Mavs are asking the agent about a number yet don&rsquo;t hear anything back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s just poor management of the situation from their end. If you&rsquo;re going to go out publicly after the playoff series and talk about how you can give him the most money, then you shouldn&rsquo;t be relying on Brunson&rsquo;s team to tell you how much they&rsquo;re looking for. If you want to publicly talk about how you can pay the most money, and you want to keep the player, then it&rsquo;s on you to make that more expensive offer that you talked about making.  The agent isn&rsquo;t giving you a number because he wants you to make your best offer, and you bragged to the media already about what that best offer should be.</p>

<p>In fact, that offer should have been made clear before Brunson ever got to meet with the Knicks. </p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t require the agent getting back to you. It shouldn&rsquo;t require any negotiation. The mistake the Mavs made is, like Cuban said, thinking they had home court advantage. But the actual home court advantage they had was the ability to pay him more, and they shouldn&rsquo;t have required prodding to do that. </p>

<p>Overall, Mark&rsquo;s frustration over how it was handled from the Brunson side is very clear, and Brunson didn&rsquo;t do a lot to discount the reasons for that.</p>

<p>This makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p>Rick Brunson played for nine NBA teams in eight season in the league. He never had any control over his career.</p>

<p>So while he definitely did shady PR shit during Brunson&rsquo;s last year at Dallas&hellip;I can begrudge him some shady shit on behalf of getting his son to a place where he clearly enjoys playing so much and has so much more control over his career.</p>

      <label for="lkm544n" class="commentText"><p>IMO, I don&rsquo;t think Dallas lost Brunson in free agency.  They lost him in the past 3 times when they could have signed him before free agency.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The part of clowning on Dallas was, imo, about how they could have signed him cheap a year before free agency for a lot less, but would always counter with LESS than what brnson wanted (which was already little).  Then at mid-season they again offered less than what brunson wanted (which again, was less than he was worth).  Plus they also had him a trade chip &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Once free agency rolled around, Brunson was already thinking NY.  And Cuban pretty much says here that they never offered cause they wanted &ldquo;a feel&rdquo;.  Brunson stayed there waiting for an offer or convo but didn&rsquo;t get one.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Pretty much, both sides waiting for the other.  Dallas didn&rsquo;t want to offer too much (cuban mentions offering the max) and wanted to wait until Brunson put up an offer like he had done before (don&rsquo;t remember the numbers.  Like he wanted 36 million but dallas only offered in the <span class="math inline">\(20's and then in midseason Brunson wanted \)</span>64 but dallas offered around <span class="math inline">\(48 or \)</span>56).  Dallas expected Brunson to say, &ldquo;hey, I want 100 million&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lkmcxa4" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t remember anymore but they could have had him for a 14 to 16 million a year before he ever reached free agency. The big issue is that they gave him an initial rookie contract where he took a little less money than he could have in order to avoid restricted free agency.  The Mavs were always thinking they would be players for free agents so they were thinking that would be beneficial to clear up a few hundred thousand dollars on the cap. Because of that they had no way to keep Brunson.  This would have all been a moot point if they had given him a standard contract when they drafted him.</p>

      <label for="lkmf5t8" class="commentText"><p>2nd rounders don&rsquo;t have a standard contract. It could range from not being signed at all, two-way, to multi year non-guaranteed.</p>

<p>Dallas (Donnie) signed Brunson to a 4 year deal which would exclude Brunson from the Gilbert Arenas provision (He also gave Tyrell Terry the exact same contract 2 years later). Why? Well outside of drafting Luka and Brunson, Donnie had been a terrible GM at that point in time leading up to his &ldquo;discharge&rdquo;.</p>

<p>2019 free agency Dallas had 30M+ in free cap space and didn&rsquo;t spend any of it. That was Donnie&rsquo;s fault.</p>

      <label for="lkmxwnm" class="commentText"><p>Yes and yes. Apparently that deal was offered. According to dad not so much. Then he got played off the court when Batum clamped him. He won Utah, did nothing in LA.  Idk if that deal was offered it’s speculation here in Dallas but the tipping point was he was always trade bait. Mavs can’t have two ball hogs, JB eluded to that, and with that “offer” that contract was super valuable. The theory goes he’s offered, doesn’t like it rightfully so, then hears that he’s being shopped. His mind was made up quick.</p>

<p>Mavs could’ve paid more than others paid for these three players but never wanted to pay them.
Cuban did not extend Brunson 1 year or 6 months before the FA so he never valued him as he should.</p>

I think what everyone here is saying makes sense. The gms son, his dad, shit was happening.</p>

<p>They start by saying after we lose game 5.
Wasn’t there a longer saga to this? Like Brunson wanted to stay was ready to sign a deal but it didn’t get done. They said revisit after the season?  I don’t really remember, trying to understand.</p>

      <label for="lko4bg7" class="commentText"><p>Looks like a bit of blame is being put on the agent &amp; agent/JB relationship&hellip; but the money sort of makes sense.</p>

<p>The agent could easily value Knicks contract plus endorsements equal to Mavs max plus endorsements. Seems reasonable that Mark&rsquo;s &ldquo;Home-Court Advantage&rdquo; is actually a disadvantage vs NYC exposure</p>

      <label for="lknjmm4" class="commentText"><p>He probably was manipulated by people in his circle, but yes, he definitely wanted to go to NY. I think I see him realizing he probably wasn&rsquo;t told everything during negotiations. But, if Mark had come out and said, look, we&rsquo;ll give you the max to stay, his agent would be obligated to bring him that offer. Mark is being just as cagey here about the fact he didn&rsquo;t want to overpay to keep Jalen.</p>

      <label for="lkmowsq" class="commentText"><p>My take on this negotiation is Mark Cuban fumbled it badly. He was trying to get the number offered by the other team so he can negotiate a slightly better offer. He didn&rsquo;t make any offer. He just wanted the least amount to offer Jalen Brunson, just enough to keep him. And he didn&rsquo;t want to extend him when he could, start of the season and all-star break, and that&rsquo;s why he lost on this deal.</p>

<p>Any counter offer that is just same contract + 1 is a bad deal. And since the Mavs didn&rsquo;t  give any number, Brunson&rsquo;s agent made a good move staying silent and just listening to the most amount he can get for his client. He&rsquo;s not obliged to give any number and present any offer that has no number attached to it.</p>

      <label for="lknswhu" class="commentText"><p>Cuban could have offered the max, and may have during negotiations. Brunson/Rose wanted to go to NY long before an agreement was officially made and sabotaged any chance of resigning with the Mavs by acting like it was the team’s side at fault. Mavs fans were so mad at Cuban but this interview clears it up.</p>

      <label for="lknx409" class="commentText"><p>Nah, Cuban lowballed him during the season and used negotiating tactics after the season ended. He said in the interview he realized at the end only the max would do. Why didn’t he realize that sooner and make it clear to Brunson’s camp he’d offer the max as soon as free agency opened? Cuban has a history of lowballing free agents and it costing him. Nash is the biggest example but there a few others. Even though they made the final last year not paying Brunson was a big mistake as it made the Mavs to give up significant assets to get Kyrie, which they could’ve used instead to round out a team lead by Luka and Jalen.</p>
