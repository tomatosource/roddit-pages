<p>Three nights earlier, in a room not far from that practice court, all the members of the Spurs’ brain trust sat around a different table and came to a consensus. They were ready to draft a player at No. 8. They’d agreed on a prospect. And they were prepared to keep him.</p>

<p>But with seconds ticking away just before their pick was due, they received exactly the kind of offer they hoped would materialize Wednesday. The Minnesota Timberwolves wanted the Spurs’ selection, and they were willing to give up an unprotected 2031 first-rounder and the right to swap first-rounders in 2030 to get it.</p>

<p> Over the phone, the Timberwolves gave the Spurs a name — Rob Dillingham of Kentucky. Just beating the buzzer, the Spurs passed Dillingham’s name along to the league.</p>

<p>Risacher, Sheppard, Castle and Dalton Knecht. First two were off the board and they picked Castle so by process of elimination probably Knecht at 8, which is probably a little too high for him so they were happy to trade out.</p>

It&rsquo;s the other arguments against it I don&rsquo;t understand. There were reports of the value of the first pick in this draft being as good as a 11th in normal draft.  All year we hear how bad a draft class is.  Which would make the 8th pick about as good as #19 in a normal draft.  If you rate the draft this poorly it makes perfect sense to do the trade. It just comes down to how high you rate the prospects at #8 vs an average draft.</p>

      <label for="laxrxk4" class="commentText"><p>Think about it like this: it&rsquo;s 2 pick swaps. 8 for the 2030 first round, and the optional 31 swap. That makes it extremely high risk, high reward. The trade could end up 8th pick for the 23rd pick 6 years from now, and nothing else, or 2 top 5 picks. It&rsquo;s a lottery ticket, pun not intended.</p>

<p>The wildly mixed reaction to the price is eye of the beholder. Imo, the chance that it&rsquo;s nothing is high enough that it&rsquo;s super worth it to me, especially to get a rookie just on the tail end of fitting Ants timeline.</p>

<p>Dillingham is a good fit for the wolves who need some additional scoring and can hides his bad defence and the spurs get additional resources that can be traded for a star or stashed to give us more picks during wembys prime.</p>

      <label for="lay657f" class="commentText"><p>From a T-wolves standpoint, I get it.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t need a ball dominant star to take touches from ANT or KAT. They need an off-ball player who can space the floor. Defense is a plus.</p>

<p>Dillingham fits the mold perfectly, despite his lack of defense. Since T-wolves are in win-now mode, it makes sense they would pay a bit extra to get their role player.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>This is just blind optimism without any nuance.</p>

<p>Your only hole was back up point guard? So the Mavs beat the Wolves in 5 because of the backup point guard minutes?</p>

<p>My issue isn&rsquo;t the Wolves don&rsquo;t have a million picks, it&rsquo;s that they have no tradable picks they could use to make a deal for more of a sure thing this offseason or during the season. It&rsquo;s a big gamble for an undersized rookie point guard.</p>

<p>For someone capable doing all of that would be above a non taxpayer mle value.  Likely 15 m + aav.</p>

<p>Due to the cap situation, wolves were not capable of that option in free agency.</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s just a draft slot and unsigned, his rights are 0 for cap reasons.  We can trade draft picks without concern for cap space.</p>

<p>So this method of acquiring a talent was the wolves only option to get someone above a minimum deal.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth a premium to do so. I hope it pays off and the wolves are out of lottery when the bill comes due.</p>

<p>Not entirely true. First because you&rsquo;ve already given up worst of swaps on several of those picks now, so while you can still trade that you&rsquo;ve lowered it&rsquo;s value even more. And you can only trade those picks once you get to the draft. So you can&rsquo;t say trade a draft pick for a player this deadline that could fill a void and put the Timberwolves over the top.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s bad asset management to me and it&rsquo;s being done for again a guy that might be good but he&rsquo;s an undersized rookie point guard. Even if he pans out it likely won&rsquo;t be for a few years.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what other people have said and I really don&rsquo;t care if I&rsquo;m alone in my thinking as long as what I&rsquo;m thinking make sense. Which it does.</p>

<p>The Spurs didn&rsquo;t need a second rookie guard on their team, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a bad thing, the more bites at the apple the better, but that&rsquo;s what this trade gives them. They now get this future asset and a swap that they can leverage for anything really. They have flexibility. The Timberwolves don&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="laxvjmo" class="commentText"><p>The timberwolves are competing for a championship and added a player who fits their current (scoring PG off the bench) and future (take over for Conley, fits with Ant/McDaniels) timeline without exception.</p>

<p>Obviously too the Wolves have less flexibility than the Spurs - the wolves are coming a WCF run that they’re looking to improve upon while the Spurs won 22 games and don’t seem eager to improve much.</p>

      <label for="lay65q9" class="commentText"><p>This is very optimistic. As good as ant is (no guarantee he’s still there to begin with) he’s gonna need a proper team around him to compete. All stars do. We’ve seen players like Lebron and Luka miss the playoffs due to having weak supporting casts in the loaded west. And not all drafts are equal. The chatter around this draft was that a top pick was recipient to a mid lotto pick in your average year. That sentiment was also seemingly proven by all the teams that wanted to trade down/out but were not getting deals they wanted.</p>

      <label for="lay6w0p" class="commentText"><p>And even if they didn’t make the playoffs they’ll still likely have a better record than 8th worst in the league. Also just because a draft class is supposed to be bad doesn’t mean it always works out that way. We can argue all day about it but if I’m a GM there’s no way I’m trading the 8th overall pick to a team for just a first round pick 7 years from now and a pick swap 6 years from now. That’s a long ways away. Who the hell knows if we’ll even all be alive by that point the way this world is going. Obviously Spurs front office thought it was a good deal but I think them and fans like you might be the only ones naive enough to like this trade for the Spurs. I guess it all just depends on if Dillingham hits or not and I think he will and the trade will go down as a very stupid trade by their front office.</p>

      <label for="lay7ioi" class="commentText"><p>Maybe, but again that’s not really relevant because the 8th pick in two different drafts aren’t inherently the same value. And a draft being perceived as bad is what directly influences the value of the pick. IE if most teams could have the 1st pick this year or the 5th pick in 2018 knowing solely what we knew about the players before they entered the league, most would take the latter. The point is the teams shopping picks were not getting the returns offered that teams shopping picks in your average draft were. Obviously it’s different if Dillingham or a bunch of other players from around that pick turn into stars but the spurs seemed to not think that was the case, and most expert draft analysts seem to agree.</p>

<p>I think you’re either being obtuse or blindly optimistic here. The people that think it’s a bad trade for the spurs are the college fans that love Dillingham handles and think he’s a surefire star. Most of the people that have actually followed the draft, again both standard fans like those in the draft sub and the actual analysts that get paid to track and write about this stuff understand why it made more sense for the spurs to do what they did. Dillingham has historically bad defensive tools. In order to counteract that he’s likely gonna need to be a superstar offensive talent, which is just not a realistic bet to make. So it makes significantly more sense to add another future pick that they don’t have to make a decision about right away, can use for future deals, and has some fairly strong upside. How far away it is means nothing when the spurs are playing the long game and trying to build a dynasty to capitalize on wembys prime</p>

Wemby fell in their laps. And they’ve added a possible 3rd option in Vassell and solid rotation pieces in Sochan, Keldon, and hopefully now Castle, not to mention their other young players who could yet be something</p>

<p>It’s only been 6 years since Kawhi. Wemby just finished his rookie year. They’ve navigated this as well as anyone could’ve asked, and I’m going to give it a few years before I question their competence</p>

<p>Tijane Salun is a power forward. He plays the same position as Jeremy Sochan. Salun would be redundant.</p>

<p>Ron Holland would have worked, but Detroit picked him at 5th. Which, despite his lack of shooting, was the correct move for Detroit.</p>

<p>If the Spurs thought it was better to trade the 8th pick instead of drafting Topic, it shows how little they valued his incredible passing.</p>

      <label for="laxnu1n" class="commentText"><p>The Spurs already have a TON of draft capital that they can convert to a good player in the next few years.  They have 10 first round picks before 2029. Having the 2031 timberwolves pick doesn&rsquo;t change that or move the needle in any way for the next 2-3 years.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good for sure to have that extra capital. but acting like that specific trade and that specific 2031 pick is gonna help them within the next 2-3 years is completely silly considering how much capital they already had. I think chances are quite high that they hope the T Wolves fall off by that point and wind up hanging on to that pick until much closer to 2031.</p>

<p>Appreciate ya trying to clown me, but Im not saying anything crazy, I just don&rsquo;t expect that trade to help y&rsquo;all within 2-3 years, I think it was more of a long play.  I think it was a good trade.  the 2031 T Wolves pick is a good asset to have.  But since they already have 10+ FRP&rsquo;s in the next few years, I don&rsquo;t think it will mean anything in terms of improvin their team in the next 2-3 years.  They already had plenty of draft capital to do that.</p>

<p>Edit: Legitimately, can someone explain what I&rsquo;m so wrong about?  I&rsquo;m getting super downvoted and don&rsquo;t know what I said that was wrong haha.  Will gladly admit idiocy but I would love for someone to call me out on it.  I acknowledge it&rsquo;s probably a good trade, I am just pushing back on the idea that it was made to help them within 2-3 years.  It&rsquo;s more of a long play to me</p>

<p>how are those different?</p>

<p>I took their comment to mean that this particular trade will tangibly help them within the next 2-3 years.  Like that pick will be included in another trade to improve their team within 2-3 years.</p>

<p>They had the 8th pick in this years draft, and traded it for a 2031 first.  I don&rsquo;t expect that move to make their team better within 3 years.  that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.  I think it probably will make them better over a longer time frame</p>

<p>Dude.  No he isn&rsquo;t.  Read the entire thread. I think <em>you</em> are making good points, but you are totally wrong that your points are the same as what that person was trying to say.  They responded to this comment:</p>

<p>and they said</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to realize that they are saying that this particular trade should help them within 2-3 years of right now, as opposed to 7.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t agree with.  I think expecting this exact trade to make them better within 2-3 years is silly.</p>

<p>I think you are trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but their comment and the context around it absolutely implies they are expecting it to make the Spurs better within 2-3 years of right now instead of a long play.</p>

<p>Saying that their comment implied it would help them after 2027 is straight up wrong, that&rsquo;s not what their comment was saying.  Their comment was a direct retort to someone saying that.  You and I agree that that would be the better point.  But that&rsquo;s not what they said.  Hence my pushback</p>

      <label for="laxwuyn" class="commentText"><p>He said “probably in 2-3 years” as in 2-3 years, the Spurs will be trading the picks for an impact (All star) player to pair with Wemby and their other core. Nobody said trading for picks 7 years out will help them directly over the next 2-3 seasons but that they’ll eventually get an impact player with those picks in a trade 2-3 years from now.</p>

      <label for="laxnpwf" class="commentText"><p>Of course I have, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s realistic to expect having an extra 1st round pick in 7 years to have a tangible effect on you getting a player to help you in 2 years when you already have 10 First Round Picks in the next few drafts.</p>

<p>Like y&rsquo;all already have A TON of draft picks to play with and trade.  If ya wanted to translate those into a good player within 2 years, you could.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to have more draft capital, but I genuinely don&rsquo;t think having the Timberwolves 2031 FRP is gonna help you guys much in the next 2 years considering the already existing draft capital you have.</p>

<p>Edit:  Getting super downvoted but I&rsquo;m just confused haha.  Instead of downvoting I would love for someone smarter than me about the current CBA explain what I&rsquo;m missing here.  I think it was a good trade cause more draft capital is better, but how does this change their next 2-3 years when they already have a fuckton of picks to trade with?</p>

      <label for="laxq20v" class="commentText"><p>Firstly, I don&rsquo;t really care about it helping &ldquo;in the next 2 years&rdquo;. I mean how the team performs when Wemby is still 22 isn&rsquo;t really the goal. It&rsquo;s about what is gonna help the team become a high level contender over maybe 3-5 years and stay there in a consistent way, year after year.</p>

<p>Having an extra unprotected FRP and a swap just continues to increases future flexibility. Maybe they become cost-controlled young players that we can add to a contending team, especially if Minnesota have trouble maintaining a good team when they don&rsquo;t have control of any of their own picks for the next 7 years, and will be over the cap with just 3 players even after Gobert&rsquo;s current contract finishes.</p>

<p>But more likely, they became an extra pick-and-swap, that can be used to trump other trade offers if a star number 2 guys wants to join Wemby in 2-3 years, whilst still keeping us well clear of the Stepien rule, and still have other picks available to trade for good role players to fill out the roster.</p>

<p>My opinion is that when this team is hoping to contend, these picks will have more value than any player that was available at 8.</p>

<p>&hellip;okay, but you realize the <em>entire</em> point of my comment was as a response to this one, by a Spurs fan talking about when/why this trade would help them.  I was responding to someone who litearlly said they liked this trade to improve their team in the next 2-3 years</p>

<blockquote>
<p>probably in 2-3 years most likely.</p>

<p>Like, cool, that&rsquo;s not what you are focusing on.  I agree with you in a general sense, we are entirely on the same page that this was a good long term trade for the Spurs.  I think it was a good trade, I was disagreeing that it was a 2-3 year trade. I was responding to someone who <em>literally</em> said that, so&hellip;.maybe mind your own business?  You are arguing me as if I invented the notion that it would help the Spurs in the next 2-3 years, when I was literally responding to someone else who said that.  You and I are on the same page, dude &ndash; I think it was a good long term trade, I was disagreeing with the person suggesting it was a 2-3 year payoff.  Like you are attacking me for simply making a small counterpoint to someone else, and then you say &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t care about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>okay but that is literally the entirety of what I was responding to.  And have said more than once that in a general sense I think it was a good trade and will be good, I just don&rsquo;t expect that yall will reap the benefits of the trade within 2-3 years.</p>

So they can package those picks and matching salary for an all-star that wants to be traded between now and 2030 but I suspect it will be after next years draft because we are probably tanking one more year.</p>

<p>That still makes the statement &ldquo;it takes 5-6 first round picks to trade for an all star&rdquo; untrue.  There are a small handful of trades where 5 were traded but those were widely clowned on as overpays.  The Dejaunte Murray type trades are much more normal. Again, there has <em>never</em> been an instance of 6 FRP&rsquo;s going to another team, and there are also A TON of instances of all stars being traded for less than 4-5 FRP&rsquo;s in recent years.</p>

<p>Saying it is a necessity to have 6 trades to pick for an all star is objectively not true</p>

      <label for="laxps74" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s a swap too. The league changes so much so fast how can you really confidently say Edwards will be there or how good their team will be?</p>

<p>Just to be objective, I remember when the MCW for Lakers pick trade was supposed to be a big coup. It ended up being #10 in 2018 and traded for that super valuable 2021 Heat pick which dropped to #18 in 2021. I&rsquo;ll grant you those. But I&rsquo;m sure the Nets thought the same thing about their far out 2017 pick in the Celtics deal and the Grizzlies did too when they traded for old Otis Thorpe in 1997. That was the #2 pick in the 2003 draft that literally could have changed Grizzlies/Detroit as a franchise if it bounced their way. We tend to overstate how well teams can consistently maintain contenders years out by saying &ldquo;Oh they can just retool by then&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being 7 years out is a good thing… it means it stays in the pipeline and we’re in no rush to use it, and it can be used as is or in a trade once we’re in wemby’s prime. It means Minnesota has years and years to fall off and make the pick better. That seems significantly better than rolling the dice with a guy like Dillingham or Williams or whoever. All the prospects in this area of this draft have significant deficiencies and low star upside, it’s like throwing a dart blindfolded</p>

<p>And a hypothetical pick around #13-14 would likely be worth more than pick #8 from this draft anyways. This has been consensus among draft experts for months now. This was reinforced by the discourse around teams trying to move down in the draft after the lotto. It was reinforced by who was available at that pick and perception around those specific players. Just say you don’t have a clue what you’re talking about and move on. The fact that you suggested a pick swap between Minnesota and san  Antonio next season would’ve been better killed any credibility you originally had.</p>
