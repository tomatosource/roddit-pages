<p>Some extra notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The odds on favorite ended up in the finals <sup>28</sup>&frasl;<sub>44</sub> times (counting the 4 co-favorites twice), winning 19 and losing 9.</li>
<li>None missed the post-season, and only 4 favorites lost in the 1st round of the playoffs</li>
<li>The 2021-22 Nets had the lowest winning percentage of a favorite at .537 (44-38) and are the only favorite to not win a single playoff game, making them statistically the most disappointing favorite of the last 41 years.</li>
<li>The upcoming season with the 2nd best odds Knicks at +725 would be the lowest odds of the team leading &ldquo;the field&rdquo;</li>
<li>The 2017-2019 Warriors are the only teams to be minus favorites, making them the most foregone conclusions in history, and it&rsquo;s not really close.</li>
<li>The 2022-23 Celtics at +500 were the &ldquo;worst&rdquo; favorites in the last 41 years</li>
</ul>

<p>In the trash heap of rankings posts and the stupidest hypothetical questions, some people on this sub actually put up quality content.</p>

<p>2021 Lakers losing in the 1st round stands out; the other 15 of top 17 all made the Finals (except the 2021 Lakers and 2025 Celtics who are TBD)</p>

<p>In addition, using either pre-playoff odds or pre-finals odds, Jordan&rsquo;s 6 titles in those 6 title years is about equal to if Bron won 6.5 to 7 titles in his 10 title years&hellip;he won on 4. Really puts things into context</p>

      <label for="lcrdlrr" class="commentText"><p>What I kind of already knew. That the Spurs seemed to do better with a chip on their shoulder (usually against the Lakers, and then the Heat) rather than being told they were favourite:</p>

<p>4 of the 5 rings were from not being the favourite.</p>

<p>And they were 1 of 3 when being the favourite. (Actually 1 of 2, coz the 3rd one they were even with the Mavs)</p>

<p>(And yes - I know the outright stats wouldn&rsquo;t fully support this. Because it&rsquo;s <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> titles when favourite, and <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> in the years they weren&rsquo;t the favourite&hellip; but the numbers are still interesting).</p>

<p>I also think this is a counterpoint to (the few) people who still try to argue against Pop and Timmy&rsquo;s standing in the game by saying they were on these stacked super teams. Only being considered the outright favourite 2 times over 15 years doesnt really shout superteam to me.</p>

<p>24-25:</p>

<p>Celtics +300: 100/(100+300) = 25%</p>

<p>Knicks +725: 100/(100+725) = 12.1%</p>

<p>25-12.1% = 12.9% gap</p>

<p>96-97:</p>

<p>Bulls +100: 100/(100+100) = 50%</p>

<p>Lakers +500: 100/(100+500) = 16.7%</p>

<p>50-16.7= 33.3% gap</p>

<p>So in this case, there is a much larger gap with the bulls lakers when done this way, whereas just taking the difference in the odds makes it seem like theres a larger gap with the Celtics next season</p>

      <label for="lcrtnjr" class="commentText"><p>It should be noted that the odds keep changing before the season starts with every free agency move and where the money moves, it&rsquo;s not set in stone at the moment. The Celtics moved to +325 while the Nuggets, Thunder and 76ers are tied at +800, but for simplicity sake, I just used what basketball reference had (last updated with the June 28 odds). So you&rsquo;re not wrong saying the Thunder are up there. The thing that&rsquo;s holding them back is their top 3 guys have all never been to a conference finals. Last time a team won a championship with that little experience was the 2015 Warriors, and that took injuries in the finals. Before that, I have no idea if some team from the 70&rsquo;s or 60&rsquo;s had that little experience, it almost never happens. They were the youngest 1 seed in history last year and won 57 games and had all the makings of a contender and they lost in the 2nd round. So the Thunder should, under pretty much no circumstances, be the favorites.</p>

<p>The Celtics are still the overwhelming favorites and I don&rsquo;t think that will change with the available free agents left. The only thing that I think will close the gap for betting odds would be the Nuggets or 76ers getting high impact free agents on minimums, or something like a Markkanen trade. But this is more of a historical post anyway, the current year is more of just a throw in of how much the oddsmakers believe the Celtics will repeat.</p>

      <label for="lcravyg" class="commentText"><p>The thing that stands out the most to me is how accurate they are. I would be interested in seeing this for other sports.</p>

<p>I would have assumed basketball would vary the most from the expected odds of the major sports, aside from maybe baseball. Maybe it does, but I can&rsquo;t imagine being much more accurate than this.</p>

<p>Basketball in general has a lot of variance. It&rsquo;s kind of like baseball in that you can &ldquo;fail&rdquo; more than not and still be great, particularly with the increase in volume of 3 point shooting. A basketball player that hits 40% of their threes or a baseball player that gets on base 40% of the time are probably all-stars. A quarterback who completes 40% of his passes would be historically bad.</p>

<p>Sometimes a team just comes out hot and wins. Sometimes the best team in the league is cold and loses. There were 23 playoff games this year with a team shooting over 45% from three. Those teams went 22-1. 11 of those 22 wins, or exactly half, were the team that went on to lose the series.</p>

<p>And this is only taking into account shooting variance. With only 5 guys out there, I feel like smaller variance in player&rsquo;s play aside from shooting that you can&rsquo;t really measure is amplified. It&rsquo;s also harder to hide people who are slumping or having an off night.</p>

<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s just a case of the NBA typically generating a clear cut favorite or upper echelon that supersedes the variance you would expect to see. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just overestimating the variance some how.</p>

<p>I would be very interesting how well oddsmakers predict outcomes of middle-low seeded playoff teams. If that&rsquo;s way less accurate, maybe that lends some credibility to my idea of the league being top heavy offsetting the variance?</p>

<p>Why lol? It&rsquo;s one of the team sports with the least amount of variance due to points not being so valuable (compared to goals in NHL/Soccer, runs in MLB, points in NFL, etc&hellip;). The best (and healthiest) teams usually win 7 game series in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lcrnngn" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s more reasons that just that why NBA has the least variance. Of the top of my head:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A single player has far more impact on the game&hellip;and two or three players just multiply that effect.</p></li>

<li><p>The best players on a team generally are in the game about 80% of the game time. In football it&rsquo;s 50%, hockey 33%, and baseball the best hitter usually has about 11-15% of the plate appearances while a pitcher represents 50% when they are playing but generally play 66% of the game and every 4-5 games so about 8% of a series.</p></li>

<li><p>Lots of scoring and often driven through the top player or two. So the other players contributing on occasion have relative low impact compared to say the 6th best player on a hockey team that can have a goal and that could represent 33% of the teams scoring.</p></li>

<p>I agree though I would add the caveat that it&rsquo;s the best team in that match-up.  One team can be the best team in the league but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they are better than every team in a head to head match-ups.</p>

<p>For example, I think the Twolves were better than the Mavs but the Mavs were a terrible match-up for the TWolves and Mavs matched up better.</p>

      <label for="lcrmg2z" class="commentText"><p>Jordan is the goat for a reason.  These odds already factor in the impact the player has and Jordan&rsquo;s teams 5 times was pre-season favorites and he delivered all 5 times. He&rsquo;s by far the best clutch player ever&hellip;&amp; he won 6 straight titles when on a team by Feb&ndash; doing so with 3peats from 2 nearly entirely different teams.</p>

<p>In addition, using either pre-playoff odds or pre-finals odds, Jordan&rsquo;s 6 titles in those 6 title years is about equal to if Bron won 6.5 to 7 titles in his 10 title years&hellip;he won on 4. Really puts things into context</p>
