      <p>Hi everybody! I&rsquo;m from the UK and intend to get a league pass this year. Seems to me there are three options, league pass, league pass premium and team pass.</p>

<p>The differences between regular league and premium are obvious, but this isn&rsquo;t much info on the team pass (most likely as they want to publish you to purchase a more expensive option).</p>

<p>So with the team pass, do you get adverts/commercials in the game like the regular league pass, or is it in arena content like the premium?<br>
And as a second question, I will never be watching live due to time difference, so would I be able to just fast forward any commercials/in arena stuff anyway?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

      <label for="lne4npk" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m in Hungary so I guess we access the same content. Team pass and premium is the same content, it is just you get to see more games with the premium.</p>

<p>If I watch live, I do not get commercials, but since it is live, I get all the breaks since the play stops anyway. After the game, it takes some time, but they cut out all the breaks. So if you watch it in the morning your time, you will still have the breaks, but you can fast forward. If you watch it in the evening, the breaks are usually cut out by then, so you will only watch the game with no breaks.</p>

      <label for="lne7jds" class="commentText"><p>Thanks for the response! Yes I think the content will be exactly the same. So with Team pass the breaks are usually cut? If so this is great news as I&rsquo;m only interested in one teams games.</p>

<p>Also if my team makes it to playoffs, are those games available to Team pass?</p>

      <label for="lnefvtu" class="commentText"><p>Ok, I made a mistake. I just checked and there are 3 options, not 2. So you have the team option, league pass and league pass premium. I usually have the middle package, the league pass. It is supposed to have commercials, but I do not get those. Premium is offering multiple device usage and no ads. It is possible that some countries will have ads, but I do not remember getting those ever. The team option is not really worth it, since the price is almost the same as the normal one. I cheer for one team as you, but usually on Sundays there is an early game which is perfect timing for Sunday evening here in EU, I watch it sometimes. Also in the playoffs I might watch other teams, there are some good games there.</p>

<p>I do not know if the team one has the playoffs or not, you need to check it before commiting, for me it tries to point me to change my current sub which I do not wanna do.</p>

      <label for="lnemfqu" class="commentText"><p>Usually it is meaningless stuff. Also it depends on which stream you watch. You can pick home or away team, or if it is a nationally televised game, their broadcast is the default. I&rsquo;m gonna be honest, I do not really pay attention to the breaks, sometimes it is just a game break sign, sometimes in-arena event (probably this is the most common) and sometimes you get to see the arena crew, but they are on break I believe most of the time as well.</p>

      <label for="lnellrf" class="commentText"><p>You usually get to see the break animations for spectators like dance shows, cheerleaders, or games organised in the stands, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes you only have a screen with &ldquo;game break&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think for national games you get to see the halftime show sometimes but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure since I usually just tune out</p>

<p>Edit: by halftime show I meant the desk with shaq and ernie and all (or the espn version) but I&rsquo;m not positive on that</p>
