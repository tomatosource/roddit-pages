If he had the same skills but no chips, ppl around the world don’t watch. And lebron is a global phenomenon now. There’s no chance to bring the game to the world bc that’s already been done, ur counting something against him that he couldn’t possibly have achieved in this day. But that doesn’t matter, u were talking skills bro. And again, say what u said to any great basketball player ever and they would call u a joke, which u are.</p>

<p>Half his skills weren&rsquo;t even developed in &lsquo;87. MJ was heavily criticised coming out of college for having no jumpshot and he changed his game many, many times to be competitive with the changing league.</p>

<p>To say MJ had no skills when Kobe literally copied his game 1 to 1 and won 5 chips being his replica is legit only someone who knows nothing about basketball would say.</p>

<p>Here’s a recent pro-LeBron highlight. Just like this pro-Jordan one, where it’s not related to the other GOAT contender.</p>

<p>I’m scrolling through, and I do not see a single mention of Jordan in the top comments. I’m sure there’s some here and there, but certainly not as prevalent as this post where we already see, in a post with &amp;lt;60 comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only those who don’t understand basketball would want a clunky truck ramming through people to represent their sport instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was even an insane rebounder and got offensive boards at a good clip for a guard and better clip than SFs including guess who. Lebron lmao. Thats how good of a rebounder he was</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because they’re arguing in bad faith. They think Lebron’s seven assist career average in heliocentric offenses is better than Jordan averaging five in the triangle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because dem nephews be Bron glazers 😂</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way I look at it, LeBron has to rely on his teammates with his passing to do his thing. MJ didn’t need to cause he can do it himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously I have my own biases, but I think any neutral observer would agree that no, this phenomenon is not equally as common for both players on r/nba. LeBron posts generally stick to being about LeBron, Jordan fans want to make Jordan posts become about LeBron.</p>

<p>Jordan fans don&rsquo;t ever waiver or doubt that Jordan is the GOAT. Call it bias or hype or nostalgia, but if you&rsquo;ve ever thought Jordan was the best player ever you just never change your mind from that.</p>

<p>The fact is that MJ did what was required to win, and the Bulls generally needed him to score rather than be the primary facilitator. But when it was required he could pass with the best of them - they really ought to watch the 1991 Finals where he put up <sup>31</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.5&hellip; His 37 pt 13 assist game 3 (where I think he shot 15-18 and I think hit like 14 straight shots) is one of his best games ever imo</p>

      <label for="lobx0he" class="commentText"><p>He could do it all, but he played his role within a system. I believe Lebron is a more naturally gifted playmaker/passer than him, but it wasn&rsquo;t as big a gap as many people pretend it is. And Jordan is clearly a better offensive rebounder than Lebron, which means he is a better rebounder even as a guard over a guy built like a power forward.</p>

This highlight is nice, but all players at the pro level are capable of making nifty passes at times like this. You shoot the ball 23 times a game you’re GOING TO run in to opportunities to get assists no matter what lol.</p>

      <label for="locis37" class="commentText"><p>Bro why you such a hater. Jordan&rsquo;s passing was honestly only shadowed by his other skills. The way he fakes with palming the ball (shot fakes, pass fakes, anything) is godly. Not only that but everything he does; dunking, shooting, dribbling, he is the most emulated player arguably ever.</p>

<p>Talking about raw athleticism Jordan definitely has competition, like your boy LeBron definitely has better longevity and straight up power, same with players like Wilt and Bill. Kareem has the signature sky hook, Magic was the original point God, but Jordan was the walking aesthetic of basketball. You can probably argue that at every skill there&rsquo;s likely one maybe two person better than MJ, but MJ was basketball itself. What Steph Curry did for the 3 pointer is what MJ did for basketball in its entirety. He really is the best example of only being able to be replicated but not replaced.</p>

And his passing wasn’t great, it’s around what you’d expect from an all star 2, throwing fancy passes doesn’t make u a great passer. He has wonderful ball control and feel for the game so of course he can make nifty passes like anyone who plays basketball for an amount of time can. I know a lot of ppl here never really played competitively but if u did, minus the palming, these are passes a really good high school player can make. No looks, behind the back, over time u develop the court awareness to do that type of thing. He never controlled an offense thru his passing and facilitation, and that’s fine.</p>

<p>Of course not. Neither him, nor Jordan, nor any all-time great other than the stray Westbrook maybe, played to pad their assists.</p>

The simplest explanation to why he doesn&rsquo;t get assists is because he scores, and when you&rsquo;re winning and scoring at that clip the right play is to always get the ball in the basket, not to pass it.</p>

      <label for="lod4pa9" class="commentText"><p>Take the dick out your mouth is an expression, lol. I guarantee u MJ and Lebron fans alike have used it plenty. It’s not a phrased based on basketball fandom I assure you. And he does? Let me check. “Michael Jordan averaged 33.6 points, 6.0 rebounds and 6.0 assists in 35 games in the NBA Finals in his career.” Ok now Lebron. “LeBron James has averaged 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds and 7.8 assists in 55 games in the NBA Finals in his career.”</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re talking out your ass about most NBA players making these kinds of passes look routine. Most of them don&rsquo;t, which is why these kinds of highlights exist.</p>

<p>The way I look at it, LeBron has to rely on his teammates with his passing to do his thing. MJ didn’t need to cause he can do it himself. He could absolutely pass, but why pass when you are the best to carry this team? That’s how you know you’re the greatest on planet earth.</p>

He has wonderful ball control and feel for the game so of course he can make nifty passes like anyone who plays basketball for an amount of time can.

<p>Putting him as a good but not all time great passer isn&rsquo;t underrating him.  Nobody suggests that he is an incompetent passer, but he&rsquo;s not on the same level as the all time greats, and this clip does nothing to change that.</p>

<p>TBH presenting this as a &ldquo;highlight reel&rdquo; of his best passes probably hurts his case more than helps it.  If that is supposed to be a reel of his best passes it is&hellip; a bit&hellip; pedestrian?</p>

<p>This reminds me of that other thread where some people were saying LeBron was as good or better than Magic at playmaking, it&rsquo;s just goofy fanboy nonsense.</p>

<p>You see passes like most of those every day in the NBA.  Half of them were desperation plays &ldquo;uh I&rsquo;m in the air and am gonna get blocked if I shoot, I&rsquo;ll toss it towards a teammate and hope it turns out&rdquo; , then there are easy transition passes with exaggerated &ldquo;no look&rdquo; head movement, basic pocket passes and that last pass on the reel was about the most mundane shit ever.</p>

<p>There were like two in that entire reel that were actually impressive.</p>

I&rsquo;ll also take Bird over him as a passer as he was more imaginative with his passes, especially the quickness with which he made decisions with some of his passes. For most of the passes by Jordan in the reel it was his quick thinking, ball fakes and instincts that made them fun, not the level of difficulty or creativity.</p>

<p>All of the above, and I <em>highly</em> rate Bird in all those categories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kidd was also a better technician with better vision than Lebron.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what you mean by &ldquo;technician&rdquo; but the only player I&rsquo;ve ever seen play with court vision that was clearly better than LeBron&rsquo;s was Magic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With Lebron his size and athleticism gave him a big advantage as a playmaker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bird was taller than LeBron, and a ton of his passing leveraged that fact, just like Jokic heavily abused the height advantage.   Still, that&rsquo;s fair game.  Being bigger and faster gives you an advantage and makes you more effective.   You don&rsquo;t get a handicap or bonus points for being small, or Muggsy would be the GOAT for what he was able to do at his size.</p>

<p>Was in a very similar conversation about Curry the other day where someone was acting as if he’s actually just as good of a passer as the best ever, just chooses to play off-ball more… like, lol</p>

<p>I’d go as far as to say Jordan was a <em>great</em> playmaker. But not all-time great. That’s the likes of Magic, Nash, CP3, Jokic, LeBron (roughly in that order), among others, to me. Jordan’s not in the discussion, and that’s okay!</p>

      <label for="loclcot" class="commentText"><p>Another point that people miss is coaching. MJ had the best coach in history and everyone on the team followed his lead. Phil knew how to play MJ and the rest of the team to win, and the best way to play MJ is to have him shoot the ball. LeBron more or less is always running the show on and off the court which is not something that was all that common back then, and that really contributes to his assists but also less consistent playoff record.</p>

<p>I think people saying Curry could&rsquo;ve been a top 3 passer if he tried is kind of pushing it, but if his 3 pointer wasn&rsquo;t as good he definitely would have developed his other skills more and be a better passer for sure. Point being, if you have Steph Curry on your team, you don&rsquo;t make him pass, you make him shoot as many 3s as possible. You have MJ on your team, you make him shoot the ball.</p>

I was not a Jordan fan as a kid , I couldn’t stand him Cos all he did was win n beat teams I liked , then he retires and I missed him the nba missed him, he came out of retirement and I instantly became a fan , I even saw him play in Washington  2 games. 37 and 43 points.  It made me think of his quote where every game he played in he would tell himself someone here has never seen him before and might never again , what a impression he leaves</p>
