</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Lately ive been seeing a lot less European NBA players. I think about 15 years ago there were far more players who were mid to end of bench level guys who were European than they are now.</p>

<p>You can bring up Luka, Jokic, Wemby, etc but I think if you aren‚Äôt talked about as a star player you are now far less likely to make the trip to North America now than ever before.</p>

<p>Im just going to list the reasons why staying in Europe may be getting more appealing than the NBA</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Culture shock - If ur lucky you may end up in LA or NY where there‚Äôs a greater chance you run into your own people. Chances are you can end up in a city where no one knows ur language, culture, etc to a boring area Sacramento, Indiana, OKC.</p></li>

<li><p>Will get bounced around the league - Never get to find ur own footing in a city and your job security is always at risk</p></li>

<li><p>Fans and media still doubt euro players - They don‚Äôt get the respect they deserve and if you are young and you constantly hear how you don‚Äôt belong you may not trust your game</p></li>

<li><p>Different game - NBA game is faster and players who can‚Äôt keep up are quickly weeded out. Not to say certain euro players aren‚Äôt good but they need a slower pace to excel. Rotational euro players I felt were doing better with the slower pace before 2015 but now you can‚Äôt be slow footed in the league anymore</p></li>

<li><p>You are the man in Europe - If you are good enough to be an end of bench guy in the NBA you are good enough to be a star in Europe. Why wouldn‚Äôt I go to a place where I can be the man and get love from my team and country.</p></li>
</ol>

Look at what Micic is earning now.¬†
For NBA standards it‚Äôs pocket money yet he couldn‚Äôt make that much in Europe.</p>

<p>You are also forgetting the fact that players want to compete at the highest level possible. It‚Äôs more important than being ‚Äúthe man‚Äù.</p>

      <label for="lm8puug" class="commentText"><p>For a non star it‚Äôs absolutely worth a flier. You‚Äôre basically holding out for a second contract as that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre likely to make a fuck ton of money.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario you either bomb out or hate living in the US and return home to be a superstar. Mirotic is an example. Dude made ~40 million in 5 years and then dipped out</p>

      <label for="lm8p851" class="commentText"><p>Hey! As a Euroleague watcher, I think you‚Äôre definitely on to something with points 1 and 2. I‚Äôm not sure about 3 as euro fans a pretty brutal regardless.</p>

<p>4 - different game, definitely different but in the NBA if you‚Äôre a euro guy you either ain‚Äôt playing much, or you‚Äôre resigned to sit in the corner and basically just shoot. In Europe the offences are much more intense, difficult to guard and have a lot more movement (aside from Monaco) so it definitely feels more like a team game rather than a iso game with a couple sidekicks.</p>

<p>I think it ties into point 5 as well, in the NBA mirotic was just a catch and shoot guy but in Europe with Barcelona he was used in so many interesting and creative sets to utilise that shooting beyond just shooting set shots.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like some recommendations to watch more Europe ball happy to help!</p>

      <label for="lm8rlh2" class="commentText"><p>Another reason is that it&rsquo;s more of a team ball because of the lack of a superstar on the team. It changes a whole lot having superstars on a team. You can see the micro example in Greek Olympic team and to some extent this sebian team vs the previous other team ( present and previous Jokic).
NBA seasons are intense. # of NBA playoffs it almost  equivalent to the entire season of Euro.
Finally the most.important thing is NBA is a business and a corporation. As much as we love Vic Wemb and he will be a superstar he won&rsquo;t be the face of the NBA. Iykyk.</p>

<p>France‚Äôs¬†Guerschon Yabusele should be an interesting case study. He was pretty shit with the Celtics but was fantastic in the Olympics. We‚Äôll see what a few years developing in Europe has done for him.</p>

      <label for="lm8seaz" class="commentText"><p>As a European citizen, I&rsquo;m not quite sure that point 1. holds any validity. Almost al EU citizens under the age of 35 are sufficiently capable of speaking, reading and writing English. And we&rsquo;re all pretty used to seeing/encountering different cultures than our own.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that most European countries aren&rsquo;t that &ldquo;big&rdquo; compared to the United States and that there&rsquo;s free traffic between EU countries. So it is certainly common to travel between those countries for Holidays, work, &hellip; And a lot of EU students participate in Erasmus projects to study abroad in other EU countries etc. If you&rsquo;re living in Belgium, The Netherlands, northern France, southern Germany, &hellip; pretty much all EU capitals are only a two-three hour flight away.</p>

<p>As for 3 and 5, I&rsquo;d think that pretty much every EU basketball player dreams about playing in the NBA. Even if you&rsquo;re &ldquo;only&rdquo; a role-player.</p>

<p>Point 4 will probably be highly subjective for each different player. Some players will adapt more easily. Others will not. So, sure. The NBA probably isn&rsquo;t suited for most players.</p>

<p>Point 2 might definably hold some truth. I do think you&rsquo;re way more likely to get bounced around in the NBA, with is taxing on your personal life. Also, the travelling within the season is something that might tax EU players more too. The US is a big country. Long distance travel and road trips occur more often than in the Euroleague, I think. Though it&rsquo;s hard for me to say. A lot of Eastern EU people have kin who work abroad in Central EU countries for months or years (because they get paid better). So this might be more common for them than it is for Central EU citizens.</p>

<p>Getting bounced around can happen whether you&rsquo;re European or not.</p>

<p>Who says you&rsquo;re going to get love from your country just because you play in Europe? You think Italians care more about an Italian player playing in Turkey than in the NBA?</p>
