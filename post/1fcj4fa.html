</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Lately ive been seeing a lot less European NBA players. I think about 15 years ago there were far more players who were mid to end of bench level guys who were European than they are now.</p>

<p>You can bring up Luka, Jokic, Wemby, etc but I think if you aren’t talked about as a star player you are now far less likely to make the trip to North America now than ever before.</p>

<p>Im just going to list the reasons why staying in Europe may be getting more appealing than the NBA</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Culture shock - If ur lucky you may end up in LA or NY where there’s a greater chance you run into your own people. Chances are you can end up in a city where no one knows ur language, culture, etc to a boring area Sacramento, Indiana, OKC.</p></li>

<li><p>Will get bounced around the league - Never get to find ur own footing in a city and your job security is always at risk</p></li>

<li><p>Fans and media still doubt euro players - They don’t get the respect they deserve and if you are young and you constantly hear how you don’t belong you may not believe it</p></li>

<li><p>Different game - NBA game is faster and players who can’t keep up are quickly weeded out. Not to say certain euro players aren’t good but they need a slower pace to excel. Rotational euro players I felt were doing better with the slower pace before 2015 but now you can’t be slow footed in the league anymore</p></li>

<li><p>You are the man in Europe - If you are good enough to be an end of bench guy in the NBA you are good enough to be a star in Europe. Why wouldn’t I go to a place where I can be the man and get love from my team and country.</p></li>
