<p>this could somewhat be sixers vs lakers if you had to pick. helio centric superstar carrying the team (not so much this playoff but usually is). vs the powerhouse dynamic duo with star role players. even like derek fish to derek white/jrue, horry to houser i dunno</p>

The talent has been there, but can they actually rise up to the occasion and execute when necessary. If they can’t and they make silly mistakes, the Mavs will eat them alive. If they can keep their shit together, I don’t think too many of the games will be particularly close.</p>

      <label for="l75oc03" class="commentText"><p>The Pacers had one of the best offenses in the history of the league this season. They are also more than just Halliburton. The Mavs don’t play anywhere near that pace. They also don’t matchup well against the Celtics on defense. I know Luka and Kyrie have “turned it around” on defense but come one man, you really think offensive minded players suddenly become defensive specialists overnight? Luka has a hard time guarding Tatum and Brown. Kyrie has a hard time guarding Tatum and Brown. 1-5 can all shoot 3’s at a high efficiency, so the Mavs perimeter defense has to be locked in all game long. The Celtics are pretty deep too, to the point where Tatum or Brown can have an off night and the offense doesn’t slow down. The Mavs don’t have that luxury. Luka and Kyrie absolutely cannot have any stinkers. Where it could get interesting is the Celtics are often susceptible to role players getting hot because they’re so focused on limiting star players. Which random Mavs player is going to go nuclear from 3 for a game or two and will it be enough to win a game for them? Could be. I still feel however that if both teams play to their ceiling, the Celtics are going to win the series in something like 5-6 games.</p>

      <label for="l75u2mb" class="commentText"><p>Luka and Kyrie certainly aren’t great defenders but they fared just fine against the Wolves, and the mavs play excellent team D to help cover their deficiencies. The Pacers were historically bad on defense so I don’t see how Dallas could be worse. I also think the Celtics lack of true playmaking will hurt them.</p>

<p>Dallas may not have the same pace as Indy but Luka and Kyrie with shooters and lob threats is pretty damn dangerous. </p>

<p>I just think it’s a close series barring injury regardless, guess we’ll see</p>

Good passers, but no one who is the level you often find on title contenders. There was a post here about this recently, suggesting that their lack of top level playmaking is a reason they take so many iso shots, though they&rsquo;re pretty good at making them.</p>

      <label for="l749n8y" class="commentText"><p>The cakewalk advantage Boston had (yes, because of the injuries, I&rsquo;m calling their road to the Finals a cakewalk) will thankfully be minimized with the long pre-Finals break giving the Mavs a rest.  No shade at Boston on this, as they can only play who&rsquo;s in front of them.</p>

<p>Kudos to the sports world for finally realizing things like this can be talked about.  Getting lucky with playoff matchups is frequently a massive contributor to winning titles.  I hated it 20 years ago when people would simply cuss you out for bringing it up like that somehow minimized the accomplishment.  Luck is a thing in sports - no shame in that.</p>

The Celtics&rsquo; starting 5 has no weak link on defense, and they don&rsquo;t play the way other teams did regarding blitzing Kyrie/Luka. They have the personnel in Jrue/White/Tatum/Brown to be able to hold up good enough 1-on-1 against said 2 players.</p>

And say what you want about the teams being weak but Mitchell and Haliburton both played for more than half of their respective series, and the Celtics went 8-1 over that stretch. And this leaves aside the fact that Brown and Tatum have clutch playoff performances under their belt, like Tatum’s 51 point Game 7 against the Sixers last year. You don’t watch the Celtics obviously so why even give your opinion</p>

<p>You put maxi on kp and let dlive/gaff roam off of Jrue. You then switch and close out hard on Jrue&rsquo;s threes, and live with him making decisions off the bounce. You are gonna ask them to make the correct pass to the open man, which they should be able to do, but no one in this team is an incredible passer so maybe that&rsquo;s exploitable.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s not a perfect plan, I&rsquo;m sure the celtics are gonna have a great offense even in the best scenario, but at least you are able to stay big. Dallas are gonna have to be cooking the Celtics on offense if they wanna win, thats for sure.</p>

<p>Also, just because it&rsquo;s a team game, doesn&rsquo;t mean some people put in more work than others.</p>

<p>Edit: I also just want to say this. I have mad respect for Kyrie, he has slowly made me a fan of his. But let&rsquo;s not pretend this dude wasn&rsquo;t using PTO like every month up until this season&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l75cos5" class="commentText"><p>no one is saying jayson tatum is bad. but luka and kyrie have some insane stats. kyrie in 14-1 in elimination games (the one loss being game 4 in the minnesota series). Luka averages 35.0 ppg in elimination games throughout his career. And they have continued to do this against very tough competition this playoffs.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I think if the celtics have at least a two game advantage, they are much more likely to get a bad Luka/Kyrie game and win the series.</p>

      <label for="l718yah" class="commentText"><p>On paper it looks like Boston.</p>

<p>Kristaps/Horford are probably a better front court.</p>

<p>Luka/Kyrie a better back court.</p>

<p>But as a unit White/Tatum/Jrue/ Brown can probably equal Kyrie/Luka output. So the game will be won by the bigs.</p>

<p>That said I think people over complicate analysis. It comes down to who are the superstars and how they play. I&rsquo;d put my money on Luka and Kyrie. If they level up one more time they are unstoppable.</p>

Boston entered the seasn as a &lsquo;superteam&rsquo; with 5-6 AllStars/former AllStars. Dallas has been termed a &lsquo;flawed&rsquo; team even after the Gafford/PJ trade its &lsquo;Luka and nobody&rsquo; + a shtty coach Kidd. Its not even close.</p>

<p>with that said, Boston in 4.</p>

And KP has been injured recently and we know he always takes some time to get his groove back. I&rsquo;ll take our frontcourt any day. Boston has the better perimeter offense so if they can get hot from 3 we might be in trouble. But we managed to run OKC off the line, so I&rsquo;ll take our chances.</p>

      <label for="l73c1mu" class="commentText"><p>The front court was the Mavs weakness going all the way back to the 2022 WCF when Kevon Looney dominated the team.</p>

<p>The Mavs became a completely different team post trade deadline because they had a deep enough of a front court to rotate guys out every couple of minutes. The consequence is that you always have bigs sprinting everywhere at full speed all 48 minutes. So far in the playoffs, no team has had an answer to that.</p>

<p>I think the series will come down to how much the Mavs rotations and energy affect the Celtics bigs.</p>

<p>KP is coming off injury and Al is old. Both are more talented and on paper the Celtics have a massive front court advantage, but fresh legs can beat tired legs. If the Celtics can&rsquo;t successfully rotate to combat that, I do think Al and KP are going to get cooked.</p>

<p>Typically in the playoffs, starters get more minutes. When it comes to the front court, that has played in to Dallas&rsquo; hands big time in every series so far.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Celtics are deep enough to mitigate this. I&rsquo;m not worried about Al and KP, I&rsquo;m worried about Kornet and Hauser. If Dallas can&rsquo;t run the Celtics front court off the floor it will be because the Celtics are deep. Dallas can sure as shit bring more energy than old Al and bad knees KP can keep up with over the course of a game.</p>

      <label for="l74atp3" class="commentText"><p>If you’re more worried about Kornet than you are KP, I don’t think you follow the Celtics much. KP is an all around better defender who have 20 ppg on 63% TS this season. He was basically an offensive cheat code and outlet for the Celtics. He’s not the mavs KP you saw, he’s completely different.</p>

<p>Al is also a 40% three point shooter so again, you should really be worried about him given your defense being one to just clog the paint and not give up shots at the rim.</p>

<p>The Mavs do not run a clog the paint defense. I don&rsquo;t know where you are getting that from. You can&rsquo;t have watched the Mavs play.</p>

<p>Of all the opposing fanbases in the series so far, the Celtics fans have shown the least knowledge of the Mavs team and least basketball knowledge in general by a country mile.</p>

<p>Yes, the mavs do run that type of defense. They did against the Thunder sagging off Chet + Dort and they did against the Wolves sagging off Rudy + Anderson.</p>

<p>I appreciate that you’re trying to say I’m the least knowledgeable about ball yet you quite literally don’t know what defense your team plays and you think Gafford + lively are better than KP + Al LOL. I have a feeling you’ll be in for a rude awakening watching KP and Al put up 35 points together this first game.</p>

<p>Yeah, just no. And that&rsquo;s not a knock on KP it&rsquo;s a statement that you don&rsquo;t watch basketball.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m well aware that he can hang 30 on anyone.</p>

<p>Gafford and Lively aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;better&rdquo; than KP and AI but the Mavs front court rotation which is more than just the two bigs, will try and might succeed in running them off the floor.</p>

<p>I mean also Lively, Gafford, and Kleber just aren’t good enough to run anybody off the court, I’m sorry. Lively might become a bonafide stud in a few years but right now he’s a lob threat who can decently pass and is a solid rim protector. You’re not running someone like KP, or even Al, off the court with that.</p>

<p>Especially given JT will be covering the centers most likely for large parts of the game??</p>

Boston leads 3:0 vs Dallas in the regular season. But Dallas has been a different animal since the trade. They are fake #5 in the West because they have the best record in the West since the trade deadline. The last time they played (the only time they played after the trade), THJ got 20 minutes, Gafford 5 minutes, DJJ 7 minutes. This is gonna change drastically. Safe to say Dallas has been getting better throughout the season. I consider Luka&rsquo;s dad as the goat of predictions and he predicted Mavs to win so I&rsquo;m rolling with this.</p>

You really hold a team that has been together for 1.5 months to the same standard as a team that has been together for 6 months? Since the deadline Mavs got the best stats in the west.

      <label for="l721apz" class="commentText"><p>My bad. Yes 2-0. Not talking about DJJ, more like PJ+DJJ+Gafford being with the Dallas team for more than a month lol. BOS is 1-1 against Minnesota (Dallas destroyed them). 1-1 vs Clippers (Dallas destroyed them). 0-2 against Nuggets (rekt by Minnesota). 1-1 vs OKC (Dallas destroyed them). Mavs are 1-3 against Minnesota in the regular season (4-1 in the playoffs). Mavs are 1-2 against Clippers (4-2 in the playoffs). 1-3 vs OKC (4-2 in the playoffs). If you think Dallas team from 2nd March (about a month after the trade line) is the same as it is right now, you better get off the internet for today. If you think Mavs aren&rsquo;t better by a lot in these playoffs compared to the regular season, get off the internet for today. I don&rsquo;t consider 1 H2H game (1 month after the trade deadline, on the road) to be a good enough sample for making any conclusions. Among relevant teams, Dallas is the team that changed the most in the last trade. Dallas has a losing record against all top 4 teams in the West, but they comfortably cruised through 3 of them in the playoffs which means Mavs are a different dog than they were in the regular season. Much different.</p>

      <label for="l72ds1z" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure a 4-2 victory against a team essentially missing its best player counts as &ldquo;destroying&rdquo;.</p>

<p>More broadly, I&rsquo;m not sure how your takeaway from &ldquo;three teams that won the regular-season series against Dallas lost to it in the playoffs&rdquo; is &ldquo;Boston is doomed because it lost the regular-season series against a few teams that aren&rsquo;t even playing in the playoffs anymore&rdquo;. Specific regular-season series just aren&rsquo;t very meaningful&ndash;the sample size is way too small.</p>

<p>Also, it turns out that matchups are important&ndash;probability of winning isn&rsquo;t transitive. One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that Dallas feasts on teams trying to play mediocre shooters&ndash;they lost the non-Giddey minutes against OKC but destroyed them when Giddey was playing, Minnesota&rsquo;s offense really struggled when Gobert and/or Anderson were on the floor. Luka&rsquo;s on-ball defense is genuinely looking decent but he&rsquo;s still not crisp in off-ball rotations and screen chasing, and Dallas&rsquo;s defensive strength being overwhelmingly in its frontcourt mean that it wants to have them in the paint. Lively and Washington have seemed fine defending shooting bigs on the perimeter, but the team defense suffers if they can&rsquo;t offer help defense. I think the Celtics&rsquo; #1 offense presents a significantly greater challenge than Dallas&rsquo;s defense has yet faced.</p>

      <label for="l73ucir" class="commentText"><p>These are all good points, but all your points tilt one way favoring one direction. &ldquo;Dallas did this good, but&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>Equally as much, the Celtics won the most games, but, it was in the weaker East. They won the east, but, against an injury plagued east. They probaby would&rsquo;ve won the east even if the other teams were not injured, but the Pacers kept that series in a way thinner margin than it should have been, much smaller than they should have been even without Porzingis.</p>

<p>And they did that with just McConnel, Siakam, and Halliburton (2 games).</p>

<p>Players of that caliber are doing this to the Celtics, but none of those players are anywhere near the caliber of Luka Doncic. None of them are even at Kyrie Irving&rsquo;s level right now. The Mavericks have the clear #1 player right now in this series, and that counts for a lot.</p>

<p>Equally as much for the Celtics, a big factor is two big men that can pull the rim protector out the paint with great shooting to stifle parts of the Maverick defense, and have the athleticism to help on Luka/Kyrie on penetration, while recover on a dump off too. Along with peremiter defenders in Tatum Brown and Holiday. Jayson Tatum is like a lab created perfect small forward (although I am questioning if the team&rsquo;s reputation and what looks like should be a great team defense on paper, is actually a good team defense, based on the results of the Pacers series). And Luka Doncic has a hurt knee is a factor too.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not really much to go on right now with full certainty who will win until at least one game.</p>

      <label for="l7132oq" class="commentText"><p>Celtics have more pressure to win it than the Mavs, but Celtics have also cleaned up pretty efficiently (albeit their opponents are mostly injured/missing players).</p>

<p>Mavs have a dangerous backcourt that can score as much if not more than Boston&rsquo;s Jays. And Mavs have younger players probably playing with less pressure but for the first time under the spotlight of a Finals.</p>

<p>I think Celtics in 7, but could be wrong.</p>

<p>I think in hindsight, we can agree that &ldquo;Porzingis was not as essential as earlier thought&rdquo;. But there was I feel that brief &ldquo;uh oh&rdquo; moment when Porzingis limped out so early in the Playoffs.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all just collectively forgotten he was the 51% FG guy on that team.</p>

<p>Boston would have probably needed Porzingis against a healthy Knicks team, but I think the Cs without Porzingis would&rsquo;ve beat any other fully-healthy East team including the 76ers and Bucks.</p>

<p>I feel like Porzingis can&rsquo;t come back and it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;Regular Season Mode Celtics: Switch On&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a changed team somewhat.</p>

<p>Part of me wonders if Porzingis will even start the Finals against the Mavs. Like you said they&rsquo;ve been strong without him. So they could - which is either brilliant or supremely risky - run KP as a 6th man during Game 1. Run him in the 2nd quarter, and if he&rsquo;s switched on he does the 4th quarter as well and it&rsquo;s like&hellip;. &ldquo;There is no tape where the Celtics did this&rdquo;. So you can&rsquo;t prepare for it.</p>

      <label for="l7180y8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. I for one believe in the &ldquo;system&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t believe the Celtics somehow are less deserving of their Finals berth. There was probably pressure on them to make it because they were ranked No. 1 across the entire league.</p>

<p>But now they&rsquo;re in that place where they&rsquo;ve lost before so now it&rsquo;s just them or the Mavs who can be Champions.</p>

<p>The Mavs come in as really the team with the brightest superstar combination on the grid.  No disrespect to the likes of Nikola Jokic. But Luka Doncic IS a star. If you&rsquo;re a Celtic fan you &ldquo;fear&rdquo; this man. If you are just a casual viewer you admire this man&rsquo;s game as soon as you see it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a great Finals.</p>

      <label for="l71mkab" class="commentText"><p>I have a genuine question as a casual fan.</p>

<p>What does Porzingis bring that the Mavs have yet to face in the series against the Thunder and Timberwolves?</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe he&rsquo;s a big enough x-factor. I think he&rsquo;d be around the same level of defense as the likes of Chet and KAT while also stretching the floor on offense in a similar way. (I don&rsquo;t really know if that&rsquo;s an apt comparison.)</p>

<p>On the flip side, I don&rsquo;t think the Mavs have faced the same level of scoring threat that the Celtics bring with their full lineup.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;m really excited to see how everything turns out. It feels like such a good matchup.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s also very fast. There&rsquo;s clips of him blocking a shot, his teammates getting the rebound and then they throw a long pass to Porzingis on the other side to dunk it. Looked so fast it was like there was two of him in that clip! Lol</p>

      <label for="l711xfi" class="commentText"><p>Boston has the deeper team but Dallas is going to win the series. I&rsquo;m hearing all of the same reasons why the Mavs wouldn&rsquo;t beat the Wolves, Thunder or Clips just repackaged to fit the Celtics.</p>

<p>The way Kidd manages the minutes of Luka/Kyrie and Gafford/Lively has been great. People can talk about Boston&rsquo;s depth all they want but Luka and/or Kyrie will be on the court for 95% of the game. Maxi will get some minutes but the rotation of Lively/Gafford has been dominant.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll have the dominant defense and sprinkled in offense from PJ and DJJ who are rarely both off the floor at the same time. And when the Mavs do decide to run another lineup guys like Hardy have used their minutes effectively.</p>

<p>There will be stretches when Boston sits their stars. Just like LA, Minnesota and OKC. Dallas exploits that. Who does Boston have that is going to matchup all game against Gafford/Lively? We have two legitimate starters at center, Boston&rsquo;s depth won&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>Also weren&rsquo;t OKC and Minnesota deep teams too? Wasn&rsquo;t Minnesota this epic defensive team? It&rsquo;s funny how Dallas overcame those narratives.</p>

And they really hope they don&rsquo;t have to give meaningful minutes to players beyond those eight&ndash;Kornet is very matchup-dependent and the Mavericks aren&rsquo;t a favorable matchup, and most of the other players are non-entities on offense, which is a big problem against a Mavericks team that wants an easy matchup for Luka so he can save energy for offense and a non-shooter for the bigs so they can live in the paint. Boston&rsquo;s &ldquo;depth&rdquo; is its 3-5, and while KP will probably be on limited minutes White and Holiday will also be playing most of the game. (And I think getting 25-30 minutes out of KP is huge, but more isn&rsquo;t that important&ndash;they just need 96 minutes from Tatum/KP/Horford to avoid weird super-small lineups or turning to Kornet/Tillman. Their backcourt rotation is good enough that barring injury they don&rsquo;t need Tatum taking up SF minutes.)</p>

<p>Minnesota was an epic defensive team but a bottom-half-of-the-league offensive team, and the results show that. They only gave up 120 points once and held Dallas below 110 points <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> games&ndash;but never exceeded 110 points themselves. And that&rsquo;s despite not matching up all that well against Dallas&ndash;their perimeter defense depth and size isn&rsquo;t great (especially given that relying excessively on Edwards on the defensive end further compromises their offense), and they rely on Gobert&rsquo;s help defense which was largely neutralized by Dallas&rsquo;s lob threats. Boston&rsquo;s defense isn&rsquo;t as good overall, but IMO it matches up better&ndash;they have five good-to-great perimeter defenders, three of whom can match Luka&rsquo;s size, and aren&rsquo;t as reliant on help defense.</p>

<p>Boston&rsquo;s center rotation is KP/Horford&ndash;about as close to &ldquo;two legitimate starters at center&rdquo; as any team in the league has. (Horford was a starter last year and early this year before moving to the bench so Tatum could move to 4, not because his play was inadequate. He&rsquo;s struggled a bit in the playoffs because with KP out he&rsquo;s playing more minutes than he should at his age, but a long rest and KP coming back should change that.)</p>

<p>Boston &ldquo;resting its stars&rdquo; means you merely have three of Holiday/White/Brown/Tatum playing rather than all four&ndash;I&rsquo;m not really sure why you think that&rsquo;s an exploitable opportunity. Boston will have 3-4 good perimeter defenders and 3-4 players capable of easily scoring 20+ on the court at all times.</p>

      <label for="l70ytul" class="commentText"><p>feels like a legit coin flip honestly. Boston is probably the more complete team, but Luka and Kyrie is an incredibly difficult combo to overcome if they’re clicking. Kyrie has already shown he’s great in clutch spots, and Luka has shown the same (albeit in lower leverage situations.)</p>

      <label for="l70k092" class="commentText"><p>I honestly think the series will be decided by how the Celtics shoot this series. The Mavs have a very strong interior defense and Luka and Kyrie are going to get their points on the other side of the court.</p>

<p>The Celtics are very reliant on making their 3&rsquo;s and if the Mavs manage to limit their shooters then Celtics will be in real trouble.</p>

<p>However, full homer, Celtics in 5</p>

      <label for="l72khvn" class="commentText"><p>Boston&rsquo;s biggest defense against lob threats is that it has a plethora of elite perimeter defenders and isn&rsquo;t as reliant on help defense as Minnesota/OKC, especially against teams with multiple elite threats. From what I&rsquo;ve seen of the Mavericks they don&rsquo;t seem to actually be throwing many contested lobs, instead waiting for the opposing big to cheat off their man to help contain penetration. Boston has the depth and size on the perimeter to be less reliant on help defense than most teams, which probably means fewer lob opportunities. I think the Celtics&rsquo; gameplan will be to let Luka+Kyrie put up 60-70 on good efficiency against largely single coverage while betting that the rest of the Mav&rsquo;s roster can&rsquo;t put up the 40-50 points they need to without easy shots off doubles and hard help.</p>

      <label for="l72pztq" class="commentText"><p>I think Boston&rsquo;s hope is that all their rotation backcourt players except Hauser are genuine triple threats. Minnesota and OKC ran more heliocentric offenses, with weak shooters (Giddey and Anderson) and players with limited off-the-dribble creation (Dort, NAW) getting meaningful minutes; this let the Mavericks put their perimeter stoppers on the opposing creators while giving Luka and Kyrie relatively easy marks unless the offense burned shot clock to get more favorable matchups. While Kyrie and Luka are quite capable of handling Holiday and White isos, the combination of shooting ability and off-the-dribble creation open a lot of opportunities for the Celtics that Minnesota and OKC&rsquo;s role players didn&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>One action I think we&rsquo;ll see a lot of is the Tatum/Holiday inverse screen. In the past Boston has mainly used inverse screens fairly passively to try to switch Tatum and Smart&rsquo;s defenders, but Holiday&rsquo;s superior shooting and decision-making make it a dangerous scoring action in its own right. A straight switch puts Tatum in motion against a single, smaller defender, which usually collapses the defense and gives up an open 3. Drop coverage gives either Tatum or Holiday an open three, depending on how Tatum&rsquo;s defender handles the screen. A blitz gives Tatum a fairly easy lob over what are usually two shorter defenders, and Holiday has a variety of options for making the defense pay in a 4-on-3.</p>

<p>And while Holiday and White need a significant mismatch to make isos efficient, both can run the pick-and-pop with KP very well. KP doesn&rsquo;t often post up bigs, but he&rsquo;s extremely good at exploiting smaller defenders (he&rsquo;s the most efficient high-volume post scorer in the league by a wide margin). This means that you don&rsquo;t want to switch (or pre-switch) screens involving him, and Holiday, White, and KP are all too good shooters for safe drop coverage.</p>

      <label for="l7060g9" class="commentText"><p>Celtics should win on talent <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> starters are better.  Luka&amp;gt;Tatum&amp;gt; Brown&amp;gt;Kyrie&amp;gt;Rest of celtics&amp;gt;Rest of mavs.</p>

<p>Funnier if Celtics lose so go Mavs.</p>
