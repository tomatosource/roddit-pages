      <label for="l8gxdwo" class="commentText"><p>lol I know this hindsight bias but did people actually think Dallas was going to win? Or did you just hope that Dallas was going to win. Feels like extremely wishful thinking  Like this team won 64 games had a net rating over 11. An all time great team like this should have been massive favorites in any poll or betting odds.  Like I wanted Dallas to win but I always felt the Celtics would win easily. They check all the boxes, great on offense great on defense, two stars who can play both ends, great role players, battle tested in the playoffs. I think Laker fans skewed the results personally.</p>

      <label for="l8hahtu" class="commentText"><p>For me it was a little bit of both. I did really want Boston to lose, plus who doesn&rsquo;t love an underdog story? But I definitely got a lot of things dead wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>I thought the coaching matchup would be more even, but Kidd has been awful and Mazzula is coaching circles around him. That timeout in the middle of his team&rsquo;s run, the bad challenges, too many minutes for THJ and Kleber. I knew the Mavs were leaning on Luka and Kyrie heavily, but I didn&rsquo;t realize the extent to which they were masking Kidd&rsquo;s ineptitude.</li>
<li>I thought having the best player would be a greater advantage for the Mavs than it has been. I expected a lot more than I should have out of Luka in terms of leadership ability, and I drastically underestimated how much of a defensive liability he is. I was thinking along the lines of the 2016 Cavs, who used the best player in basketball and Kyrie Irving to take down a record-breaking, all-time great team. Or even last year&rsquo;s Heat with Playoff Jimmy taking over. But Luka ain&rsquo;t prime LBJ, and Jason Kidd ain&rsquo;t Erik Spoelstra.</li>
<li>I bought into the narrative that the Celtics are prone to choking. TBH I don&rsquo;t think that one was terribly off the mark. They came dangerously close to blowing a 21-point 4th quarter lead last night, and if Luka hadn&rsquo;t succumbed to his frustration and fouled out with 4 minutes left, I think this series is 2-1 right now.</li>

      <label for="l8hjsgi" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at the Mavs sub and there&rsquo;s a lot of honest reflection on exactly these points.</p>

<p>Except the last one, because I don&rsquo;t think we really even know what &ldquo;choking&rdquo; means with the C&rsquo;s anymore since about half of the western conference subs said the Celtics almost losing a few close games to the Pacers was a &ldquo;choke&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Taking a home game from the Warriors in Game 1 of the 2022 Finals and then giving up in pathetic fashion in 6 games was a choke. Going down 3-0 to the Heat in 2023 ECF was a choke; and laying down and letting Miami have their way with them in game 7 was a choke.</p>

<p>A very talented team having a good 4th quarter run in the NBA finals while they&rsquo;re facing certain elimination isn&rsquo;t a choke. Letting go of the rope like that is definitely a fuckup and as a Celtics fan I wanted to shoot myself, but it&rsquo;s a common enough thing that happens in almost every playoff series. At this point the &ldquo;choker&rdquo; narrative essentially just means the Celtics are not 100% perfect, and are forced to handle adversity?</p>

<p>Personally I hope NBA teams and their fans keep convincing themselves that conspicuous lapses mean the Celtics are chokers. It will make those series easier to close out</p>

      <label for="l8ha44s" class="commentText"><p>They ignored how (1) Boston has been manhandling Luka as a defender, with Jaylen just abusing him in their first meeting this season and (2) thought they could hide Luka on defense against the Celtics the way they did against Minnesota. It was laughable watching Luka down low in zone getting away with doing nothing against the Wolves. That was clearly not going to work against the Cs. I think people also forgot that The Celtics have been able to coast for much of the season due to their crazy offense and ended up underestimating the C’s defense, partly due to Indiana keeping games competitive.</p>

<p>The other big thing is a double standard people had due to Celtics fatigue. They kept mentioning Boston’s past as reasons to doubt, but only considered Dallas’s performance since the mid-season trade. Funny thing is, Boston has had a better record since that trade, but people were fixated on their narratives.</p>

      <label for="l8h13sb" class="commentText"><p>NBA reddit also does not understand that seeding in the NBA practically determines everything. IIRC only two teams have ever won a championship below a 3 seed.</p>

<p>Even more fun fact: the NBA season is “solved” by about game 40. Go see who the top 2 seeds are in each conference at game 40. Something like 80% of the time, one of those four teams is your finals champion.</p>

<p>If you think a 5 seed is winning a championship, you don’t understand the NBA at all.</p>

Coming out and saying &ldquo;Boston will win&rdquo; is the boring narrative, and of course people have to be contrarian, hence all the Mavs support. This is also why a majority of ESPN analysts picked Celtics.</p>

      <label for="l8gfnna" class="commentText"><p>Ive been saying since March, everywhere I went online to all those that I came across, that the Celtics would win the chip this year.</p>

<p>I got laughed out wherever I went. Made out for a noob that dont know basketball or some troll. Especially the Denver fans were nasty to me, it seemed like they were bandwagon. </p>

<p>If your opinion wasnt popular, you werent welcome.</p>

<p>Then the pieces started falling in place. One by one. Game by game. Teams started losing; others, started winning. First they got to the brink of elimination, and then were eliminated. The only difference was how long it took. </p>

<p>The one CONSTANT in all of this, was that the Celtics kept winning, staying alive, and advancing. </p>

<p>Once Denver lost the series, the bandwagon fans and trolls never came back. I wanted to have a word or two with them, but they were literally NOWHERE to be found 🤣.</p>

<p>Goes to show, reality always kicks the ass of social media and popular opinion. </p>

      <label for="l8gd5a8" class="commentText"><p>This is not an argument you have to make, and really shouldn&rsquo;t. Argue about Tatum or something. But just look at the stats&ndash; like it or not the C&rsquo;s have had an historic season. No reasonable person is going to agree with you that &ldquo;nobody respects it&rdquo;.</p>

<p>They set records for most 50pt wins (3), 40pt wins (4), 30pt wins (10), and those are just for show. They also had the best offensive rating of any team since &lsquo;97, highest net rating since 2000, the largest margin of victory, tied highest ever EFG% in the NBA, the most points in franchise history, the most threes in a season in franchise history and second all time in the NBA, second best defensive rating in the league, etc. etc.</p>

<p>And  yeah, they played injured teams during the playoffs WHILE THEIR OWN 20+PPG CENTER WAS OUT INJURED for the entire playoffs and now half the finals.</p>

<p>The refs have absolutely nothing to do with who&rsquo;s winning these games. For every missed call on the Mavs, you&rsquo;ll find a missed call on the C&rsquo;s. Playoff basketball. The C&rsquo;s are just better. It happens.</p>

Cool regular season records&hellip; against weak EC teams too. You play WC teams half as much as you play your own conference.. if you didn&rsquo;t know that. Didn&rsquo;t even play the best teams in the east because they were also injured (bucks, sixers) and couldn&rsquo;t make it to the ECFs. Western conference play-in teams would literally be 4th and 5th seed in the east. It&rsquo;s no different from LeBrons cakewalk runs in the East. The fact Celtics needed Porzingis and Jrue to even make some noise is just sad. WC is just built different. Who the fuck trades a player like Jrue holiday to an in conference rival? #injuryring #asterisk</p>

<p>Every championship team has luck in their title run. Wasn&rsquo;t the whole logic around the Celtics &ldquo;easy East&rdquo; was that they were going to get destroyed by the Mavericks? Wasnt the assumption the Mavs would be up 3-1 before Boston &ldquo;woke up&rdquo;?</p>

<p>The &ldquo;East is weak&rdquo; story died with the Mavs now down 0-3. If the West was so much better than the East, how come the best of the East is mopping the floor with the best of the West? Or are you going to say that the Mavs don&rsquo;t deserve to be here either because they had a too easy road for playing the Clippers down Kahwai, A Not-Ready OKC, and a gassed Timberwolves?</p>

<p>Kinda like the 2004 Sox - they swept the World Series but the &ldquo;real world series&rdquo; was the ALCS against the Yankees.</p>

<p>You cant mix metaphors like that and sound anything other than triggered. Celtics were the dominant team all season. You dont have to like them, you can even hate them, but to say they werent the best team in the league for the 2023-2024 season is a nephew take if I&rsquo;ve ever seen one.</p>

      <label for="l8glzaj" class="commentText"><p>You do realize that the Nuggets last year had one of the easiest paths to the Finals as well, right?</p>

<p>Does anyone say the Nuggets chip is an asterisk? No one is going to think of it as an asterisk season in a few years. It&rsquo;s only going to be remembered as one of the top 10 single season performances by a team in NBA history.</p>

People like you were saying this exact stuff and how the Mavs would trounce us. Are the Mavs not a real team? Was their run fake too? Didn&rsquo;t think so. 18 rings and have fun in Cancun. Also just so yk the C&rsquo;s fans love to hear the hate when we win. Makes it so much sweeter.</p>

<p>By the way, we&rsquo;ve played 2 out of 17 games with our starting lineup. Injuries have affected every single team this post season</p>

The Celtics had a better record vs. the East than the Mavs did. The Celtics had a better record post trade deadline than the Mavs. The Celtics had a better post-season record than the Mavs. The Celtics had not troubkle with the Mavs in the regular season. There was literally NO REASON to think the Mavs would win the series. The Mavs may still win the series but that will be a surprise just as any series win by the Mavs should have come as a surprise.</p>

<li>Celtics are better than Mavs  2. Mavs are better at being clutch as we saw in every game they played they were down by 10-20 points but still came back  3. Celtics aren’t really clutch cause they blew by every single time in every team  4. Mavs are really good at defense and because of Gafford and pj they get more blocks because of gafford and pj is actually hitting 3’s during the playoffs  I say Mavs but barely in game 7</li>

<p>Your take&rsquo;s conclusion was &ldquo;Mavs in 4.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In what world is the Mavs being down 0-3 an instance in which it&rsquo;s &ldquo;holding up well?&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l8fgtf2" class="commentText"><p>Luka is a traffic cone defender and a complete bag of dicks when he isn&rsquo;t getting the whistle. You dont know ball if you are watching his inefficient offense and dogshit defense and still think he&rsquo;s better.</p>

<p>The same fucking thing can be said for Jaylen over Kyrie. Defense matters and only dumb motherfuckers hunt out Tatum or Brown on defense and doing the same to the two dopes you think are the best players in this series leads to great offense.</p>

      <label for="l7ccfn7" class="commentText"><p>As great as the Celtics are, this is the Mavs championship to lose imo. Luka has finally got great defense and solid role players to work with. Not to mention Kyrie, whose just as equally great at closing games as Luka. This year they finally know how to play off of each other and the surrounding players fit them to a tee. Jason Kidd is getting better as a coach also. Ex. He no longer plays defensive liability players such as Tim Hardaway Jr and Dwight Powell no matter how much he loves em as in years past. They have all the makings to win it.</p>

<p>Tatum and Brown would have to totally outplay Luka and Kyrie if they were to win, and I just don&rsquo;t see that happening imo. Why?.. Cuz Luka and Kyrie makes the entire team better as opposed to Tatum and Brown, who tend to primarily get their own numbers to achieve greatness. It&rsquo;s just the way they play.</p>

<p>celtics don’t have any player you can sag off of, meaning the mavs bigs Will have to come to perimeter loosening their rim protection.</p>

<p>also, I can’t overlook the talent disparity. DJJ, PJ, and gafford are starters for Dallas and would be the 7th-9th men in BOS</p>

<p>Luka will be Luka but just feels like the matchup and talent favors bostkn</p>

The regular season&rsquo;s No. 1 seed has the highest odds of winning in the playoffs. I will leave you to analyse the rest for yourself buddy.</p>

      <label for="l7c3lwi" class="commentText"><p>To be truthful, I haven’t really payed all that much attention to either teams this post season. Not a fan of either teams, but I’m still surprised that the Celtics seem to be down on this much. I don’t think the Mavs are that great (wasn’t a big believer in OKC, but the way they handled the wolves does give me pause….). Still, I think this is Boston’s to lose (I do think this roster is better than their last finals appearance). Boston in 6.</p>
