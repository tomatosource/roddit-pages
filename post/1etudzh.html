</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now that the Olympics are behind us, it&rsquo;s time to look ahead to the 2024-25 season.</p>

<p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to preview each team (grouped by <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake" target="_blank">tiers</a> ). In terms of predictions, we&rsquo;re going to avoid hot takes or bold predictions for the sake of drama and simply go with the most realistic outcome. The truth of the matter is: the biggest differentiator between expected success and results tends to be injury related, so it&rsquo;s difficult to peer into the crystal ball on that front. We&rsquo;re also going to balance every team&rsquo;s wins to be an even .500 across the league, which is something most outlets don&rsquo;t bother to do.</p>

<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s cast a look at the pecking order in the <strong>WESTERN CONFERENCE.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>TIER ONE: CREAM OF THE CROP</strong></p>

<p><strong>(1) OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>57-25</strong>, +7.4 point differential, # 1 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 3rd on offense, 4th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: The Thunder were generally healthy last season, most notably with 82 games from Chet Holmgren. In an average year, you&rsquo;d expect slightly more injuries so perhaps <strong>56 wins</strong> may have been a more expected outcome.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: PG Josh Giddey, SF Gordon Hayward</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: PG Alex Caruso, C Isaiah Hartenstein, PG Nikola Topic &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no tiptoeing around it or taking baby steps anymore &ndash; the Oklahoma City are in it to win it. The team already had the # 4 overall defense &ndash; and they added strength to that strength with Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein. They&rsquo;re going to compete with the Boston Celtics for the best defense in the NBA. They&rsquo;ll be the odds-on favorite for the top seed out West.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s any concern going forward, it&rsquo;s whether or not a big body like Isaiah Hartenstein will hurt their &ldquo;five out&rdquo; style of offense. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander thrived with spacing, attacking from the midrange and the FT line, so if his efficiency takes a slight dip then it could hurt his MVP campaign.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how coach Mark Daigneault handles the rotation &ndash; specifically the starting and closing lineup. OKC has at least 6 starting-worthy players (SGA, Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren, Lu Dort, Caruso, Hartenstein) and may have a 7th in second-year guard <strong>Cason Wallace</strong>. Wallace had an excellent rookie season, shooting 49.1% from the field, 41.9% from 3, and playing tough competitive defense. That type of production is rare for a rookie &ndash; especially a one-and-done rookie like Wallace. If he can take a step up from here, the rich will get richer.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>Simply put, this team is stacked. It goes beyond an MVP candidate &ndash; it goes beyond <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> good starters &ndash; it even extends to their bench with playable wings like Kenrich Williams, Aaron Wiggins, Isaiah Joe, etc. Pushing for the # 1 seed and a <strong>57-25</strong> record seems like a realistic outcome. They certainly have the potential to win 60+ but in my scenario they&rsquo;ll be cruising to that top spot and not push the pedal to the metal.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The Thunder are listed at 56.5, second highest in the NBA behind Boston and a very fair line. And in betting, a fair line means <strong>stay away.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(2) MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>56-26</strong>, +6.5 point differential, # 3 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 16th on offense, 1st on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: The T-Wolves&rsquo; 56 wins were impressive, but they could have gotten even more if Karl-Anthony Towns didn&rsquo;t miss 20 games. Their own shooting may have been a little hotter than expected though (with Mike Conley and Nickel Alexander-Walker both hitting at a career-high clip), so maybe <strong>56 wins</strong> was a realistic outcome after all.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: PF Kyle Anderson, PG Monte Morris, PG Jordan McLaughlin</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: PG Rob Dillingham &reg;, SF Joe Ingles, SG Terrence Shannon Jr. &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Minnesota largely kept the same team in tact aside from a major gamble to move up in the draft to select Rob Dillingham. Dillingham&rsquo;s a dynamic playmaker and shotmaker whom coach John Calipari compared to Allen Iverson. (Darius Garland may be a more realistic end point.) But the trouble is: Dillingham&rsquo;s only 165 pounds and only 2 years removed from high school. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see whether coach Chris Finch is going to throw him into the trenches early on or whether he keeps him on ice for a while. If Dillingham can provide an immediate spark, it&rsquo;d certainly help an offense that was mid pack.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>Rob Dillingham will be the biggest boom/bust player in the long term, but maybe we should keep expectations in check for a teenager who may be a sieve on defense. And if Dillingham doesn&rsquo;t play much right away, the team&rsquo;s short-term success could be affected by the success of <strong>Nickeil Alexander-Walker</strong> (Shai&rsquo;s cousin). At 6&rsquo;5&rdquo;, he&rsquo;s been more advanced as a defender than initiator or shot maker so far. But with Monte Morris and Jordan McLaughlin gone, the team may need more from him offensively off the bench.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have star talent &ndash; they have decent depth &ndash; they have a good coaching staff. They&rsquo;re still title contenders. In terms of the regular season, it may be a bumpier road than last year depending on how they treat Rob Dillingham. If they force-feed him minutes too early, there may be some short-term hit. A <strong>53-29</strong> record may be in order.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The T-Wolves are listed at 52.5 on most sites. If you&rsquo;re a big Anthony Edwards optimistic you can bet the over, but I&rsquo;d be inlined to <strong>stay away.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(3) DENVER NUGGETS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>57-25</strong>, +5.3 point differential, # 2 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 5th on offense, 8th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: Outside of Jamal Murray, the Denver Nuggets were healthy last year: with Nikola Jokic playing 79 games, KCP 76, Aaron Gordon 73, and Michael Porter Jr. 81 (!). All in all, that&rsquo;s better than expected, so <strong>55 or 56 wins</strong> may have been a more realistic outcome if they suffered normal injury results.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SG Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, SF Justin Holiday, PG Reggie Jackson</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: PG Russell Westbrook, PF Dario Saric</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing that the Nuggets were mostly healthy last year, because their depth was the biggest question mark. That&rsquo;ll be even more pronounced now than ever after losing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. This season will be all about whether or not their young kids &ndash; Christian Braun, Peyton Watson, Julian Strawther &ndash; can step up to fill that gap and keep the team in title contention.</p>

<p>Of course, Russell Westbrook is the biggest name and will garner the most attention. I&rsquo;m not in love with the fit here &ndash; and I fear Mike Malone will over-play him &ndash; but if they only use him as a Reggie Jackson replacement then the signing makes more sense. Hopefully that&rsquo;s their plan and the signing isn&rsquo;t a longer-term concern about Jamal Murray&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>Among the young wings, <strong>Julian Strawther</strong> may be the best fit for the starting/closing lineup from a skill set perspective. Christian Braun and Peyton Watson have more aspects to their game, but Strawther may be a more seamless fit as a blend-in 5th starter and 3+D wing. Is he ready for that role? Based on last season, probably not. Based on Summer League, probably so. After all, he&rsquo;s an older sophomore after spending 3 seasons at Gonzaga. If he can step in and be <em>average</em>, that&rsquo;d be a huge boost for the team&rsquo;s chances.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>Fans and pundits are going to be down on Denver this year because of the KCP news and concerns about the depth, but that may be an overreaction. Presuming Nikola Jokic stays healthy, <strong>51-30</strong> should be a realistic result. If Jokic could carry the &lsquo;21-22 team to 48 wins, he can do anything. Of course, if he misses 15+ games, then all bets are off.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The Nuggets are listed at 51.5, so another <strong>stay away</strong> (promise I didn&rsquo;t consult these lines until after making picks. Vegas just uses similar metrics.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(4) DALLAS MAVERICKS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>50-32</strong>, +2.3 point differential, # 5 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 10th on offense, 18th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: Based on their record and advanced stats, the Dallas Mavericks may have been closer to a 48-win team. However, that represents a full season of results, not the quality of the roster by the end of the year. After the trade for P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford, the team took a marked step up. They finished the season on a 16-4 tear &ndash; which would translate to a 65-win pace. Realistically, <strong>53 wins</strong> may represent a good compromise between the two numbers.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SF Derrick Jones Jr., SG Josh Green, SG Tim Hardaway Jr.</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SG Klay Thompson, SF Naji Marshall, SG Quentin Grimes</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Last season, Luka Doncic averaged 33.9 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 9.8 assists &ndash; and did NOT win MVP. That may finally change this year. Klay Thompson isn&rsquo;t the man he used to be, but he&rsquo;s still a more reliable shooter than Tim Hardaway Jr. and may help Luka get over that nice round 30-10-10 number.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>Clearly, the midseason trades helped out quite a bit. That said, I&rsquo;m not 100% sold no the idea that <strong>P.J. Washington</strong> was a huge improvement on Grant Williams. Washington looks the part of a stretch 4 that checks all the boxes, but you can argue that he&rsquo;s more of a Mr. Mediocrity (average across all categories). He&rsquo;s an average shooter, average rebounder, etc. He looked red hot in the playoffs, but still only shot 34.8% from deep (after going 32.0% in the regular season). If he&rsquo;s an actual 3rd/4th option, then this team could contend for the 1 seed. If he&rsquo;s someone who will always leave you wanting more, then maybe this team gets stuck in the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> range again.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not inclined to overreact to the playoff success, because this roster still looks like a <strong>51-31</strong> team to me. Luka Doncic can&rsquo;t play much better than he did either, so if they improve it&rsquo;ll have to be stronger two-way play from the supporting cast.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>Some sites have the Mavericks are 50.5, but you can find them at 49.5 on others. Even in a tough conference, I&rsquo;d <strong>bet a little on that OVER</strong> with faith in Luka Doncic and the team&rsquo;s momentum. It&rsquo;s a slight tout though &ndash; and there are better ones on the board.</p>

      <label for="lifqyl2" class="commentText"><p>good write up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d just like to add Strawther was dealing with injuries to his ankle and knee for most of his rookie season so it was very difficult for him to establish a rhythm offensively.  his bballref page is definitely underselling what he&rsquo;s capable of. I&rsquo;m expecting a &ldquo;woah, where did this guy come from&rdquo; flurry for his sophmore campaign.</p>
