</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>First of all, Kareem is obviously the best player career wise and peak wise if we do it that way.</p>

<p>But we are doing a comparison based on the 80s decade where Kareem won his 6th MVP in 1980, and then never won again. Kareem was an Old Man in the 80s. 70s is where Kareem&rsquo;s prime coincide.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, in 80s decade, Kareem still won MVP and multiple First team appearance. He even won a FMVP in his old age this decade.</p>

<p>However, 2 younger in their prime Centers emerged. Moses and Hakeem.</p>

<p>Moses won back to back MVPs and a FMVP in a 4 years stretch. Early 80s to be exact.</p>

<p>However Mid 80s, Hakeem panned out.  Heck he lead the Rockets to a Finals appearance against Bird&rsquo;s Celtics. And Hakeem was  a sophomore only back then!</p>

<p>Who do you think should be crowned as the best Center in 80s?</p>

<p>Kareem, Hakeem, or Moses???</p>

That Portland team alone would&rsquo;ve been crazy. His skillset/athleticism in his early 20s was pretty scary for that era. Not very far from what Wemby is today. Minus the dribbling I guess.</p>

<p>Except Sabonis was also just fucking gigantic, had like 4 inches on Jokic.</p>

<p>But alien anyway, both of them. Huge dudes who can move very well for their size and pass to anywhere and are disturbing as hell even just standing there like a big central tower ready to deliver the ball with accuracy absolutely anywhere, or just score on their own anyway.</p>

<p>There have been plenty of big stiffs in basketball history, bigs who really were basically statues. I would definitely not describe young Arvydas Sabonis or Jokic like that at all. Sabonis was basically that when he entered the NBA but by then he was old and his legs were destroyed, and he was still effective.</p>

<p>Olajuwon had NOBODY in the 1980s&ndash;he was the guy carrying the team. Moses started the decade in Houston, but quickly went to a STACKED Philly team with Dr. J, Mo Cheeks, Andrew Toney (whom nobody remembers but he was a two-time All-Star) and, for his last year there, Charles Barkley. He had a great decade, but also had at least two HOFers on all of his Philly teams (Erving, Cheeks, and Barkley).</p>

<p>Again, of the three, I&rsquo;m still picking pre-H Olajuwon, because he kept Houston relevant despite a truly awful roster in the 80s</p>

      <label for="ln7a9sw" class="commentText"><p>Unpopular opinion but I think in most situations both Kareem and Hakeem provide more value than Moses. Issue is Kareem fell off as the 80’s went on, so it depends if we are talking the whole decade or if you narrow it down to a couple of years. Same for Hakeem as he was only drafted halfway through. There is little doubt that for the whole decade Malone is the answer for that alone even if he also faded out of his prime after 85 or so.</p>

<p>Moses game was so dependent on the offensive glass. It’s not that it doesn’t have value but he wasn’t providing the same offensive boost that his raw “points per game” would suggest. Most bigs who score at that rate are doing it more within the offense, they get the ball, draw help, and then kick to open space which creates advantages for teammates and ball movement and open shots.</p>

<p>Malone is sorta the opposite. Not saying he never did that, but it was much less so than you would expect from a top tier big scoring at the rate he did. It’s weird because offensive rebounding and being able to score and generate free throw attempts has value anywhere, but at the same time because he wasn’t providing the typical offensive value as other high scoring bigs his arrival to all his different teams didn’t really push massively better upgrades like you would assume his raw numbers would suggest. And while his arrival in Philly instantly resulted in a ring this was a team that had already made two finals without him. They needed him to be better than Jones to push them over the top, and he easily provided that.</p>

<p>I’ve already commented this in another thread but to illustrate how “rare” of an offensive player Moses was only 16 times in league history has a player averaged 20+ pp/75 and 15+ ORB%.. Malone is half of those season. The only other player to do it more than one time is Enas Kanter (3 times). If you sort those 16 years by scoring he’s actually the most Malone-like of anybody ever. Bump the points to 22+ instead of 20+ and Malone and Kanter are the only two players in NBA history to hit that mark.. Kanter was a lower minute role player, so take the actual stat with a grain of salt, but I’m just using that to illustrate how much unlike everyone else Moses truly was. Most great scoring bigs do not rack up a ton of offensive boards because typically good scorers make their shots at high percentages, and if you’re the one shooting rarely does the ball bounce right back to you anyways.</p>

<p>I guess my point is on a replacement level team I think the boost Kareem and Hakeem add to both a team offense and team defense likely has more value. I feel like on a team that struggles offensively and defensively Malone isn’t going to raise the floor all that much. I’d rather have Kareem in the first couple years of the 80’s and Hakeem in the last few, Malone was likely better over the course of the whole decade.</p>

<p>There is also value in being able to “fit” anywhere. He instantly went to Philly and won largely because he also wasn’t taking anything away from anybody else. You’ll never win rings on bad teams so being able to fit next to other talent is a premium.</p>

<p>He also got the best of Kareem twice in the playoffs so maybe ignore everything I said and call me dumb lol.</p>

      <label for="ln7neha" class="commentText"><p>It’s Kareem. Hakeem didn’t peak until the 90s and had he not won those rings would be brought up with the Trailblazers are being failures who skipped over Jordan. Choke city was what the rockets were known as until the 90s. And are still known as that now…</p>

<p>Moses has kind of a shot, but not really. Kareem was part of the lakers dynasty even in his advanced age. He also should have DPOYs but that didn’t exist until 83.</p>
