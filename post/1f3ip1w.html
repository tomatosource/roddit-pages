      <p>It&rsquo;s crazy to me that despite being one of the best athletes ever, having a great jump shot, and in general being very skilled, VC only ever made two All NBA teams and never made one after his 3rd season. I feel like he didnt maximize the potential he had as a superstar</p>

AI only took that many 3’s once (his rookie year with the short line) and Kobe didn’t take that many per game until Shaq left.</p>

Stockton only made two All-NBA First Teams but that’s largely because MJ always occupied a spot at guard. Stockton happened to make First Team twice, and by magical coincidence both seasons were when MJ retired in the mid-90s, freeing up that guard spot.</p>

<p>VC had a murderers’ row of All-NBA competition.  You can’t look at these things in a vacuum.</p>

      <label for="lkex5qo" class="commentText"><blockquote>
<p>Name the “murderers row” of guards that kept Vince out of All NBA. Particularly from 2002-2004</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vince Carter was injured and missed significant chunks of the season in both 2002 and 2003 (60 and 43 games, respectively). He didn&rsquo;t finish either of those seasons and was often battling chronic conditions when he was on the floor.</p>

<p>2004 was just a meh season for Vince, where I thought maybe he&rsquo;d permanently lost a couple steps. He ended up getting his groove back a year later but 2004 was always a wash. No murderers row was keeping him off of anything that year.</p>

<p>Murderers Row may be strong in 2005, 2006 and 2007 but the field was indeed pretty crowded. A sampling:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kobe Bryant, Chauncey Billups, Dwyane Wade, Gilbert Arenas, Steve Nash, Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Jason Kidd, Tony Parker, Michael Redd, Manu Ginobili, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, and Richard Hamilton.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vince&rsquo;s best shot from a performance standpoint during that era probably would have been his 2005 season with the Nets. Unfortunately, he spent the first portion of that season sabotaging the Raptors so there was no chance he was getting rewarded, which was entirely his own doing.</p>

      <label for="lkeerad" class="commentText"><p>Even Steph “only” has 4 First Team selections, same as Chris Paul, just one more than Jayson Tatum has. CP3 is considered one of the best PGs to ever do it and Steph is genuinely transformational.</p>

<p>How could Steph have made 4 Second Teams and 2 Third teams, he’s competing with Magic and his 9 First Team selections no? “Must be a scrub to have all those players make it ahead of him” - idiot kids like you guys 20 years from now.</p>

<p>Weirdly enough, these things don’t tell the full story.</p>

<p>Yes, all-NBA first team can be particularly hard to get into (Embiid was the runner up MVP twice and didn&rsquo;t make first team for obvious reasons), but it Vince didn&rsquo;t make <em>any</em> team after his 3rd season.</p>

      <label for="lkegmqw" class="commentText"><p>Calling people idiot kids because you can’t maintain a civil conversation is silly. Get a hold of yourself. Stick to your “LeBron isn’t a PF but Michael Jordan is a SF” conversations if need be.</p>

<p>No one said you can’t contextualize things.</p>

<p>But when your contextualization is “these other good players existed”, it’s insufficient. We know who Mark Price is, we know who Penny Hardaway is. Why wasn’t Stockton better in that regular season, though?</p>

<p>For Steph, he didn’t deserve it in 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024, fairly obviously. No need to cope around that as you did with Stockton. 2018 he got hurt. 2017’s the only real miss around his peak.</p>

      <label for="lkeik57" class="commentText"><p>I never made the argument that Stockton deserved it in those years, the exact opposite really, including emphasizing that MJ consistently monopolized a spot. So I have no idea why you’re bringing up Steph deserving it those years or not, it’s literally irrelevant. The exact point is that he didn’t get First Team.</p>

<p>I’m also making the argument that staring down accolades does not an argument make. Steph and CP3’s careers overlap to an extent but anyone staring down the accolades might favor CP3 who is missing the MVP but has far more significant defensive ones. But nobody questions who the better, more transformative player was.</p>

<p>Saying that Stockton only has 2 First Team selections completely ignores the context. You guys are doing the same exact thing as the idiot kid 20 years from now, that term again cause it just fits, who never watched Steph Curry play mocking his lack of All-NBA First Teams as encompassing what he was.</p>

      <label for="lkekl4q" class="commentText"><p>Let’s say you roughly ranked every first team all-NBA guard season that was ever played. So 90 MJ, 91 MJ, etc occupy different positions.</p>

<p>Do you think Mark Price and Penny Hardaway would be in the upper half of this ranking? I certainly don’t! They’re worse than essentially every all-time great guard.</p>

<p>Me? I take 2017 Westbrook and 2017 Harden over both of them.</p>

<p>That’s why, again, I said that contextualization is fine. Necessary, even. Not all first team selections are created equally. And that will get even more important to realize with it going positionless now.</p>

<p>So, no one is advocating for staring down accolades and ranking players off of that. Perhaps staring down basketball reference is how you determined that Michael Jordan should be considered a small forward, but not generally my way of going about things.</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> important is contextualizing what a first team All-NBA season is.</p>

<p>It’s very easy for people without any historical perspective to say “ah, this player just got unlucky.” when they did not.</p>

<p>Stockton was worse than Oscar and West. Stockton was worse than Magic. Stockton was worse than Jordan. Stockton was worse than Kobe. Stockton was worse than Paul. Stockton was worse than Curry and Harden. Stockton was worse than Luka.</p>

<p>In every era save for maybe the 70s, Stockton would’ve dealt with a guy who was solidly getting first teams over him. Why?</p>

<p>Because an average prime Stockton season would rank in the lower end of historical first team all nba guard seasons.</p>

<p>Or the subject of this thread? Was Vince Carter just really, super duper unlucky? No. An average prime Carter season would rank in the lower end of historical first team all nba guard seasons.</p>

<p>This is not staring down accolades. This is having some actual perspective and thinking things through.</p>

      <label for="lkeygk0" class="commentText"><p>To some degree, it was a solid mix of bad luck, bad timing, and self-inflicted wounds.</p>

<p>I have little doubt he&rsquo;d have been in the All-NBA running in 2002, 2003, and probably 2004 but he sustained season-ending injuries in both 2002 and 2003 then spent 2004 trying to claw himself back out of the hole.</p>

<p>He was absolutely an All-NBA level performer with the Nets in 2005 (averaged something like 28, 6, and 5). The catch? He spent the first portion of the season sabotaging the Raptors into dealing him for peanuts in return. Not an ideal way to harvest end-of-season award votes. But he was a killer in Jersey that year nonetheless.</p>

<p>He was an easy all-star in 2006 and 2007 but by then it&rsquo;d been established that the Nets were going to be first or second round fodder and when the All-NBA field was as crowded as it was (Kobe Bryant, Chauncey Billups, Dwyane Wade, Gilbert Arenas, Steve Nash, Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Jason Kidd, Tony Parker, Michael Redd, Manu Ginobili, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, and Richard Hamilton), Vince probably wasn&rsquo;t quite as peaked out as he was a year or few prior, so he was left on the outside looking in.</p>

<p>Under slightly different circumstances, I could see Vince being the same player he was but with three or four more All-NBA selections if health had been on his side (and if he hadn&rsquo;t given up on Toronto).</p>

For a lot of contemporaries—Tracy McGrady, Steve Francis, etc.—that was right around the time they called it quits (if not earlier).</p>

<p>As such, I always kind of respected the fact that Vince recognized that his athleticism-heavy impact on the game was evaporating yet he went ahead and leaned into that reality, reinventing himself as a role player as a means of playing almost ten more seasons of basketball, a number of which were still significantly impactful.</p>

<p>I think the detractors need to give him more credit for his transition into a long time role player. Another star like Iverson from his era simply couldn&rsquo;t do it. Hanging on for as long as he did suggests his lack of drive/will is overstated. When it&rsquo;s all said and done he&rsquo;s still a future HOFer.</p>

      <label for="lkeve9e" class="commentText"><blockquote>
<p>He was fairly banged up starting in the middle of his prime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he&rsquo;d have two or three more All-NBA selections if he didn&rsquo;t have so many injuries in 2002 and 2003 (missed the final chunk of both seasons). Then it seemed like he spent a lot of &lsquo;04 just trying to get his legs back.</p>

<p>Honestly, I guess you could probably call those injuries his big sliding doors moment. If they hadn&rsquo;t happened, his Raptors teams are probably a lot more successful in 2002 through 2004 and that very well may have prevented the Vince-front office issues from popping off to such an extreme degree in the first place, and who knows where we go from there.</p>

      <label for="lkelq8x" class="commentText"><p>The guy played 22 season in the NBA, had 8 ASG selections and had atleast 1 MVP rank vote in 4 different seasons.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t really any modern players who play 20+ seasons and were bad players. There&rsquo;s a floor to how bad a player who plays 22 seasons can be. For example, Kevin Love is going to be a borderline HOFer (73% odds according to Sports Reference) and he will not reach 20 seasons, nor did he make as many all-star games or get as many MVP vote shares.</p>

<p>I think people will remember VC&rsquo;s career as something comparable to Blake Griffin&rsquo;s career arc, but with almost double the longevity. That&rsquo;s pretty cool, but obviously not superstar.</p>

After he went to the nets they took the last playoff spot from the lebron Cavs. That team was a mess and it took VC playing at all nba level (he didn’t get it due to wade and rep at that point) to drag them to the playoffs.</p>

<p>That nets team just didn’t have the frontcourt needed to beat Shaq (even Heat Shaq). Krstic was nice on offense but you had Jason collins, mikki moore (good pnr player) and guys like Boone and yi that never panned out. It was basically Kidd VC and rj and parts and that frontcourt was never going to get them far enough.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lkeutvw" class="commentText"><p>Vince&rsquo;s All-NBA situation has always been an interesting mix of bad luck and a healthy dose of self-sabotage. A quick rundown:</p>

<p><strong>The Injury Era</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>2002: An All-NBA-worthy season until the injuries hit. His season ended after 60 games, bumping him out of the All-NBA conversation.</p></li>

<li><p>2003: Could not shake the injury bug. Was hooping when healthy but generally wasn&rsquo;t healthy. This was the peak &ldquo;Half Man, Half a Season&rdquo; era.</p></li>

<li><p>2004: Felt like a season where he was just trying to get his legs back under him after missing so many games the two seasons prior. Solid season, but clearly not classic Vince.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Self-Sabotage Era</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2005: The year he gave up on Toronto. He actually balled out in New Jersey (averaged 28, 6, and 5 in 57 games) but there was a 0.0000000 percent chance anyone was going to reward him after the stunt he pulled in Toronto. Had he been a trooper with the Raptors then was dealt due to natural causes, I think he would have had a shot at an All-NBA slot this season on his play alone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Loaded Guard Era</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2006 &amp; 2007: I think Vince Carter, in a vacuum, was an All-NBA level player in both 2006 and 2007. However, it&rsquo;s very easy to understand why he was boxed out in these particular years. Had he hooped for a great team, a championship contender, or one in which he was clearly responsible for lifting them far above their expectations, I&rsquo;m sure he could have forced his way into a selection. Instead, I think he had great seasons for meh teams that performed as expected. As a result, he got lost in the following shuffle:</li>
</ul>

<p>Kobe Bryant, Chauncey Billups, Dwyane Wade, Gilbert Arenas, Steve Nash, Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Jason Kidd, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, and Richard Hamilton.</p>

<p><strong>The Downward Trend</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2008 &amp; 2009: The run was over. He was still producing but the all-star years were through and thus, so were any All-NBA considerations. Dude was just getting old, and only had 11 years of professional basketball left.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Final Rundown</strong></p>

<p>Had Vince been healthy (or just injured at the front end of seasons instead of the tail end), I bet he could have snagged an All-NBA in &lsquo;02 and/or &lsquo;03. I imagine he also would have received much more consideration in &lsquo;05 if he hadn&rsquo;t sabotaged Toronto. He would have had led New Jersey to better seasons in &lsquo;06 and &lsquo;07 to work into that crowded field.</p>

The guy put Canada basketball on the map.  Being public enemy for losing to Philly in a game 7 probably led him to say &ldquo;F you&rdquo; towards being a star and carrying a team to chip and focus on longevity and being a vet.   I think his career is a bittersweet &ldquo;what if&rdquo;, but overrated?  Nah.  VC had generational talent.  Could&rsquo;ve truly been one of the greats.</p>
