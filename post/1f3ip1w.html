      <p>It&rsquo;s crazy to me that despite being one of the best athletes ever, having a great jump shot, and in general being very skilled, VC only ever made two All NBA teams and never made one after his 3rd season. I feel like he didnt maximize the potential he had as a superstar</p>

      <label for="lke29a9" class="commentText"><p>I just had this conversation with some dope in another thread but people never take into account competition. Stockton only made two All-NBA First Teams but that‚Äôs largely because MJ always occupied a spot at guard. Stockton happened to make First Team twice, and by magical coincidence both seasons were when MJ retired in the mid-90s, freeing up that guard spot.</p>

<p>VC had a murderers‚Äô row of All-NBA competition.  You can‚Äôt look at these things in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Guys like Baron Davis, Stephon Marbury, Michael Redd and Sam Cassell were making All NBA in those years lmao</p>

<p>The truth is VC was just not as good as his hype would lead you to believe</p>

After he went to the nets they took the last playoff spot from the lebron Cavs. That team was a mess and it took VC playing at all nba level (he didn‚Äôt get it due to wade and rep at that point) to drag them to the playoffs.</p>

<p>That nets team just didn‚Äôt have the frontcourt needed to beat Shaq (even Heat Shaq). Krstic was nice on offense but you had Jason collins, mikki moore (good pnr player) and guys like Boone and yi that never panned out. It was basically Kidd VC and rj and parts and that frontcourt was never going to get them far enough.</p>

<sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.2 on 45/38/80 shooting in an era where scoring was harder/less of it. I think he did pretty well. He was the 7th best scorer during that time frame.</p>

      <label for="lke6aq3" class="commentText"><p>When the Toronto fanbase gave him shit for attending his UNC graduation during the playoffs and subsequent loss to the 76ers, was beginning of the end of superstar VC.  The guy put Canada basketball on the map.  Being public enemy for losing to Philly in a game 7 probably led him to say &ldquo;F you&rdquo; towards being a star and carrying a team to chip and focus on longevity and being a vet.   I think his career is a bittersweet &ldquo;what if&rdquo;, but overrated?  Nah.  VC had generational talent.  Could&rsquo;ve truly been one of the greats.</p>

      <label for="lkef60l" class="commentText"><p>For the first 3 years, Carter was must see TV., Toronto won and he showed all the tools of an elite player.  To Add&hellip;Injuries, Toronto mismanagement and fan backlash (some deserved for quitting&hellip;but giving him shit for attending his college graduation was still fucked up). In general he didn&rsquo;t have MJ or Kobe&rsquo;s mental makeup.  At his height, talent wise he had all the tools.    Again, more what if than overrated.</p>
