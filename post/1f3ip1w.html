      <label for="lke29a9" class="commentText"><p>I just had this conversation with some dope in another thread but people never take into account competition. Stockton only made two All-NBA First Teams but that‚Äôs largely because MJ always occupied a spot at guard. Stockton happened to make First Team twice, and by magical coincidence both seasons were when MJ retired in the mid-90s, freeing up that guard spot.</p>

<p>VC had a murderers‚Äô row of All-NBA competition.  You can‚Äôt look at these things in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Yes, all-NBA first team can be particularly hard to get into (Embiid was the runner up MVP twice and didn&rsquo;t make first team for obvious reasons), but it Vince didn&rsquo;t make <em>any</em> team after his 3rd season.</p>

<p>No one said you can‚Äôt contextualize things.</p>

<p>But when your contextualization is ‚Äúthese other good players existed‚Äù, it‚Äôs insufficient. We know who Mark Price is, we know who Penny Hardaway is. Why wasn‚Äôt Stockton better in that regular season, though?</p>

<p>For Steph, he didn‚Äôt deserve it in 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024, fairly obviously. No need to cope around that as you did with Stockton. 2018 he got hurt. 2017‚Äôs the only real miss around his peak.</p>

      <label for="lkeik57" class="commentText"><p>I never made the argument that Stockton deserved it in those years, the exact opposite really, including emphasizing that MJ consistently monopolized a spot. So I have no idea why you‚Äôre bringing up Steph deserving it those years or not, it‚Äôs literally irrelevant. The exact point is that he didn‚Äôt get First Team.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also making the argument that staring down accolades does not an argument make. Steph and CP3‚Äôs careers overlap to an extent but anyone staring down the accolades might favor CP3 who is missing the MVP but has far more significant defensive ones. But nobody questions who the better, more transformative player was.</p>

<p>Saying that Stockton only has 2 First Team selections completely ignores the context. You guys are doing the same exact thing as the idiot kid 20 years from now, that term again cause it just fits, who never watched Steph Curry play mocking his lack of All-NBA First Teams as encompassing what he was.</p>

      <label for="lkekl4q" class="commentText"><p>Let‚Äôs say you roughly ranked every first team all-NBA guard season that was ever played. So 90 MJ, 91 MJ, etc occupy different positions.</p>

<p>Do you think Mark Price and Penny Hardaway would be in the upper half of this ranking? I certainly don‚Äôt! They‚Äôre worse than essentially every all-time great guard.</p>

<p>Me? I take 2017 Westbrook and 2017 Harden over both of them.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why, again, I said that contextualization is fine. Necessary, even. Not all first team selections are created equally. And that will get even more important to realize with it going positionless now.</p>

<p>So, no one is advocating for staring down accolades and ranking players off of that. Perhaps staring down basketball reference is how you determined that Michael Jordan should be considered a small forward, but not generally my way of going about things.</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> important is contextualizing what a first team All-NBA season is.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs very easy for people without any historical perspective to say ‚Äúah, this player just got unlucky.‚Äù when they did not.</p>

<p>Stockton was worse than Oscar and West. Stockton was worse than Magic. Stockton was worse than Jordan. Stockton was worse than Kobe. Stockton was worse than Paul. Stockton was worse than Curry and Harden. Stockton was worse than Luka.</p>

<p>In every era save for maybe the 70s, Stockton would‚Äôve dealt with a guy who was solidly getting first teams over him. Why?</p>

<p>Because an average prime Stockton season would rank in the lower end of historical first team all nba guard seasons.</p>

<p>Or the subject of this thread? Was Vince Carter just really, super duper unlucky? No. An average prime Carter season would rank in the lower end of historical first team all nba guard seasons.</p>

<p>This is not staring down accolades. This is having some actual perspective and thinking things through.</p>

Vince did none of that apart from the 3, which he picked up fairly early on because he was just so talented.  No improvement on handling, footwork, post game, playmaking.  Dude just coasted on raw talent.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t really any modern players who play 20+ seasons and were bad players. There&rsquo;s a floor to how bad a player who plays 22 seasons can be. For example, Kevin Love is going to be a borderline HOFer (73% odds according to Sports Reference) and he will not reach 20 seasons, nor did he make as many all-star games or get as many MVP vote shares.</p>

<p>I think people will remember VC&rsquo;s career as something comparable to Blake Griffin&rsquo;s career arc, but with almost double the longevity. That&rsquo;s pretty cool, but obviously not superstar.</p>

After he went to the nets they took the last playoff spot from the lebron Cavs. That team was a mess and it took VC playing at all nba level (he didn‚Äôt get it due to wade and rep at that point) to drag them to the playoffs.</p>

<p>That nets team just didn‚Äôt have the frontcourt needed to beat Shaq (even Heat Shaq). Krstic was nice on offense but you had Jason collins, mikki moore (good pnr player) and guys like Boone and yi that never panned out. It was basically Kidd VC and rj and parts and that frontcourt was never going to get them far enough.</p>

Settled more for midrange jumpers as a result. If he was coming up today a lot of those long 2s would be 3s giving him a boost in efficiency.</p>

<p>I think the detractors need to give him more credit for his transition into a long time role player. Another star like Iverson from his era simply couldn&rsquo;t do it. Hanging on for as long as he did suggests his lack of drive/will is overstated. When it&rsquo;s all said and done he&rsquo;s still a future HOFer.</p>

The guy put Canada basketball on the map.  Being public enemy for losing to Philly in a game 7 probably led him to say &ldquo;F you&rdquo; towards being a star and carrying a team to chip and focus on longevity and being a vet.   I think his career is a bittersweet &ldquo;what if&rdquo;, but overrated?  Nah.  VC had generational talent.  Could&rsquo;ve truly been one of the greats.</p>

      <label for="lkef60l" class="commentText"><p>For the first 3 years, Carter was must see TV., Toronto won and he showed all the tools of an elite player.  To Add&hellip;Injuries, Toronto mismanagement and fan backlash (some deserved for quitting&hellip;but giving him shit for attending his college graduation was still fucked up). In general he didn&rsquo;t have MJ or Kobe&rsquo;s mental makeup.  At his height, talent wise he had all the tools.    Again, more what if than overrated.</p>
