      <label for="llxzuoz" class="commentText"><p>Why I never buy the narrative that Russell wouldn’t be good in today’s game. Being 6’10(which he’d probably be listed at 6’11 today since they were measured barefoot) doesn’t matter when he had a great wingspan and some of the craziest jumps I’ve ever seen. Russell was such a defensive force even compared to someone like Wilt who was great in his own right on that end.</p>

<p>Anyone who hasn’t at least seen 60’s highlights needs to see what Wilt and Russell were capable of. They would still be freak athletes today</p>

      <label for="llyhurq" class="commentText"><p>That line of thinking is daft. Russell would go first overall in any draft today, he’d get picked ahead of Wemby.</p>

<p>You’re talking about a 6’10 player with a 7’4 wingspan who has sprinter speed and is second-ranked high jumper <em>in the nation,</em> seventh in the entire world. On top of that, he’s got the stamina to play 44 minutes a night without break. Half the league would tank just to get a guy with that athletic profile.</p>

<p>Throw on top of that, he’s got the highest bball IQ anyone has ever seen, he’s the best defensive player in the world, and a born leader. He’s coming off multiple titles in college for a nothing school. Throw in the fact that he’s got advanced handle and passing abilities for a big man as a bonus.</p>

<p>Watching Russell highlights, his athleticism stands out so impressively that it’s hard to imagine a team today <em>not</em> taking more advantage, whether using him on cuts or lobs or pick-and-rolls or letting him bring the ball up more or switching until he could dunk on some guard, etc. The game was primitive back then and his skills were not fully harnessed.</p>

      <label for="llyire1" class="commentText"><p>Russell was famous for his basketball IQ (and he was a remarkably intelligent man in general — a leader in the civil rights movement outside of basketball). His book and interviews for decades reflect this. Over and over he explains in detail how he operated and the psychology he employed on the court. He also describes observing his teams to identify their shortcomings and then taking it upon himself to fill those shortcomings, he relays a deep understanding of his teammates’s abilities and mentalities, etc. One obvious example is he was made a player-coach and led his team to two titles. So, merely as a coach, he has the same accolades as luminaries like Erik Spoelstra and Chuck Daly, only he was also playing 40 minutes a night while coaching the team.</p>

But the sports have changed in popularity over time.  For the last 25ish years (if not longer) every 14 year old kid who MAYBE has the potential to make it to the NBA gets funneled into basketball, at the exclusion of all else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s dozens of NBA players that would be capable of winning Olympic golds.  But there&rsquo;s plenty that could&rsquo;ve absolutely torched the competition at every high school track meet, and been college greats as well.</p>

      <label for="llxuxui" class="commentText"><p>He was an otherworldly athlete, the best in NBA history. His <a href="https://youtu.be/QF8yJ1J1W7Q?si=5tGGHiJQCadgeG3U" target="_blank">vertical lift</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/jGvZWqf8OY4?si=z1mg6ogw3v1oMLDx" target="_blank">speed</a> were absolutely insane.</p>

<p>Offensively, he was largely a post-up guy. It probably would’ve been better for his versatility and efficiency if he opted for more transition scoring - much like Bill Russell did - but his halfcourt game, while slow and mechanical, was still very effective.</p>

<p>His scoring mostly consisted of <a href="https://youtu.be/8O9MgNfcGJA?si=OPnTkPit_cCn2aMq" target="_blank">mid-range fadeaways</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/t9cUpYe6G10?si=exePuzJY1iYQ_8V0" target="_blank">finger rolls,</a> both of which were some of the most unstoppable moves in the history of the game. Wilt was a finesse player - remember that initiating contact on offense was illegal in this era of basketball, so he couldn’t play like Shaq despite his similar strength and size.</p>

<p>Defensively, he was a behemoth. All-time great rim intimidation, the most prolific rebounder ever, exceptional shot-blocker, and incredible man defense due to his power and physical tolerance. The only thing he lacked compared to a Bill Russell or Nate Thurmond was the ability to switch to perimeter players, but that wasn’t very important in his era. And for what it’s worth, he was good at it in a limited sample size - he just didn’t like to.</p>

<p>He was kind of in his “prime” at all times, since he was consistently a top 1-5 player in pretty much every season of his career. His absolute peak was from ‘66 to ‘68 with the 76ers, where he was given a proper supporting cast and could tone down his shot attempts to utilize his great post playmaking.</p>

<p>Philly made 3 straight Eastern Division Finals <em>(ECFs)</em>, won a championship, and won 60+ games twice in the Chamberlain era. The ‘67 76ers are a top 10, maybe even top 5, team of all-time.</p>

      <label for="llxvom3" class="commentText"><p>1967 Wilt was one of the most efficient scorers ever, one of the greatest bigman passers ever and one of the best defenders ever. The 76 won 68 games that year which was most all time, ended the 8 year Boston dynasty (in only 5 games) and won the title. </p>

<p>I think Wilt might&rsquo;ve had the highest peak ever, but he didnt peak when he scored 50 PPG. </p>

      <label for="lly10ag" class="commentText"><p>Highest Peak by which metrics?</p>

<p>We have limited advanced stats data about Wilts time. </p>

<p>Basically just WS, WS/48, and PER.</p>

<p>In his 7 Peak years he had:</p>

<p>PER: 29.8; WS: 141.4; WS/48: .266</p>

<p>Lets compare these to the Likes of Jordan+Lebron.</p>

<p>Regular season/ playoffs </p>

<p>         Wilt:                 Jordan:           Lebron:</p>

<p>PER: 29.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.5.      30.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub>.8       30.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.8</p>

<p>WS: 141.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>.1     132.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.9     119.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.4</p>

<p>WS/48: .266/.255  .285/.264      .283/.261</p>

<p>Points/g per 36 minutes:</p>

<p>Wilt: 30.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.9</p>

<p>Jordan: 30.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub>.9</p>

<p>Lebron: 26.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.3</p>

<p>Wilts 50.4 ppg season is a 40.5 pp100 season. </p>

<p>Lets look at Jordan and James per 100 in their 7 year Peak:</p>

<p>Jordan: 42.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>44</sub>.2</p>

<p>Lebron: 38.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>37</sub>.1</p>

<p>Lebrons 7 year Peak average nearly matches Wilts best season. </p>

<p>Jordan straight up had a higher pp100 average over 7 years than Wilt achieved in his best season. </p>

<p>A thing Wilt accomplished that will never get broken: scoring 4k points in a single season. And playing 48.5 minutes per game in a season. For his Peak 7 Wilt played 47 minutes/g. Absurd!</p>

      <label for="lly7afr" class="commentText"><p>My last sentence implies that. </p>

<p>But the matter of fact is also his numbers are highly inflated by that 130+ pace he played in. </p>

<p>His playoff average is just 32.8 ppg on 47.5 minutes, a steep drop from his 39.6 regular season average on 47 minutes.</p>

<p>Jordan averaged 33.2 ppg on 39.2 minutes. And 34.7ppg on 41.7 minutes in the playoffs. </p>

<p>Playoff Jordan outscored playoff Wilt by 1.9 ppg despite playing 5.8 less minutes. </p>

<p>Playoff Lebron (28.1) was only outscored by playoff Wilt by 4.7 ppg while Wilt played 5.7 more minutes.</p>

<p>Its something else to increase your scoring average when the competition gets tough, than having a 6.8 ppg drop. </p>

<p>Some stat geeks tracked a few Games. If I remember correctly:</p>

<p>Wilt: 8.9 blkpg </p>

<p>Russell: 8.1 blkpg </p>

<p>Absurd numbers.</p>

<p>I wouldnt be suprised if Wilts <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> season also featured 10 blocks&hellip;</p>

<p>Same for Russell:</p>

<p>Nobody would doubt his standing as the best defensive Center ever with averages of 15/22/4/2/8</p>

      <label for="lly88ej" class="commentText"><p>This post lead me to ask my dad, who did go see Wilt in LA play and watched him on TV in Philly what he thought. He thought overall, Wilt was the most talented player but not as good as a team player as Kareem, who was the best center he ever saw except maybe Walton on the Blazers (his all time that he saw live for comparison, in order of seeing them play, is Magic, Bird, Jordan, and LeBron, with (not in any real order) Kareem, Walton, Wilt, Shaq, Dr. J, Brandon Roy, and Ralph Sampson for hitting that one shot as runners up). Wilt&rsquo;s defense inside would still be huge and he was fast for his size so you couldn&rsquo;t easily play him off the floor. Add to that, he had a kind of scoring game that is more useful in tough playoff situations when it&rsquo;s hard to get good shots, and you have a really good player, even in today&rsquo;s NBA. The key, probably, is to do what the Lakers ended up doing, which was have more of the offense go through West and let Wilt clean up on offense and put more energy into defense. In the modern NBA, you could use him as a distribution hub with good passing and let him shut down easy interior scoring while pairing him with high scoring wings. His size and passing still means a team would have to watch out for him around the basket no matter what</p>

      <label for="llyf6wf" class="commentText"><p>First of all, you have to understand what an absolute freakshow of an athlete he was, even by modern standards. Even if you eliminate the most egregious bullshit stories about him, you’re still talking about a guy who was 7’1, between 255 and 310 pounds during his playing career, probably around 275 pounds at his peak, who was a collegiate-level sprinter and high jumper and had the stamina to play every minute of every game. He had a 7’8 wingspan, which is one of the longest ever, and there’s some reliable info that he had a vertical leap in the 36-40-inch range. His strength was legendary, with Arnold Schwarzenegger even marveling at his power.</p>

<p>There have been a handful of athletes in the past 100 years who reach a level where their athletic abilities defy what should be possible given the rules of their game, and Wilt was one of those. He could dunk from the free throw line by taking just three steps. There is footage of him blocking Kareem’s famously unblockable skyhook. Make no mistake, if you take every player in history at the beginning of their career and put them into a draft at the same time, Wilt goes first overall without much debate or consideration. He would be the obvious, consensus choice.</p>

<p>It’s really tough to even imagine this level of athleticism. Picture if Joel Embiid had a much, much stronger twin brother who could also run as fast and jump as high as Ja Morant, and was so well-conditioned that he literally never came off the court. That is essentially Wilt’s athletic profile.</p>

<p>What’s more, Wilt was not just some brute. He was a smart player who was an excellent defender, passer, and rebounded, and who adapted his game over time. He had the athleticism and basketball IQ to do anything.</p>

<p>He was also, somewhat understandably, an egomaniac and headcase who was traded multiple times in his career for next to nothing and often fell short in championship runs. He obsessed over his own stats to the detriment of his teams’ success. His stats are otherworldly, but they do mask a lack of team success all the way back to Kansas, and you need to look at that aspect of his career just as closely as the 100-point game. The point is to win, and Wilt simply didn’t know how to win the way some of the other truly great players did. He did evolve as a player, but notably, his teams started having success once he started emulating Bill Russell and focused less on scoring and more on defense and rebounding. Despite the well-earned criticisms of his team play, he not only won two rings, but the 1967 Warriors and 1972 Lakers were the two best teams ever at that time, and are still good candidates today for “best team ever” status.</p>

<p>All-in-all, you have a guy who is on the short list of the most athletic people of the 21st century, and, despite deserved criticisms, is still a guy who went to the conference finals often, won two rings, and led two legendary teams. Quite the legacy.</p>

Old school rims/backboards weren&rsquo;t equipped to handle powerful dunks, so big guys probably got a lot more practice doing things like finger rolls than current players who are coached to throw it down with authority.</p>
