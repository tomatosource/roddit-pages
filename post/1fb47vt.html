      <label for="llxzuoz" class="commentText"><p>Why I never buy the narrative that Russell wouldn’t be good in today’s game. Being 6’10(which he’d probably be listed at 6’11 today since they were measured barefoot) doesn’t matter when he had a great wingspan and some of the craziest jumps I’ve ever seen. Russell was such a defensive force even compared to someone like Wilt who was great in his own right on that end.</p>

<p>Anyone who hasn’t at least seen 60’s highlights needs to see what Wilt and Russell were capable of. They would still be freak athletes today</p>

      <label for="lly9z8z" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, I think there&rsquo;s probably quite a few guys in today&rsquo;s NBA who would be track and field stars, if they opted to go that route.  But the sports have changed in popularity over time.  For the last 25ish years (if not longer) every 14 year old kid who MAYBE has the potential to make it to the NBA gets funneled into basketball, at the exclusion of all else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s dozens of NBA players that would be capable of winning Olympic golds.  But there&rsquo;s plenty that could&rsquo;ve absolutely torched the competition at every high school track meet, and been college greats as well.</p>

      <label for="llxuxui" class="commentText"><p>He was an otherworldly athlete, the best in NBA history. His <a href="https://youtu.be/QF8yJ1J1W7Q?si=5tGGHiJQCadgeG3U" target="_blank">vertical lift</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/jGvZWqf8OY4?si=z1mg6ogw3v1oMLDx" target="_blank">speed</a> were absolutely insane.</p>

<p>Offensively, he was largely a post-up guy. It probably would’ve been better for his versatility and efficiency if he opted for more transition scoring - much like Bill Russell did - but his halfcourt game, while slow and mechanical, was still very effective.</p>

<p>His scoring mostly consisted of <a href="https://youtu.be/8O9MgNfcGJA?si=OPnTkPit_cCn2aMq" target="_blank">mid-range fadeaways</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/t9cUpYe6G10?si=exePuzJY1iYQ_8V0" target="_blank">finger rolls,</a> both of which were some of the most unstoppable moves in the history of the game. Wilt was a finesse player - remember that initiating contact on offense was illegal in this era of basketball, so he couldn’t play like Shaq despite his similar strength and size.</p>

<p>Defensively, he was a behemoth. All-time great rim intimidation, the most prolific rebounder ever, exceptional shot-blocker, and incredible man defense due to his power and physical tolerance. The only thing he lacked compared to a Bill Russell or Nate Thurmond was the ability to switch to perimeter players, but that wasn’t very important in his era. And for what it’s worth, he was good at it in a limited sample size - he just didn’t like to.</p>

<p>He was kind of in his “prime” at all times, since he was consistently a top 1-5 player in pretty much every season of his career. His absolute peak was from ‘66 to ‘68 with the 76ers, where he was given a proper supporting cast and could tone down his shot attempts to utilize his great post playmaking.</p>

<p>Philly made 3 straight Eastern Division Finals <em>(ECFs)</em>, won a championship, and won 60+ games twice in the Chamberlain era. The ‘67 76ers are a top 10, maybe even top 5, team of all-time.</p>

      <label for="llxvom3" class="commentText"><p>1967 Wilt was one of the most efficient scorers ever, one of the greatest bigman passers ever and one of the best defenders ever. The 76 won 68 games that year which was most all time, ended the 8 year Boston dynasty (in only 5 games) and won the title. </p>

<p>I think Wilt might&rsquo;ve had the highest peak ever, but he didnt peak when he scored 50 PPG. </p>

      <label for="lly10ag" class="commentText"><p>Highest Peak by which metrics?</p>

<p>We have limited advanced stats data about Wilts time. </p>

<p>Basically just WS, WS/48, and PER.</p>

<p>In his 7 Peak years he had:</p>

<p>PER: 29.8; WS: 141.4; WS/48: .266</p>

<p>Lets compare these to the Likes of Jordan+Lebron.</p>

<p>Regular season/ playoffs </p>

<p>         Wilt:                 Jordan:           Lebron:</p>

<p>PER: 29.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.5.      30.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub>.8       30.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.8</p>

<p>WS: 141.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>.1     132.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.9     119.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.4</p>

<p>WS/48: .266/.255  .285/.264      .283/.261</p>

<p>Points/g per 36 minutes:</p>

<p>Wilt: 30.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.9</p>

<p>Jordan: 30.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub>.9</p>

<p>Lebron: 26.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.3</p>

<p>Wilts 50.4 ppg season is a 40.5 pp100 season. </p>

<p>Lets look at Jordan and James per 100 in their 7 year Peak:</p>

<p>Jordan: 42.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>44</sub>.2</p>

<p>Lebron: 38.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>37</sub>.1</p>

<p>Lebrons 7 year Peak average nearly matches Wilts best season. </p>

<p>Jordan straight up had a higher pp100 average over 7 years than Wilt achieved in his best season. </p>

<p>A thing Wilt accomplished that will never get broken: scoring 4k points in a single season. And playing 48.5 minutes per game in a season. For his Peak 7 Wilt played 47 minutes/g. Absurd!</p>

      <label for="lly7afr" class="commentText"><p>My last sentence implies that. </p>

<p>But the matter of fact is also his numbers are highly inflated by that 130+ pace he played in. </p>

<p>His playoff average is just 32.8 ppg on 47.5 minutes, a steep drop from his 39.6 regular season average on 47 minutes.</p>

<p>Jordan averaged 33.2 ppg on 39.2 minutes. And 34.7ppg on 41.7 minutes in the playoffs. </p>

<p>Playoff Jordan outscored playoff Wilt by 1.9 ppg despite playing 5.8 less minutes. </p>

<p>Playoff Lebron (28.1) was only outscored by playoff Wilt by 4.7 ppg while Wilt played 5.7 more minutes.</p>

<p>Its something else to increase your scoring average when the competition gets tough, than having a 6.8 ppg drop. </p>

      <label for="llxstjh" class="commentText"><p>Random thought that I have no evidence for: I bet the &ldquo;no dunking&rdquo; rules at many gyms has a lot to do with that. Old school rims/backboards weren&rsquo;t equipped to handle powerful dunks, so big guys probably got a lot more practice doing things like finger rolls than current players who are coached to throw it down with authority.</p>

      <label for="lly88ej" class="commentText"><p>This post lead me to ask my dad, who did go see Wilt in LA play and watched him on TV in Philly what he thought. He thought overall, Wilt was the most talented player but not as good as a team player as Kareem, who was the best center he ever saw except maybe Walton on the Blazers (his all time that he saw live for comparison, in order of seeing them play, is Magic, Bird, Jordan, and LeBron, with (not in any real order) Kareem, Walton, Wilt, Shaq, Dr. J, Brandon Roy, and Ralph Sampson for hitting that one shot as runners up). Wilt&rsquo;s defense inside would still be huge and he was fast for his size so you couldn&rsquo;t easily play him off the floor. Add to that, he had a kind of scoring game that is more useful in tough playoff situations when it&rsquo;s hard to get good shots, and you have a really good player, even in today&rsquo;s NBA. The key, probably, is to do what the Lakers ended up doing, which was have more of the offense go through West and let Wilt clean up on offense and put more energy into defense. In the modern NBA, you could use him as a distribution hub with good passing and let him shut down easy interior scoring while pairing him with high scoring wings. His size and passing still means a team would have to watch out for him around the basket no matter what</p>

<p>The man played almost every minute of every game in his entire career, even in his last season at 37 years old, 100 points in one game, averaged 50 points per game in one season.</p>

<p>8 of his seasons were 30+ average points, with 2 being above 44+ and 1 being 50.</p>

<p>Before 67 I don&rsquo;t think he was anything special, those high scoring seasons actively made his teams offense worse. Post 67 i think he is a better scoring worse passing bill walton with longevity.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think he can crack the very highest echelon because the his skillet although impressive wasn&rsquo;t the best way to win in that era.</p>
