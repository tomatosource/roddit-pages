      <label for="llxzuoz" class="commentText"><p>Why I never buy the narrative that Russell wouldn’t be good in today’s game. Being 6’10(which he’d probably be listed at 6’11 today since they were measured barefoot) doesn’t matter when he had a great wingspan and some of the craziest jumps I’ve ever seen. Russell was such a defensive force even compared to someone like Wilt who was great in his own right on that end.</p>

<p>Anyone who hasn’t at least seen 60’s highlights needs to see what Wilt and Russell were capable of. They would still be freak athletes today</p>

      <label for="llyhurq" class="commentText"><p>That line of thinking is daft. Russell would go first overall in any draft today, he’d get picked ahead of Wemby.</p>

<p>You’re talking about a 6’10 player with a 7’4 wingspan who has sprinter speed and is the second-ranked high jumper <em>in the nation,</em> seventh in the entire world. On top of that, he’s got the stamina to play 44 minutes a night. Half the league would tank just to get a guy with that athletic profile.</p>

<p>Throw on top of that, he’s got the highest bball IQ anyone has ever seen, he’s the best defensive player in the world, and a born leader. He’s coming off multiple titles in college for a nothing school. And he’s got advanced handle and passing abilities for a big man as a bonus.</p>

<p>Watching Russell highlights, his athleticism stands out so impressively that it’s hard to imagine a team today <em>not</em> taking more advantage, whether using him on cuts or lobs or pick-and-rolls or letting him bring the ball up more or switching until he could dunk on some guard, etc. The game was primitive back then and his skills were not fully harnessed.</p>

      <label for="llzmraz" class="commentText"><p>I knew a guy (friend&rsquo;s dad) who played against Russell and guarded him. He said he was the best he ever saw, by far, and talked about his ridiculous stamina and how high he jumped, just crazy hops and could do it all night.</p>

<p>He said the thing that impressed him the most, and that only guys who got on a court with Russell knew and talked about was how freakishly strong he was. Said Bill Russell could pretty much break your arm going up for a ball on any play and both of you knew it and playing him disrespectful in any way was not an option because he would stop holding back against you if you pushed him too far.</p>

      <label for="lm2kkai" class="commentText"><p>Controversial opinion but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be picked ahead of a LeBron/Wemby/Shaq level pick. He played in an era where sports were less specialized so him being an elite basketball player and high level track athlete would be impossible today.  His b-ball IQ isn&rsquo;t the highest of all time IMO and he played in an era where the best athletes weren&rsquo;t going into basketball- NBA/ABA were losing talented athletes to   baseball or football. Lebron grew up in poverty and was windmilling at 15 without any specialized training- the pool of athletes focusing on the NBA got a lot better once everyone wanted to be &ldquo;like Mike&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="llz00da" class="commentText"><p>Let&rsquo;s add to this: If Rudy Gobert could play, Russell would absolutely be great in this era. I don&rsquo;t think any of us have to worry about him on the defensive end.
That said, he was a very good offensive player, and one could argue he might be better on offense than defense. At least Russell said that about himself. He did average 20 PPG in college after all.</p>

<p>He was also a very good passer and was one of the main guys on those Celtics teams that initiated the offense after grabbing the rebound and throwing the outlet pass on fast breaks.</p>

<p>One last point, and I know this can potentially rub people the wrong way here, but here it goes. The NBA back then was very different than what it is now. Back then, the NBA had quotas on how many Black players could be on a team. There were also multiple reports where teams didn&rsquo;t want Black players scoring too much or dominating the game. I do feel that some of that could be why Russell didn&rsquo;t have the big offensive numbers as Cousy, Sharman, and others.
The Celtics were whipping everyone&rsquo;s asses anyways, so it&rsquo;s not like they needed Russell to score 30 a night. But I&rsquo;m saying all of this to say that it&rsquo;s something to think about when discussing Russell&rsquo;s greatness.</p>

<p>Players today complain about what people say about them on social media. Imagine what Russell was dealing with in the 60s</p>

Anyone saying he wouldn&rsquo;t succeed today is kidding themselves.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to compare eras, but given access to today&rsquo;s training, coaching, shoes, and sports medicine, he would be a great asset for any team to have.</p>

      <label for="lly9z8z" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, I think there&rsquo;s probably quite a few guys in today&rsquo;s NBA who would be track and field stars, if they opted to go that route.  But the sports have changed in popularity over time.  For the last 25ish years (if not longer) every 14 year old kid who MAYBE has the potential to make it to the NBA gets funneled into basketball, at the exclusion of all else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s dozens of NBA players that would be capable of winning Olympic golds.  But there&rsquo;s plenty that could&rsquo;ve absolutely torched the competition at every high school track meet, and been college greats as well.</p>

<p>Media criticized Wilt for being “selfish” to score so much.</p>

<p>Wilt then cut his FGA attempts in half, shot 68%, and averaged over 7 assists.</p>

<p>He once refused to shoot the ball in a game, 0-0 FG, 18 TRB, 13 assists.</p>

<p>He had a 20/20/20 game.</p>

<p>Chamberlain was worried about injuring defenders when he dunked, so he started his famous finder role instead.</p>

<p>Chamberlain was a freak athlete, extremely skilled, and smart.  He would dominate any era.</p>

<p>When I watch his highlights he looks like he&rsquo;s an incredibly physically dominant, incredibly athletic, and smart player whose skills are kind of below average even for his era. He would always kind of watch the ball when he dribbled and it looked a little awkward. And he shot below 50% on free throws for his career. Good passer though.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="llxuxui" class="commentText"><p>He was an otherworldly athlete, the best in NBA history. His <a href="https://youtu.be/QF8yJ1J1W7Q?si=5tGGHiJQCadgeG3U" target="_blank">vertical lift</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/jGvZWqf8OY4?si=z1mg6ogw3v1oMLDx" target="_blank">speed</a> were absolutely insane.</p>

<p>Offensively, he was largely a post-up guy. It probably would’ve been better for his versatility and efficiency if he opted for more transition scoring - much like Bill Russell did - but his halfcourt game, while slow and mechanical, was still very effective.</p>

<p>His scoring mostly consisted of <a href="https://youtu.be/8O9MgNfcGJA?si=OPnTkPit_cCn2aMq" target="_blank">mid-range fadeaways</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/t9cUpYe6G10?si=exePuzJY1iYQ_8V0" target="_blank">finger rolls,</a> both of which were some of the most unstoppable moves in the history of the game. Wilt was a finesse player - remember that initiating contact on offense was illegal in this era of basketball, so he couldn’t play like Shaq despite his similar strength and size.</p>

<p>Defensively, he was a behemoth. All-time great rim intimidation, the most prolific rebounder ever, exceptional shot-blocker, and incredible man defense due to his power and physical tolerance. The only thing he lacked compared to a Bill Russell or Nate Thurmond was the ability to switch to perimeter players, but that wasn’t very important in his era. And for what it’s worth, he was good at it in a limited sample size - he just didn’t like to.</p>

<p>He was kind of in his “prime” at all times, since he was consistently a top 1-5 player in pretty much every season of his career. His absolute peak was from ‘66 to ‘68 with the 76ers, where he was given a proper supporting cast and could tone down his shot attempts to utilize his great post playmaking.</p>

<p>Philly made 3 straight Eastern Division Finals <em>(ECFs)</em>, won a championship, and won 60+ games twice in the Chamberlain era. The ‘67 76ers are a top 10, maybe even top 5, team of all-time.</p>

<p>His teammates weren&rsquo;t always hot trash before Philly, he just wasn&rsquo;t a skilled or especially willing passer when he was younger. The extra space and experience in Philadelphia definitely helped though.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="llzlg6e" class="commentText"><p>It goes both ways. Wilt was definitely not as willing of a passer, but his offensive supporting cast was pretty putrid.</p>

<p>Paul Arizin and Tom Gola were great, but the latter lacked individual shot creation skills and both left after the Warriors moved to San Fran. Arizin wanted to stay in Philly with family and Gola forced a trade to New York.</p>

<p>Outside of those two, the only scorers above league average efficiency that Wilt played with are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bob McNeill</strong> in ‘62 - played 21 games, 10.1 MPG, 4.1 PPG</li>
<li><strong>Kenny Sears</strong> in ‘63 and ‘64 - played 54 / 51 games, 12.4 MPG, 4.8 PPG</li>
<li><strong>Al Attles</strong> in ‘63 and ‘64 - 10.6 PPG</li>
<li><strong>Tom Meschery</strong> in ‘64 - 13.5 PPG</li>
</ul>

<p>So a whopping four players Wilt played with were above-average shot creators, and only two played major roles on Warriors rosters - and even then, were no better than tertiary or quaternary scorers.</p>

<p>A lot of Wilt’s shot-chucking with the team was ugly, but continuously necessary to uphold the offense from historically bad levels.</p>

<p>Wilt&rsquo;s prime is 1960-66. Someone born in 1950 would be 10-16 during that run</p>

<p>And even if someone born in 1960 saw a few games in 72-73, I&rsquo;m not banking on a 12-year-old who saw Wilt&rsquo;s decline</p>

<p>I think Wilt might&rsquo;ve had the highest peak ever, but he didnt peak when he scored 50 PPG. </p>

      <label for="lly10ag" class="commentText"><p>Highest Peak by which metrics?</p>

<p>We have limited advanced stats data about Wilts time. </p>

<p>Basically just WS, WS/48, and PER.</p>

<p>In his 7 Peak years he had:</p>

<p>PER: 29.8; WS: 141.4; WS/48: .266</p>

<p>Lets compare these to the Likes of Jordan+Lebron.</p>

<p>Regular season/ playoffs </p>

<p>         Wilt:                 Jordan:           Lebron:</p>

<p>PER: 29.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.5.      30.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub>.8       30.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.8</p>

<p>WS: 141.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>.1     132.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.9     119.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.4</p>

<p>WS/48: .266/.255  .285/.264      .283/.261</p>

<p>Points/g per 36 minutes:</p>

<p>Wilt: 30.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.9</p>

<p>Jordan: 30.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub>.9</p>

<p>Lebron: 26.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.3</p>

<p>Wilts 50.4 ppg season is a 40.5 pp100 season. </p>

<p>Lets look at Jordan and James per 100 in their 7 year Peak:</p>

<p>Jordan: 42.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>44</sub>.2</p>

<p>Lebron: 38.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>37</sub>.1</p>

<p>Lebrons 7 year Peak average nearly matches Wilts best season. </p>

<p>Jordan straight up had a higher pp100 average over 7 years than Wilt achieved in his best season. </p>

<p>A thing Wilt accomplished that will never get broken: scoring 4k points in a single season. And playing 48.5 minutes per game in a season. For his Peak 7 Wilt played 47 minutes/g. Absurd!</p>

      <label for="lly7afr" class="commentText"><p>My last sentence implies that. </p>

<p>But the matter of fact is also his numbers are highly inflated by that 130+ pace he played in. </p>

<p>His playoff average is just 32.8 ppg on 47.5 minutes, a steep drop from his 39.6 regular season average on 47 minutes.</p>

<p>Jordan averaged 33.2 ppg on 39.2 minutes. And 34.7ppg on 41.7 minutes in the playoffs. </p>

<p>Playoff Jordan outscored playoff Wilt by 1.9 ppg despite playing 5.8 less minutes. </p>

<p>Playoff Lebron (28.1) was only outscored by playoff Wilt by 4.7 ppg while Wilt played 5.7 more minutes.</p>

<p>Its something else to increase your scoring average when the competition gets tough, than having a 6.8 ppg drop. </p>

<p>Russell: 8.1 blkpg </p>

<p>Absurd numbers.</p>

<p>I wouldnt be suprised if Wilts <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> season also featured 10 blocks&hellip;</p>

<p>Same for Russell:</p>

<p>Nobody would doubt his standing as the best defensive Center ever with averages of 15/22/4/2/8</p>

      <label for="llyf6wf" class="commentText"><p>First of all, you have to understand what an absolute freakshow of an athlete he was, even by modern standards. Even if you eliminate the most egregious bullshit stories about him, you’re still talking about a guy who was 7’1, between 255 and 310 pounds during his playing career, probably around 275 pounds at his peak, who was a collegiate-level sprinter and high jumper and had the stamina to play every minute of every game. He had a 7’8 wingspan, which is one of the longest ever, and there’s some reliable info that he had a vertical leap in the 36-40-inch range. His strength was legendary, with Arnold Schwarzenegger even marveling at his power.</p>

<p>There have been a handful of athletes in the past 100 years who reach a level where their athletic abilities defy what should be possible given the rules of their game, and Wilt was one of those. He could dunk from the free throw line by taking just three steps. There is footage of him blocking Kareem’s famously unblockable skyhook. Make no mistake, if you take every player in history at the beginning of their career and put them into a draft at the same time, Wilt goes first overall without much debate or consideration. He would be the obvious, consensus choice.</p>

<p>It’s really tough to even imagine this level of athleticism. Picture if Joel Embiid had a much, much stronger twin brother who could also run as fast and jump as high as Ja Morant, and was so well-conditioned that he literally never came off the court. That is essentially Wilt’s athletic profile.</p>

<p>What’s more, Wilt was not just some brute. He was a smart player who was an excellent defender, passer, and rebounder, and who adapted his game over time. He had the athleticism and basketball IQ to do anything.</p>

<p>He was also, somewhat understandably, an egomaniac and headcase who was traded multiple times in his career for next to nothing and often fell short in championship runs. He obsessed over his own stats to the detriment of his teams’ success. His stats are otherworldly, but they do mask a lack of team success all the way back to Kansas, and you need to look at that aspect of his career just as closely as the 100-point game. The point is to win, and Wilt simply didn’t know how to win the way some of the other truly great players did. He did evolve as a player, but notably, his teams started having success once he started emulating Bill Russell and focused less on scoring and more on defense and rebounding. Despite the well-earned criticisms of his team play, he not only won two rings, but the 1967 Warriors and 1972 Lakers were the two best teams ever at that time, and are still good candidates today for “best team ever” status.</p>

<p>All-in-all, you have a guy who is on the short list of the most athletic people of the 21st century, and, despite deserved criticisms, is still a guy who went to the conference finals often, won two rings, and led two legendary teams. Quite the legacy.</p>

      <label for="lly88ej" class="commentText"><p>This post lead me to ask my dad, who did go see Wilt in LA play and watched him on TV in Philly what he thought. He thought overall, Wilt was the most talented player but not as good as a team player as Kareem, who was the best center he ever saw except maybe Walton on the Blazers (his all time that he saw live for comparison, in order of seeing them play, is Magic, Bird, Jordan, and LeBron, with (not in any real order) Kareem, Walton, Wilt, Shaq, Dr. J, Brandon Roy, and Ralph Sampson for hitting that one shot as runners up). Wilt&rsquo;s defense inside would still be huge and he was fast for his size so you couldn&rsquo;t easily play him off the floor. Add to that, he had a kind of scoring game that is more useful in tough playoff situations when it&rsquo;s hard to get good shots, and you have a really good player, even in today&rsquo;s NBA. The key, probably, is to do what the Lakers ended up doing, which was have more of the offense go through West and let Wilt clean up on offense and put more energy into defense. In the modern NBA, you could use him as a distribution hub with good passing and let him shut down easy interior scoring while pairing him with high scoring wings. His size and passing still means a team would have to watch out for him around the basket no matter what</p>

      <label for="lly3qkx" class="commentText"><p>If Wilt played during Michael Jordan’s or LeBron James’s time period, he would be the undisputed greatest of all time player, and there probably wouldn’t be anyone to come close to him in the history of basketball past, present, and future.</p>

<p>The man played almost every minute of every game in his entire career, even in his last season at 37 years old, and he didn’t miss games, not during his prime, and not when he was 37 either.</p>

<p>8 of his seasons were 30+ average points, with 2 being above 44+ and 1 being 50.</p>

<p>The man was/is a basketball god/legend, I’m disappointed that I wasn’t alive to witness his game in person.</p>

<p>He holds 72 NBA records <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_career_achievements_by_Wilt_Chamberlain#:~:text=4%20External%20links-,List%20of%20records%20and%20feats,NBA%20records%2C%2068%20by%20himself." target="_blank">Wiki Article</a></p>

      <label for="llym5o6" class="commentText"><p>Wilt was, and still is, arguably the most physically dominant player ever in the NBA, possibly all of North American sports.</p>

<p>There is a reason why there are so many legendary sounding tales about him, because there’s a grain of truth in all of them.</p>

<p>When he was with the Lakers, he would go to Gold’s gym on Long Beach (iirc that’s where it was) where Arnold Schwarzenegger and many of the world’s top body builders would work out.  He would come in and do sets that blew them away.  He was incredibly strong.</p>

<p>He ran track and field in high school and college, so he was fast.</p>

<p>Remember Kareem’s Skyhook?  Only like two players have been known to be able to defend it by blocking it…Wilt and Thurmond.  Wilt could do it consistently … and remember that was at the <em>end</em> of Wilt’s career, past his prime.</p>

<p>His turnaround fadeaway jumper  is one of the most copied moves in nba history…Bernard King, Jordan, Duncan, Dirk…just to name a few, have variations on his shot.  And he could hit it from <em>anywhere</em>.</p>

Kareem was usually top 6-7 on most lists with Oscar and Baylor above him. Rings culture elevated Kareem in retro. Also Wilt died in 97 and he wasn&rsquo;t alive to keep his legacy strong. He was a very well spoken man but was a petty dude with bad takes on modern basketball at the time. He gave MJ shade when all MJ did was give him praise. Rings culture and him not being alive and involved with the NBA pushed him way down.</p>

<p>We see guys like hobbled old isiah thomas go to these bullshit games and drop 50 points like it&rsquo;s nothing against pro ams.</p>

<p>The nba back then was full of bullshit competition. It&rsquo;s just the truth and the league was very small. It was in it&rsquo;s infancy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s similiar to caitlyn clark in the wnba. Wnba isn&rsquo;t full of great players. The players make 60k a year and it&rsquo;s not a sport embraced with the masses.</p>

<p>Is caitlyn clark great? Yeah. If she grows her sport in 20 years most of that league is gonna be looked at pretty badly</p>

<p>Lakers used to televise all road games on channel 5 here.</p>

<p>I have seen him play on television and live probably a hundred times. By the time he got to LA he was on bad knees and he was a load. Not fat just massive.</p>

<p>I have never seen a center who could dominate a game or a series with defense and rebounding like Wilt could. The year the Lakers won the title they played the Bucks and Kareem in the WCF. Wilt blocked Kareem 17 times in that series. There is a good article about that series that I can&rsquo;t be bothered to look up, but in one stretch in the deciding game he blocked Kareem 5 times</p>

<p>Years later Kareem would be first team all NBA after absolutely destroying Akeem in the regular season. Kareem was 36</p>

Wilt: 10.8 / 19.3 / 3.3 (blocks unknown, thus I can&rsquo;t refute your claims) on on .452 FG% / .443 FT%.  No question Wilt was an elite defender / rim protector (probably top two all time with Russell) and one of the few who could affect Kareem&rsquo;s skyhook, but for all the blocks he may have racked up it appears to have hardly made a dent in Kareem&rsquo;s scoring (I&rsquo;ll note that it did impact his efficiency, but not as much as Nate Thurmond in the series prior, who held Kareem to .405 FG%).</p>

      <label for="llym0ea" class="commentText"><p>Just talent wise he was toe to toe with Bill Russell during their playing days. We&rsquo;re talking about a guy who went from holding 7 scoring titles to leading the league in assists one season just to prove to the world that he wasn&rsquo;t that much of a ball hog. To this day he is the only center in history to lead the league in assists.</p>

<p>The only reason people rank him lower than Bill is rings. Wilt &ldquo;only&rdquo; won two despite being head and shoulders the greatest individual talent of his generation. Of course only is in quotes because most great players would be very happy with 2 titles but it just speaks to how dominant Wilt was as a player that people expected much much more of him.</p>

      <label for="llzei4e" class="commentText"><p>The best I can liken it to was Tiger Woods&rsquo; explosion into the PGA.  Before him, it was guys in their mid 30&rsquo;s to 40&rsquo;s who typically ran the show.  Supreme skill enhanced by an amazingly honed athleticism made Woods a mega champion and changed the game to the point where the courses are arranged differently because of his influence.  Now it seems like every other major champion is a guy in his mid to late 20&rsquo;s who use their athleticism to make the ball go farther and in in amazing trajectories.</p>

<p>Wilt was that, but probably more pronounced, since he remains an all time athletic freak of nature.  He high jumped 6&rsquo;5&rdquo;;  He Long jumped 22&rsquo;;  He put the shot 53 feet;  He had a 49 second 440:  All at 7 feet tall.  The fact that he was able to translate that to basketball transformed the game into what it has become since.</p>

      <label for="lm1dq3d" class="commentText"><p>Possibly the greatest player to ever play the game of basketball. </p>

<p>Like a faster, more skilled, and maybe even stronger version of Shaq. </p>

<p>For perspective, an old Wilt played well against Kareem, who played well against Olajuwon, who played well against Shaq. We can see a clear line between these generations that shows the older guys could compete against the later players.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s difficult to directly compare eras (and kind of pointless to try), but he helped lay the foundations of the sport. One of the early superstars. Really an embodiment of the phrase &ldquo;If we have seen farther, it is because we stand on the shoulders of giants.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lm1lybo" class="commentText"><p>He was perfect for his era and was held back by by his own hubris.</p>

<p>We always talk about &lsquo;what is player from x era was transported to modern era&rsquo; and we discuss how modern medicine and training would make them better yada yada.</p>

<p>There is a reverse aspect to this as well&hellip;we notice how these older players were track athletes, volleyball players, etc. Many modern players could absolutely be skilled in these areas, but have focused on basketball for their WHOLE lives.</p>

<p>The NBA was new back then, athletes were encouraged if not required to do many different things. Basketball wasn&rsquo;t as big, a dominate force or really all that popular in comparison to other activities. Hell, Bowling paid similar money.</p>

<p>The idea is, Wilt was a phenomenal athlete, but he also trained so many different areas. We say &lsquo;well he would be great at any sport he tried&rsquo;, but neglect to mention because he trained in so many different areas. That training gives him more diverse training and skills.</p>

<p>We always get so excited when a big man trained as a guard, or a player grew up overseas and has soccer (football) skills and improvisation abilities. Imagine being forced to have that mindset your whole athletic career.</p>

<p>If Wilt was transported to the modern era, he would not have had that diverse training, and would have been involved in basketball from birth. Think about that, would he actually be better? We don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>So we can&rsquo;t really make a good comparison because the game back then was played different, they trained different and the talent distribution was different.</p>

<p>You can obviously watch footage and see his dominance and read his stats and know he was dominate physically.</p>

<p>You can also read between the lines and see he was selfish, played poor team basketball until he decided otherwise.</p>

<p>He played in an era of basketball, where he was one only a few big name stars, and could get the green light to do whatever the hell he wanted for as many minutes as he wanted. There was nobody to tell him otherwise.</p>
