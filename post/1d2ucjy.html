      <label for="l64yd81" class="commentText"><p>I really want to see the universe where he&rsquo;s never able to unload Simmons for the value he wanted, and what his image in that universe is. The universe where the Nets realize that trading Harden meant the likely disbanding of the superteam, and found out through planning ahead that they absolutely could not take on Simmons as part of any deal. Simmons&rsquo; presence handcuffed their later negotiations due to rules about acquiring multiple players on Designated Rookie Extensions. Not only were they locked out of any potential trade for the likes of KAT and Bam, they couldn&rsquo;t even pretend to be interested to leverage them in trade talks as a price anchor. I sincerely believe they just didn&rsquo;t realize the position they were putting themselves in, because even if they liked what Simmons could still potentially be, not being able to leverage other superstars in a Durant trade situation is horrible, and not a position that a competent FO would have put themselves in. Morey was completely bailed out by the Nets, and I want to see the universe where he isn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="l64r3mi" class="commentText"><p>What&rsquo;s the consensus on what actually happened in the Morey v Harden feud?</p>

<p>My reading of it is that Harden took a major discount to help the Sixers salary cap on a handshake agreement with Morey (who he was friends with) under the promise that Morey would make it up to him next year (probably a max deal?).</p>

<p>But when Harden ended up having a less than great season (and therefore was worth less than what Morey originally agreed to pay him), Morey reneged on the handshake agreement.  Leading to Harden demanding a trade because he felt betrayed and lied to.</p>

<p>Is that basically it?</p>

<p>I dont think these moves are all dumb without the benefit of hindsight, but so many of their moves have been really rough in retrospect for over a decade now. On the flip side it shows just how valuable hitting on a pick like Embiid is, so much so that its made up for a ton of the plethora of other mistakes.</p>

<p>Honestly the best thing that happened to Hinkie was getting ousted because now he can get all the credit and none of the blame for how the process went. Anything good was him, anything bad was everyone that followed him. He was able to tear shit down and didn&rsquo;t have to put it back together.</p>

      <label for="l64erpg" class="commentText"><p>It was stunning to me at the time.  Luka is on the extremely short list of players since LeBron that I was 100%, would bet my life on it for just about any amount of money, were going to be at <em>minimum</em> All-Star/All-NBA guys as long as they stay healthy.  Honestly my list is LeBron, Oden, AD, Embiid, Luka, Zion, and Wemby.  The only &ldquo;bummer&rdquo; from that is Oden, and quite frankly it was because of injuries.</p>

<p>Point being, I don&rsquo;t say that Luka was a sure thing lightly.  But he absolutely, 100% was.  Did I think he&rsquo;d be <em>this</em> good <em>this</em> fast?  Nope, not at all.  But he was so clearly the best player to me that him dropping to 3 felt surreal.</p>

He had Ben Simmons sitting out and got Harden for him for a run and then moved Harden for multiple pieces and picks - unprotected first, a pick swap, another first, 2 seconds and Batum and Covington.</p>

<p>His biggest oops were dumping Horford (which no one thought was bad at the time) and dumping Isaiah Joe (but Rivers utterly refused to play him so I think this was as much helping a player escape from jail as anything. I blame Rivers for his desire to leave for anywhere and Morey deserves some credit for the second round draft of Joe)</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s got two very solid returns for players who refused to play and made a better draft pick that Colangelo, Brown and Brand combined with Maxey. I&rsquo;m unclear what he could have done so much better</p>

If you had 2024 Harden with Embiid and Maxey you probably see the Sixers challenge the Knicks. Harden was good for two games vs the Celtics last year and he unlocked both Maxey and Embiid.

      <label for="l636ukw" class="commentText"><p>Well there was also a lot of bad luck on the way. Simmons and Embiid both got injured for their rookie years, Embiid for 2 years I think. This actually helped in a way and y&rsquo;all drafted Fultz, and then the bad luck really hit. Fultz got injured and literally forgot how to shoot, which ruined all his potential. Simmons never improved his jumper then let the internet get to him and was mentally fragile. Embiid was the last one left, but he&rsquo;s super injury-prone. You guys managed to flip Simmons for Harden, which was not a bad move, but Embiid continued to be injury-prone and Harden left. Maxey developed into an All-Star level talent, but again, Embiid is too injury-prone.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I’m a big Embiid defender but I really think he’s been super cursed with the roster construction around him. Jimmy for half a season was literally the best player he’s played with. Harden obviously better individual player but on downswing and they only got one full season together.</p>

<p>Signing Tobias Harris to a max and liking him so much they gave his unqualified brother a g league spot probably ruined Embiids prime. 6 years too many</p>

<p>Embiid was somehow +47 playing 41 minutes a game in the first round this year…</p>

      <label for="l63mfxe" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I&rsquo;m not a Sixers fan so I don&rsquo;t remember all the details. But I recall that it was more of a Ben decision. I recall there was possibly some riff between Ben (and Brown too?) on one side&hellip;and Jimmy on the other. They weren&rsquo;t exactly compatible on a personality level. Ben was probably in the vein of Wiggins and KAT of being too chill, and we know Jimmy wasn&rsquo;t a fan of that.</p>

<p>And their game didn&rsquo;t fit either since neither were exactly shooters and both wanted/needed the ball. The Toronto series got weird or something because Jimmy was the best ball handler and also more clutch, so he got it more than Ben and Ben was kind of left doing nothing on offense. So when the time came, they let Jimmy walk because they would rather roll with their number 1 draft pick  and was supposed to be the Star of the future along with Embiid. After all, to the extent they worked, they represented the success of the Process.</p>

<p>Obviously with Jimmy gone that money had to go somewhere, and that went to Tobias. But it was always more a decision to move forward with Ben over Jimmy rather than a decision to pick Tobias over jimmy. The Jimmy quote after the Heat win made it seem more like a Tobias decision when it really wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="l63chkw" class="commentText"><p>All signs point towards the Sixers having chose Ben Simmons (and to a lesser extent Brett Brown) over Butler, not Tobias and Horford. In the moment, that was absolutely the correct decision. Should they have tried harder to solve whatever problems made them have to make this decision? Of course they should have. But if you HAD to make a decision in the moment, Ben over Jimmy is what <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> GM’s would have chosen, and you’re delusional if you disagree</p>

      <label for="l6383hk" class="commentText"><p>It’s even more eye opening when you look at his numbers this season. Like according to the eye test it looked like he took a step back but nope it’s not just the eye test the numbers prove it, they are down to concerning levels.</p>

<p>Hasn’t played more than 65 games a season in his entire tenure with the Heat So for 5 years he’d miss at least 22% of the season.</p>

<p>Now to compare last season to this season. His FG% went down from 54% to 50%. Now these are from a PER spectrum; He only scores on 40% on drives into the paint this season, a decrease from 52% last season (That’s a 7th worst among all nba players this season). He only shoots 59% on layups and dunks, contrast to 63% last season.</p>

<p>Now for a player that plays physical basketball I think it’s safe to say there’s reason for concern as to these numbers. But sure Philly pay the man the Max till he’s <sup>38</sup>&frasl;<sub>39</sub></p>

<p>You&rsquo;re really underrating Morey as a GM. He traded for Harden and then re-tooling around him for years to keep them as contenders, including building a team perfect designed to give the best team ever a legitimate run for their money. He has been really good in Philly as well.</p>

<p>When was he ever up? He has built a single contender (2018 Rockets) in 20 years of being a GM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When did you start watching basketball? 5 years ago? As soon as he became the Rockets GM, that was around the time McGrady&rsquo;s body really started falling apart and got microfracture surgery not recommended by the team&rsquo;s staff. Morey immediately re-tooled on the spot around Yao and got Ron Artest and drafted Carl Landry and Aaron Brooks. That team took the eventual champion Lakers to 7 despite Yao breaking his foot during that series. If Yao had stayed healthy, the Rockets would have easily won the championship that year. Yao had Denver&rsquo;s number and always outplayed Dwight head 2 head.</p>

<p>He then got the swindle of the century for James Harden and put Dwight Howard next to him where they made it to the WCF against the Warriors, despite their starting PG and PF being injured.</p>

<p>And then came the Harden-CP3 Rockets that were probably the best team to never win a championship.</p>

<p>Those are 3 contenders, all under different coaches and with very different rosters, which he built without tanking for even a season. He can&rsquo;t account for freak accidents like injuries, but he&rsquo;ll always give your squad a fighting chance. Get mad at your cheap-ass owner for a change for not wanting to get into the heavy luxury tax territory.</p>

<p>Nobody in the NBA took statistics as seriously before Morey and he got the entire league to play his style of basketball. Saying he was never a great GM is like saying Billy Beane is shit because he never won a World Series.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible? we have Morey, of course it is.</li>
<li>Is it likely Jimmy is using the Sixers and an old contact to get a new deal out of the Heat? much more likely.</li>
