<p>Dudes a first option on a good team and puts up pretty big points, rebounds, and assists numbers.</p>

<p>I don’t think he will be a top 10 player, but if the Magic was a top 6 seed and he averages 25-8-5 on respectable efficiency he could land a All-NBA nod. All-NBA is a lot about staying healthy, being on a good team, and putting up numbers which are 3 things Paolo can do.</p>

<p>just want to clarify that we are good <em>because</em> of him lol. This is a team that was 3 wins away from the 2nd seed last season. We have top 4 in the east expectations this year, forget top 6. I think anyone paying attention to us can see that (but no one outside of our fanbase pays attention to us so it just sounds like homerism lol)</p>

<p>You guys were 2nd in DRTG and 22nd in ORTG in 2024</p>

<p>Magic had a solid 9-10 man rotation to the point you hardly had playing time for 2 lottery picks.</p>

<p>Boston, New York, Philly, Milwaukee, Cleveland all had better over/unders than Orlando heading into the season too. Saying top 6 isn’t a slight, and no one pays more attention than Sports Books.</p>

<p>Acting like no one follows you, and complimentary comments aren’t complimentary enough is pretty big homerism.</p>

<p>So mentioning Mo Bamba for your team having a solid 9-10 man rotation last year makes no sense… the Magic were the 2nd ranked defence in the league, it isn’t like Banchero is an All-D caliber guy.</p>

      <label for="ltjli6a" class="commentText"><p>The argument against TMac is pretty easy, even during his healthy years he played poorly in the playoffs. He averaged similar RPA but on horrible efficiency and missed a bunch of clutch shots. His rockets teams were more than good enough to go past the second round but it couldn’t happen with him being their offensive engine.</p>

      <label for="ltjms7d" class="commentText"><p>T-Mac played poorly in the playoffs???</p>

<p>he averaged <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.5 with the Magic and Rockets in the playoffs</p>

<p>the one year he had a player of any quality on his team, he and Yao took the 2nd best team in the league in the 06-07 Jazz to 7 games with T-Mac going for 29/5/13 in the close out game</p>

<p>don’t agree that the Rockets were more than good enough to get past the teams he lost to</p>

<p>don’t agree that</p>

<p>Alston/McGrady/Battier/Scola/Mutumbo</p>

<p>should beat</p>

<p>Deron Williams/Kyle Korver/Andrei Kirelenko/Carlos Boozer/Mehmet Okur with Millsap off the bench either</p>

<p>lenny wilkens, paul pierce, and lilliard can both take a hike</p>

<p>nobody until the nba 75 thought paul pierce was better than t mac</p>

      <label for="ltkdtvi" class="commentText"><p>lol Mac was definitely better than pierce. Don’t go revisionist history and/or looking at stats in a vacuum.</p>

<p>In their primes no one thought pierce was better, which is why Mac made all-nba  SEVEN times —  2x first team, 3x second team, and 2x third team.</p>

<p>Comparatively, Pierce was only all-nba four times, <em>never</em> made first team and only had one second team.</p>

      <label for="ltkgyhq" class="commentText"><p>That list is also revisionist history and it’s also dumb (no Dwight but dame is on there? lol)</p>

<p>Look at it year by year — they were both drafted in the late 90s and played in the exact same era. The people who were watching them day-in day-out saw that Mac was clearly better, and IN THE PRESENT, they voted on who they thought was better every year… which is why tmac has more all-nba selections — because he was better. It’s also why he was 2x first team and pierce never was — because Mac was better</p>

<p>Literally every year people voted on the best players and Mac was basically always above him. So it’s crazy no in hindsight to say pierce was better when literally no one thought that at the time. He just happened to get a chip with two of the best players ever</p>
