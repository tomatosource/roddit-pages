      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dllqw2/tobias_harris_postseason_stats_vs_top4_seeded/"><p>Tobias Harris postseason stats vs top-4 seeded teams as a Sixer (30 games): 13/7/3 on 51 TS%. Is he the most disappointing playoff performer of the last 5 years?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Stats by series:</p>

<p>2019 vs TOR: 14/9/4 on 47 TS% (3rd option)</p>

<p>2020 vs BOS: 16/10/4 on 46 TS% (2nd option)</p>

<p>2022 vs MIA: 16/6/3 on 55 TS% (4th option)</p>

<p>2023 vs BOS: 12/6/1 on 56 TS% (4th option)</p>

<p>2024 vs NYK: 9/7/2 on 51 TS% (3rd option)</p>

<p>I saw a post about Tobias Harris getting some interest in FA with people commenting how he would be useful on $15M/yr or so, and I felt an ethical obligation to point out how little this man contributes to winning. In addition to his dreadful averages, this man NEVER stepped up in the playoffs. Over these five series, Tobias Harris scored 20+ points on over 50% from the field three times, and all three games were in losses by an average of 10 points. He can&rsquo;t even provide league-average efficiency as a fourth option, getting wide-open looks and matchups against his opponents&rsquo; weakest defenders. He is <em>at best</em> an average defender and rebounder with negative bball IQ and no hustle. This man drew zero charges over 6 years as a Sixer. If your best-case scenario with Tobias is 14/6/2 on mediocre efficiency as a fourth option, wouldn&rsquo;t you rather spend the money on someone who scores more efficiently or is able to contribute to winning in ways other than scoring? Tobias Harris has no place on a serious team making anything above a TMLE.</p>

<p>Separately, has any player over the last 5 years been as disappointing in the playoffs at Tobias Harris? Contract aside, he&rsquo;s had a chance to redeem himself every postseason getting major minutes and has absolutely disappeared every single time. Thirty games is a pretty big sample of being terrible deep in the playoffs, especially considering his role. I would love to hear other contenders for this prestigious honor.</p>

      <label for="l9qusow" class="commentText"><p>Lost in as numbers is how Harris truly damaged the team with his inability to make quick decisions.</p>

<p>Tobi was good for maybe a handful of quick decision games a year, where he actually looked serviceable. The rest of the time he played like there was a 3 second delay baked into his decision making neural network.</p>

<p>Joel dishes the ball out to punish the other team for mobbing him? Go fuck yourself, it’s Tobbin’ time. Before he even figures out what he wants to do, the defense has recovered.</p>

<p>Outplayed by Kelly Oubre on a minimum. Frequently outplayed by Ricky Council on two
 way when the team needed him most. Absurd.</p>

<p>He was hot garbage statistically, but these statlines don’t reflect how much ball stopping he does and how many possessions he takes off defensively off ball.  The complete absence of any type of hustle, ever.</p>

      <label for="l9rpuq1" class="commentText"><p>As a long-time observer of the Philadelphia 76ers, I&rsquo;ve noticed a troubling trend: Tobias Harris is often unfairly scapegoated for the team&rsquo;s shortcomings. However, Harris is a much better player than many fans give him credit for, and I firmly believe he would thrive in an efficient offensive system. The blame for the team&rsquo;s struggles should be placed more on the dysfunctional offensive system than on Harris himself. Let’s dive into why Harris deserves more appreciation and how the team’s offensive issues have miscast him as a problem.</p>

<p>First and foremost, Harris is consistently one of the most reliable and versatile players on the roster. Over the past few seasons, he’s averaged around 18 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists per game, shooting efficiently from the field (47-49%) and beyond the arc (37-39%). These numbers are indicative of a player who is making significant contributions on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>The Real Issue: A Stagnant Offensive System</p>

<p>The Sixers’ offensive system, especially in recent years, has been heavily reliant on isolation basketball. This style of play doesn’t cater to Harris’s strengths. He excels in a more fluid, ball-movement-centric offense where he can leverage his mid-range game and off-ball movement. Instead, he often finds himself standing in the corner or being a secondary option while the primary ball-handlers dominate the offense.</p>

<p>To understand the stagnant nature of the team’s offense, consider these stats from the past season:</p>

<p>Isolation Frequency: The Sixers ranked in the top 5 in the league for isolation plays per game, with approximately 8.9% of their offensive possessions ending in isolation.</p>

<p>Ball Movement: The team was in the bottom third of the league in passes per game, averaging around 281 passes per game. For comparison, teams like the Warriors and Spurs, known for their ball movement, averaged well over 300 passes per game.</p>

<p>Assist Percentage: The Sixers were 21st in the league in assist percentage, with only 58.4% of their made field goals coming off assists. This is a clear indicator of the lack of ball movement and over-reliance on individual playmaking.</p>

<p>These stats paint a clear picture: the team’s offense often stagnates, which not only makes it easier for defenses to key in on primary scorers but also limits opportunities for players like Harris to thrive.</p>

<p>Because of this offensive stagnation, fans often point fingers at Harris when the team struggles. It’s easy to blame the secondary star when the primary offensive system isn’t delivering, but this is an unfair assessment. Harris’s value extends beyond raw stats—his basketball IQ, ability to create spacing, and willingness to play within the team concept are crucial for the team’s success.</p>

<p>In a system that emphasizes ball movement, player movement, and efficient shot selection, Harris could truly shine. His skill set is perfectly suited for a motion offense where his scoring versatility and off-ball capabilities would be maximized. Imagine Harris in an offense like the Warriors&rsquo; or the Spurs&rsquo;—teams that prioritize spacing, passing, and finding the best shot. He would likely see a significant uptick in both his efficiency and overall impact.</p>

<p>Another crucial aspect often overlooked is Harris’s availability. Over the past few seasons, he has been one of the most consistent and durable players on the team. While key players like Joel Embiid and James Harden have missed significant time due to injuries or other issues, Harris has been a reliable presence, consistently showing up and performing. His availability has been essential for maintaining some level of stability within the team.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Harris has had to adapt to various coaching changes, roster adjustments, and the fluctuating availability of key players. Despite these challenges, he’s remained a steady presence on the court, often stepping up in crucial moments. Harris has also embraced the city, the fans, and his role with grace, never complaining about the criticisms or the shifting dynamics around him. His professionalism and leadership are invaluable to the team, qualities that often go unrecognized but are essential for any successful team.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Tobias Harris is a much better player than many Sixers fans give him credit for. The team’s isolation-heavy offensive system has done him no favors, often highlighting his perceived weaknesses rather than his true strengths. It’s time we appreciate Harris for the solid, multifaceted player he is and recognize that the real issue lies in how the team’s offensive system is structured. Harris’s contributions are significant, and he deserves more respect for what he brings to the court.</p>

      <label for="l9prq0p" class="commentText"><p>Sixers fans are gonna miss whining about Harris so much. He’s not even close to the most disappointing playoff performer.</p>

<p>Many, many 20+ minutes players have shot worse than Harris in the playoffs, and many of them were not pulling down 6-10 boards (while playing with one of the best rebounders in the league).</p>

<p>Just sort advanced stats by TS% or NRTG, and you’ll see tons of worse performers than Harris. He’s paid too much, but he can absolutely help the right team. He’s certainly more useful than Buddy Hield, and I’d argue more useful than Oubre.</p>
