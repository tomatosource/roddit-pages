PJ Washington&rsquo;s dunk attempt at 00:51 would&rsquo;ve made it a 3 pt game and triggered a L2M.</p>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From the L2M description on the official.nba.com website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Below is the league&rsquo;s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night&rsquo;s games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>was listening to the Lowe Post and heard Zach Lowe say &ldquo;i cant wait for the Last 2 minute report&rdquo;. realized it hadnt come out yet, and saw in the description that it&rsquo;s only done for games within 3 pts during the last 2 minutes of the 4th.</p>

      <label for="l82jij5" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. Basketball is such a a hard sport to ref in real-time. The kind of physicality that is allowed makes every little thing a potential call. Dribbling and traveling rules only make things more complicated.</p>

<p>Back when I played competitively I remember being pretty annoyed sometimes when I thought I was getting fouled in ways I thought were obvious.</p>

<p>As a fan, though, I&rsquo;m just like &ldquo;Shut up and get back on defense&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Realistically, you would probably need 5 refs to have an eye on every matchup just to have things covered from the live angle.</p>

<p>And using replays too much messes with the flow and kills momentum like a time-out can.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s part of the reason they just kind of re-assessed all the &ldquo;gather step&rdquo; traveling rules and made them more lenient for the most part.</p>

<p>Especially because - back when they did call it more - a lot of players just got away with what would technically be travels simply because they were so quick it was hard to catch them in the moment.</p>

      <label for="l82n649" class="commentText"><p>Step backs and shot fakes are one thing, 2-steps on that is passable if you&rsquo;re not putting your hand under the ball.</p>

<p>But even hop steps were always kind of nebulous. If refs didn&rsquo;t think both feet landed at the same time, your pivot foot was all you had.</p>

<p>I remember I would use a hop step layup/floater that got called a handful of times, but not often.</p>

<p>I would swing the ball over or under a defender&rsquo;s hand while turning my back to them on the hop and then either twist my body back to finish with my outside-hand if they didn&rsquo;t commit to cutting me off, or finish with my inside hand like a floater if they did.</p>

<p>The explanation I got when it was called is that both of my feet didn&rsquo;t land at the same time after the first hop.</p>

<p>All I did was hop once and then go into my shot, though. Pretty &ldquo;meh&rdquo; compared to the three-ish steps players can do today on a euro step. But the times it got called didn&rsquo;t feel any different than when it wasn&rsquo;t called. So, who knows?</p>

<p>I even did it one time and there was one older ref that called it. Meanwhile the other ref - a guy only a handful of years older than me that I kind of knew who also played - told me didn&rsquo;t think it was a travel. He actually yelled &ldquo;Aw hell naw!&rdquo; and started laughing when I made the floater version. He gave the other ref a goofy face when he called it a travel because he thought he was calling it an and-one.</p>

      <label for="l82o548" class="commentText"><p>Well if it was a rec league they play by HS rules, so a hop is seen as step 2. You can’t step again. You can lift a foot, or both, but not step. A pro hop is gathering in the air so you can land staggered, or land two and have a pivot. So the refs were prob right in calling it.</p>

      <label for="l82tcdv" class="commentText"><p>It was just a pro hop. All I would do is hop once as the gather itself and go into a layup/floater.</p>

<p>I would dribble toward the middle of the basket with one hand, slow down and switch to dribble left or right (depending on the where the defender was) while shifting my body to shield the ball, and then hop while swinging the ball in the other direction of wherever they committed.</p>

<p>Like I said, it wasn&rsquo;t called about 90% of the time I did it. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it just looked awkward when I threw in that last dribble while shifting my body and a ref would just call it. It was only older refs that ever called it, too.</p>

<p>The funny thing is: it only got called in rec leagues. When I used it in actual high school games it never got called. And nobody on the opposing teams ever acted like it was a travel.</p>

<p>This was in the late 90s and early 2000s, too. So drag steps, pinoy steps and euro steps weren&rsquo;t even really a thing quite yet.</p>

      <label for="l820dj4" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s debatable whether Jaylens contact impacted the play or not. If you call that a foul at any rec center, you’re gonna start a fight because it’s such a weak call. Let alone calling it in the NBA finals. It really didn’t look impactful to me, more of a touch, and this is coming from a Lakers fan. That being said, when you’re in the air a slight nudge can change things. So really the only person who could tell us whether it truly was a foul was Brown or Washington IMO.</p>

<p>Forearm contact is okay. Contact initiated by offensive player is okay. Incidental hand contact without repercussions is okay. Placing hand on back is a foul.</p>

The fact that he kind of front rims the dunk made me think it was a foul. Hard call to make in the Finals though, obviously you want to let them play as much as possible.</p>

      <label for="l8323yj" class="commentText"><p>This may be the best answer I&rsquo;ve seen and it&rsquo;s from a Celtics fan (fuck you for the next week).  Is it a foul? Yes. Should it be called in the Finals? Probably not. Did it impact the ending of the game? Possibly. Should the mavs have taken control of the game and won before a controversial foul? 150%.</p>

Simply having a hand on him doesn’t warrant a foul, nor does incidental amount of force. The missed Tatum dunk where PJ jumps into his body lateral and moves him a foot off his path is 10x more egregious and more force than this, and also was in mid air.</p>

<p>That one wasn’t given multiple slow mo replays and this one did and let everyone over analyze everything that happened.</p>

<p>If you really want to call this on Jaylen, that means they missed about 20+ other calls throughout the game..can’t just fixate on this one because it happened in the last minute.</p>

<p>because in many situations it&rsquo;s entirely legal, but not to an offensive player going up for a jam.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for what&rsquo;s not a foul because of other missed calls. Only what objectively is foul in this case. I&rsquo;d say they should have got the other calls right too.</p>

<p>I mean objectively to what the rules have been that I grew up with, rather than previous missed calls, and maybe they have changed? But I think it&rsquo;s pretty standard that if you put a hand in anyone&rsquo;s back when they are going up it&rsquo;s a foul, for very good reason, safety. Maybe they should have called it hot-stove-contact or something? :)</p>
