PJ Washington&rsquo;s dunk attempt at 00:51 would&rsquo;ve made it a 3 pt game and triggered a L2M.</p>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From the L2M description on the official.nba.com website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Below is the league&rsquo;s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night&rsquo;s games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable)</p>

<hr>

<p>was listening to the Lowe Post and heard Zach Lowe say &ldquo;i cant wait for the Last 2 minute report&rdquo;. realized it hadnt come out yet, and saw in the description that it&rsquo;s only done for games within 3 pts during the last 2 minutes of the 4th.</p>

      <label for="l82jij5" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. Basketball is such a a hard sport to ref in real-time. The kind of physicality that is allowed makes every little thing a potential call. Dribbling and traveling rules only make things more complicated.</p>

<p>Back when I played competitively I remember being pretty annoyed sometimes when I thought I was getting fouled in ways I thought were obvious.</p>

<p>As a fan, though, I&rsquo;m just like &ldquo;Shut up and get back on defense&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Realistically, you would probably need 5 refs to have an eye on every matchup just to have things covered from the live angle.</p>

<p>And using replays too much messes with the flow and kills momentum like a time-out can.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s part of the reason they just kind of re-assessed all the &ldquo;gather step&rdquo; traveling rules and made them more lenient for the most part.</p>

<p>Especially because - back when they did call it more - a lot of players just got away with what would technically be travels simply because they were so quick it was hard to catch them in the moment.</p>

      <label for="l82n649" class="commentText"><p>Step backs and shot fakes are one thing, 2-steps on that is passable if you&rsquo;re not putting your hand under the ball.</p>

<p>But even hop steps were always kind of nebulous. If refs didn&rsquo;t think both feet landed at the same time, your pivot foot was all you had.</p>

<p>I remember I would use a hop step layup/floater that got called a handful of times, but not often.</p>

<p>I would swing the ball over or under a defender&rsquo;s hand while turning my back to them on the hop and then either twist my body back to finish with my outside-hand if they didn&rsquo;t commit to cutting me off, or finish with my inside hand like a floater if they did.</p>

<p>The explanation I got when it was called is that both of my feet didn&rsquo;t land at the same time after the first hop.</p>

<p>All I did was hop once and then go into my shot, though. Pretty &ldquo;meh&rdquo; compared to the three-ish steps players can do today on a euro step. But the times it got called didn&rsquo;t feel any different than when it wasn&rsquo;t called. So, who knows?</p>

<p>I even did it one time and there was one older ref that called it. Meanwhile the other ref - a guy only a handful of years older than me that I kind of knew who also played - told me didn&rsquo;t think it was a travel. He actually yelled &ldquo;Aw hell naw!&rdquo; and started laughing when I made the floater version. He gave the other ref a goofy face when he called it a travel because he thought he was calling it an and-one.</p>

      <label for="l82o548" class="commentText"><p>Well if it was a rec league they play by HS rules, so a hop is seen as step 2. You can’t step again. You can lift a foot, or both, but not step. A pro hop is gathering in the air so you can land staggered, or land two and have a pivot. So the refs were prob right in calling it.</p>

      <label for="l82tcdv" class="commentText"><p>It was just a pro hop. All I would do is hop once as the gather itself and go into a layup/floater.</p>

<p>I would dribble toward the middle of the basket with one hand, slow down and switch to dribble left or right (depending on the where the defender was) while shifting my body to shield the ball, and then hop while swinging the ball in the other direction of wherever they committed.</p>

<p>Like I said, it wasn&rsquo;t called about 90% of the time I did it. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it just looked awkward when I threw in that last dribble while shifting my body and a ref would just call it. It was only older refs that ever called it, too.</p>

<p>The funny thing is: it only got called in rec leagues. When I used it in actual high school games it never got called. And nobody on the opposing teams ever acted like it was a travel.</p>

<p>This was in the late 90s and early 2000s, too. So drag steps, pinoy steps and euro steps weren&rsquo;t even really a thing quite yet.</p>

      <label for="l820dj4" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s debatable whether Jaylens contact impacted the play or not. If you call that a foul at any rec center, you’re gonna start a fight because it’s such a weak call. Let alone calling it in the NBA finals. It really didn’t look impactful to me, more of a touch, and this is coming from a Lakers fan. That being said, when you’re in the air a slight nudge can change things. So really the only person who could tell us whether it truly was a foul was Brown or Washington IMO.</p>

      <label for="l82th3s" class="commentText"><p>Yep, this is why it was an obvious foul. The broadcast picked up on it immediately. The ref didn’t see the contact from behind and missed the call. It happens, but fans can rightfully be annoyed when the blown call effectively ends the game.</p>

      <label for="l83irqz" class="commentText"><p>For me it’s just that they didn’t call anything the entire 2nd half, but especially in the 4th. They called only 1 foul on the Mavs the entire 4th quarter. The Celtics shot 2FTs that quarter (Mavs got 7). There was a ton of contact that they were deeming marginal, and people want to single out one call as changing the game.</p>

<p>If they had called the game tight enough to make that call on Washington, the Celtics would’ve had at least a handful more FTs in the 4th to offset it.</p>

It’s the finals, the best two teams in the game, the peak of competition. It’s going to be close and one of the differentiators is how they’re able to keep up playing at a high level for the entire game, over the entire series. Just nonsense to say it shouldn’t come down to it.</p>

<p>It’s like a fundamental thing in basketball that is drilled into you from the very first time you join a team. Refs make bad calls sometimes. You benefit from some, you don’t from others. You can’t hyper focus on one call and ignore the ones that maybe went your way or everything else about the game when discussing the outcome because even tho it doesn’t feel like it’s worth the same, it is.</p>

I think it may have impacted his course some, but I think JB and White were still going to destroy that attempt. I think they would say that contact was marginal for that reason. It didn’t look like it impacted the result of the play to me, an unbiased observer who wouldn’t be arguing the exact opposite were it a Celtics player.</p>

There would have to have been downward momentum added, no? So if PJ was still on an upward raise at the basket, that would mean that the forward momentum made him get to the basket before the apex, but I don&rsquo;t think he was still going up? Rather he was already at the apex? Not sure that makes any sense tho</p>

      <label for="l83vkki" class="commentText"><p>This is largely how I feel except I see it both ways. I can’t tell whether the push impacted the play or not because he was loading up to jump when it happened. It could have messed up his timing on his jump and killed his upward momentum. It could have had zero effect. I honestly can’t tell. If he was in the air, it needed to be called. I think it looks like it could have but he was also jumping with two good shot blockers. I think that’s a situation where he probably just needed to go to plan B instead of taking it all the way to the hoop. The refs could have given him that call and it might have been 100% deserved or it might have been a gift. It really comes down to whether it impacted his jump which is really hard to say because it is possible it didn‘t.</p>

<p>I thnk that anyone who has played the game extensively should be able to recognize that. We&rsquo;ve had fights over fouls like this in my team because one teammate kept doing it during practice.</p>

From memory he pulled his hand back before the jump - didn’t really look like he pushed to me - more of a heads up too - as in “hey I’m right behind you - hang on the rim if you make it so we can all land safely”. Probably helped time the block.</p>

<p>At the same time if they’d called it I would get it. But that play happened so quickly - very tough call in real time.</p>

      <label for="l83qa1f" class="commentText"><p>Straight up. These guys haven&rsquo;t played rec league. You don&rsquo;t foul people on an open fast break. You just eat the 2 pts. Such a high risk play to stop 2 point in a game that doesn&rsquo;t mean shit. That&rsquo;s instantly going to cause a confrontation</p>

      <label for="l83tnhd" class="commentText"><p>also I just rewatched the Bron block again and wow you really went for a shameless stretch there didn’t you? JRs closed forearm barely brushed Andre, and you’re trying to use that to compare an open handed extended push in the small of PJ’s back while he’s loading up to jump? That is honestly the worst attempt at gaslighting I’ve ever seen in this sub and that’s saying something.</p>

White&rsquo;s block didn&rsquo;t seem to even matter because PJ came up short on the dunk attempt. The reason for that is because he got pushed in the back. You don&rsquo;t just misjump on a dink without something forcing that.</p>

Simply having a hand on him doesn’t warrant a foul, nor does incidental amount of force. The missed Tatum dunk where PJ jumps into his body lateral and moves him a foot off his path is 10x more egregious and more force than this, and also was in mid air.</p>

<p>That one wasn’t given multiple slow mo replays and this one did and let everyone over analyze everything that happened.</p>

<p>If you really want to call this on Jaylen, that means they missed about 20+ other calls throughout the game..can’t just fixate on this one because it happened in the last minute.</p>

<p>because in many situations it&rsquo;s entirely legal, but not to an offensive player going up for a jam.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for what&rsquo;s not a foul because of other missed calls. Only what objectively is foul in this case. I&rsquo;d say they should have got the other calls right too.</p>

<p>I mean objectively to what the rules have been that I grew up with, rather than previous missed calls, and maybe they have changed? But I think it&rsquo;s pretty standard that if you put a hand in anyone&rsquo;s back when they are going up it&rsquo;s a foul, for very good reason, safety. Maybe they should have called it hot-stove-contact or something? :)</p>
