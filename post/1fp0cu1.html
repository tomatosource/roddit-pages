<p>Also something I forgot to mention that still pisses me off, the NBA had a vote that Reggie‚Äôs salary should still count towards the cap, it‚Äôs a miracle that the Celtics recovered from that position to even be a decent team before the big 3.</p>

<p>I mean even now Celtics arent what they used to be and plenty of fans and people who were around pre 1990 hate the Celtics still. The team&rsquo;s dominance took a psychological toll on everyone lol</p>

      <label for="lovlg57" class="commentText"><p>In 1986, at the time of Bias&rsquo; passing, Bird&rsquo;s Celtics had 3 rings, Magic&rsquo;s Lakers had 3 rings. Their finals head-to-head record was 1-1.</p>

<p>They met again in the 1987 NBA Finals for their rubber series.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Lakers lineup was:</p>

<pre><code>Player (minutes)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>C - Kareem (34)</li>
<li>F - AC Green (24)</li>
<li>F - Worthy (39)</li>
<li>G - Byron Scott (30)</li>
<li>G - Magic (39)</li>
<li>6 - Michael Cooper (30)</li>
<li>7 - Mychal Thompson (28)</li>
<li>8 - Kurt Rambis (9)</li>
<li>9 - Wes Matthews (3)</li>
<li>10 - Adrian Branch (2)</li>
<li>11 - Mike Smrek (2)</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>While the Celtics lineup was:</p>

<ul>
<li>C - Parish (31)</li>
<li>F - McHale (39)</li>
<li>F - Bird (42)</li>
<li>G - Ainge (39)</li>
<li>G - DJ (40)</li>
<li>6 - Greg Kite (12)</li>
<li>7 - Jerry Sichting (9)</li>
<li>8 - Darren Daye (8)</li>
<li>9 - Fred Roberts (8)</li>
<li>10 - Sam Vincent (8)</li>
<li>11 - Bill Walton (4)</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Lakers was 7-man deep. Celtics were 5-man deep. With Parish and McHale both playing hurt. A rookie Len Bias could have been a huge help as the 6th man of the Celtics.</p>

<p>Lakers ended up winning their finals trilogy 2-1, and going on to win 1 more title. That was Bird&rsquo;s Celtics last finals appearance, as they were taken over by the younger, deeper Pistons team.</p>

<p>Larry can say that in hindsight but he was the biggest competitor and he basically had to be dragged off the court by the end. I‚Äôm not so sure he could have walked away if the Celtics were still making Finals etc</p>

Bias was drafted coming off a title win, and while you can play the butterfly effect game, the Celtics were still competitive for a few more years.  When Reggie died, Bird had just retired, and the Celtics were forced to pay out his contract to his widow (good), but it counted against the salary cap (bad) which just completely hamstrung them.</p>

Sampson was viewed as significantly better than Bowie and the deal would have been Drexler (14th pick previous year) + 2nd Pick for Sampson.  Rockets already had the 1st pick so they would have drafted Akeem at 1 and Jordan at 2 to pair with Drexler.</p>

      <label for="louuz51" class="commentText"><p>No. Not even close. If St. Louis never traded Bill Russell, the entire NBA landscape of the last 50 years would be different. The fallout from that decision set off a chain reaction of events over the next 15 years that never would&rsquo;ve played out that way if Boston didn&rsquo;t completely dominate the &lsquo;60s. I would bet my life that if Russell played for the Hawks his entire career, Michael Jordan never would&rsquo;ve been drafted by Chicago. Bird never ends up in Boston. And Magic doesn&rsquo;t go to the Lakers.</p>

<p>People really don&rsquo;t think about the butterfly effects of these things.</p>

      <label for="lovoty4" class="commentText"><p><strong>Len Bias&rsquo; death was orchestrated to cement Reagan&rsquo;s legacy and ensure Republican dominance</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In June 1986, Len Bias, a rising basketball star and newly drafted player for the Boston Celtics, died suddenly from a cocaine overdose. Officially, it was a tragic accident, but beneath the surface, Bias‚Äôs death was part of a larger, calculated move by the Reagan administration. This move was not only designed to manipulate public opinion and solidify Reagan‚Äôs War on Drugs legacy but also to ensure the continued dominance of the Republican Party and secure the election of Reagan‚Äôs Vice President, George H. W. Bush.</p>

<p><strong>The Strategic Timing:</strong> By mid-1986, the Reagan administration faced mounting challenges. Despite Reagan‚Äôs re-election in 1984, his presidency and his Republican party were increasingly threatened by economic difficulties, political scandals, and waning public support for the War on Drugs. Bias‚Äôs death was strategically timed to reinvigorate interest in the drug crisis and reinforce Reagan‚Äôs policies. The administration needed a dramatic event to renew public fear and solidify support for its anti-drug agenda.</p>

<p><strong>The Government‚Äôs Role:</strong> Bias wasn‚Äôt a first-time user. His friend and teammate, Terry Long, testified that Bias had introduced him to cocaine during their time at the University of Maryland. This meant Bias was already on the radar of federal agencies like the FBI. Recognizing his vulnerability, someone within the administration orchestrated a plan to exploit it. On the night of his death, Bias was given a lethal dose of tainted cocaine laced with toxic contaminants ‚Äîa move intended to be fatal and turn him into a martyr for the War on Drugs.</p>

<p><strong>Media Manipulation:</strong> The administration quickly exploited Bias‚Äôs death. Within hours, the story dominated headlines, with Bias portrayed as a victim of the drug epidemic. The media, heavily influenced by the administration, sensationalized the story to maximize its impact. This media frenzy created a wave of fear, perfectly aligning with Reagan‚Äôs needs to justify his stringent drug policies and rally public support.</p>

<p><strong>The Suspicious Death of Don Rogers:</strong> The scheme extended beyond Bias. Just eight days later, on June 27, 1986, 23 year old NFL player Don Rogers also died from a cocaine overdose just the night before his wedding rehearsal. Rogers, another promising young athlete, was part of the same operation. His death, occurring so close to Bias‚Äôs, reinforced the narrative that drug abuse was an imminent threat, further justifying the administration‚Äôs crackdown and the anti-drug measures being pushed through Congress.</p>

<p><strong>The Strategic D.C/Sacramento Locations:</strong> Len Bias died at his University of Maryland campus, just 15 miles from Reagan&rsquo;s Washington D.C White House HQ.  This proximity was strategically leveraged to maximize the media impact and public fear.</p>

<p>Also note that Don Rogers was known as &ldquo;The King of Sacramento&rdquo; having grown up there before attending UCLA.  His death occurred in nearby Carmichael, CA just 5 miles from Governor&rsquo;s mansion constructed during Reagan&rsquo;s 8 year tenure there as Governor of California.</p>

<p>Reagan&rsquo;s influence in both Sacramento and D.C can not be understated.  Within a week they had killed off the most prominent young athlete near their D.C HQ and the most prominent young athlete near their Sacramento HQ.  These events occurring on opposite coasts, both where Reagan had significant media influence, was intentionally designed to create a perception of a pervasive drug epidemic, spanning nationwide and further fueling the urgency of the drug crisis.</p>

<p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> The deaths of Bias and Rogers had significant consequences. In their wake, Congress quickly passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, known as the &ldquo;Len Bias Law.&rdquo; This legislation, which imposed mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, was passed with bipartisan support, including from Democrats who typically opposed Reagan‚Äôs policies. The law and other anti-drug measures became central to Reagan‚Äôs strategy for cementing his legacy.</p>

<p>The dramatic focus on these deaths allowed Reagan to distract from other pressing issues, such as economic troubles, the growing federal deficit, and the Iran-Contra scandal. The fear generated by these deaths enabled Reagan to reassert his tough-on-crime stance, securing political dominance for his administration and laying the groundwork for his Vice President, George H. W. Bush, to succeed him in the 1988 election.</p>

<p><strong>The Legacy and Impact on Bush:</strong> The success of Reagan‚Äôs anti-drug measures not only reinforced his legacy but also bolstered the Republican Party‚Äôs position. The heightened focus on drug issues and the perceived success of Reagan‚Äôs policies were instrumental in George H. W. Bush‚Äôs election as president in 1988. Reagan&rsquo;s drug policy and it&rsquo;s perceived success were the central theme of Bush&rsquo;s campaign.  The administration‚Äôs strategy ensured that the Republican Party maintained its influence and that Bush inherited a favorable political climate.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The deaths of Len Bias and Don Rogers were not merely tragic events but part of a meticulously planned political maneuver by the Reagan administration. These orchestrated deaths were designed to reinforce the War on Drugs narrative, distract from critical issues, and secure long-term Republican dominance. By creating a dramatic national crisis, the administration solidified Reagan‚Äôs legacy and paved the way for George H. W. Bush‚Äôs presidency. It‚Äôs time to examine the full scope of this strategy and its impact on American politics.</p>

If you remove the conspiracy that he was murdered you actually have a well presented argument of how the government weaponized his death to expedite an Act that would have long reaching effects on the African American community. So idk, I recommend not going down a conspiring rabbit hole.</p>

      <label for="lovjug9" class="commentText"><p>Hot take: the 80s were littered with power forwards that were awesome in college but didn‚Äôt translate in NBA superstars. Derrick Coleman, Danny Manning and Billy Owens were all first team all Americans that were drafted high and they had average careers. Everyone assumes he would have been Jordan‚Äôs biggest rival, and maybe he would have, but there‚Äôs just as good of a chance that his career would have been forgettable.</p>

<p>Also, you could argue that the Cavs were drafting for fit, but if Bias was an undisputed can‚Äôt-miss generational talent, he would have been drafted number one.</p>

      <label for="lovqk55" class="commentText"><p>Controversial take here from a Celtic fan, but a bit of that is very likely hyperbole.  We tend to overrate those who pass away young.  Consider that he was taken #2 behind Brad Daugherty who didn&rsquo;t exactly light the world on fire.  Also consider that one pick later, Chris Washburn was a complete bust.  Played a total of 72 career games before washing out of the league.</p>

<p>Nobody really knows what Bias would have turned into.  They can say he would have been the next Jordan, but a lot of that is them talking out of their ass.  Clearly not every great College player and high draft pick ends up great in the NBA.  Perhaps if Chris Washburn had overdosed on draft night, we&rsquo;d be talking about how he would have been the next Kareem.</p>

<p>What I do know is that len&rsquo;s friend testified:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Len Bias introduced me to coke,&rdquo; and portrayed Bias as a &ldquo;courtesy middleman&rdquo; in the drug trade. &ldquo;One time he knocked on my door and he had a dollar bill and he said, &lsquo;Try this,&rsquo;&rdquo; Long told the court.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Had he not died that night, him being a coke fiend probably would have limited his career regardless.</p>

<p>Definitely a big What If, though.</p>

If he didn&rsquo;t die but was still using drugs then he might still be like anywhere from 3 years in the league and bounced out of it upto a Shawn Kemp like career maybe. If he wasn&rsquo;t on drugs, then he could&rsquo;ve even been Lebron-like, who knows.</p>

      <label for="lov98ax" class="commentText"><p>You think LeBron can be LeBron while doing coke to the extent Len Bias was? That&rsquo;s why the not doing drugs is a what if, I don&rsquo;t really understand what the argument is. If he survived, doing the drugs to the extent he was, he was either dead or bounced early anyway or could have had a strong but fizzled out career like Kemp. If he wasn&rsquo;t doing drugs, he could have even been GOAT level but who can tell. I don&rsquo;t know where I discounted that other players do drugs.</p>

<p>He had a body Like Le bron</p>

<p>Jump shot like KD (no 3 then)</p>

<p>heart like Barkley</p>

<p>He was a scorer, rebounder and defender, he would have been a sf for the celtics, he needed to work on his handle and drive. he could score insideAnd out in half court or transition. He could not be stopped in college by anybody.</p>

Nets won that trade at the time, it was the Nets being the worst team in the league after they blew it up and the Celtics being smart enough to not draft Kris Dunn and Markelle Fultz/Josh Jackson that hindsight makes it look like the Celtics absolutely fleeced them.</p>

<p>If anything, use 2008 as an example because McHale just gifted us KG which was more of a lopsided trade, but idc if some guy thinks it‚Äôs dumb/unfair we got Bill Russell, St Louis should have just not been racist lmao</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ainge was immediately lambasted for the trade. Wallace carried a three-year, $30 million contract and the other players in the deal were nowhere near All-Star caliber players. Despite their advanced ages, Pierce, Garnett and Terry were seen as players who could still contribute to a title contender, which the Nets were projected as with the trio joining All-NBA guards Deron Williams and Joe Johnson. &ldquo;</p>

<p>The idea was that yes, kg and pierce were older, but deron Williams was essentially 1a/b in PG rankings at the time with CP3 and Joe Johnson also had a ton of hype.  At worse they were a title contender where the old guys will still be able to somewhat contribute.  The picks traded were also super deferred so most likely they would be lower picks as the nets are a championship contender for about 3-5 years.  Obviously it turns out kg and pierce were way more washed than expected (kg went from averaging 14.8ppg to 6.5 immediately, Pierce went from 18.6 to 13.5).  Deron Williams also essentially immediately started regressing too at a crazy rate.  Like imagine if immediately the year when lebron rejoined the Cavs, he started averaging single digit scoring and assist.  It was unreal how bad deron was and how good he was before joining the nets</p>

<p>The irony of complaining the Celtics championships came from incompetent GM‚Äôs handing them all their titles while the Lakers have been inept but get bailed out because of being a large metropolitan area with warm weather, proving they can just do whatever by missing on Tatum and Brown and lucking into talent.</p>

<p>LeBron will retire, the Lakers will be bad for 1 year, and then a star from a small market will come to LA in a forced trade or free agency because that‚Äôs the advantage LA has that no other team does.</p>
