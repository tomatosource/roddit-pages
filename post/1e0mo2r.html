      <label for="lcnw82z" class="commentText"><p>I get where the Nuggets are coming from on this one. Murray hasn&rsquo;t been the healthiest for them. They want some added insurance in the max contract. Murray has also never been an all-star and, though he has the reputation of being a playoff riser, this past post-season his shooting splits were 40/32/92.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since the championship, the Nuggets have fumbled the Brown and KCP situations and now are having a hard time extending the 2nd best player of that title run.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not fair to call the Brown situation a &ldquo;fumble&rdquo; because they were limited in the amount they could give him.</p>

<p>KCP is different. They could have paid him, but they didn&rsquo;t believe in their ability to fill out the bench while in the 2nd apron restrictions or they didn&rsquo;t want to pay a big tax bill. Either way, one is a bad look for the FO and the other is a bad look for ownership.</p>

      <label for="lcodzqn" class="commentText"><p>Being under the second apron where the Nuggets are only gives them the TPMLE which they used to sign Dario Saric to a bad contract they will probably have to try and dump again like they did with Reggie Jackson. Is that worth letting KCP walk?</p>

<p>Every time someone tries to sell people on letting KCP walk to avoid the second apron they kind of ignore that the point of financial flexibility and being under the second apron is that it is a means to acquire better players and that letting a player much better than anyone else you can possibly bring in walk to achieve that kind of defeats the purpose.</p>

      <label for="lcofzdt" class="commentText"><p>The TPMLE with a player option for a player who can&rsquo;t play in the playoffs alongside Jokic, which already cuts the upside to like 10 good minutes, on the wrong side of thirty after nasty injuries, who wasn&rsquo;t even in the rotation for a team that got knocked out in the play-ins? It&rsquo;s an awful move.</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot that DeAndre Jordan was re-signed, DaRon Holmes II was drafted, and Zeke Nnaji is still - currently - on the roster and will either cost to move off of or will need to play to recoup any sort of value. So he&rsquo;s the (currently) fourth centre on a team with Jokic.</p>

<p>If DeAndre has sparingly played the last two seasons why would he be above saric?  He&rsquo;s only being resigned as a good locker room presence</p>

<p>The front office has already said they view Holmes as a 4, but even if he was a center what would automatically put him.above  Saric on the depth chart? He could be horrible In the NBA he hasn&rsquo;t even played a minute.</p>

<p>Zeke has also proven too small to be a center but they&rsquo;ll probably just attach draft picks to move off him. In no way do they have to force him minutes.</p>

      <label for="lcodk2z" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn’t call it obnoxious because we haven’t seen the bench upgrades yet. Once those upgrades are acquired, then I think we can ask KCP vs bench upgrades. If Braun steps up and yall get two players that contribute then it will be a no brainer.</p>

<p>But KCP fits perfectly playing 30+ minutes next to Nikola so if all yall get is one 15 min bench guy and a worse starting lineup then it will be clear that second apron + KCP would have been the better choice.</p>

<p>And I think it’s normal for people to feel like a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush, and it’s also normal for people to mourn the loss of a 3&amp;D (the most valuable role player)</p>

<p>If you want to sell someone on the benefits of letting KCP walk you kind of have to include what the Nuggets have done, and can do, with those benefits - and that does not add up to a KCP level player. Also since when has having one strong defensive wing meant you don&rsquo;t need any other defensive wings? Before when KCP would come out the game Christian Braun might come in. When Christian Braun comes out the game, who comes in for him?</p>

<p>Strawther who looked good last season until injuries took him out of the rotation. The nuggets have a history of hitting on late draft picks so I don&rsquo;t really see any reason to panic.</p>

      <label for="lcosawu" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re talking like staying under the second apron opens up an enormous amount of options - it doesn&rsquo;t. Nuggets staying under got access to the TPMLE, which they burned on Dario Saric, and it lets them aggregate salaries in a trade which is a bit meaningless when their tradeable salary is pretty much just Zeke Nnaji and they have just enough assets to cover dumping him, let alone getting a player back who is KCP quality.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Firstly Braun is not a better defender than KCP. He is not a better player than KCP - and shooting is an enormous part of that role. Secondly, not sure you if you were aware of this because you&rsquo;re talking like you weren&rsquo;t, but you weren&rsquo;t obliged to waive Christian Braun if you kept KCP. They are not in competition for a spot on the roster - you could have both! Thirdly &lsquo;all flexibility&rsquo; is not much flexibility, not enough to get a KCP quality player back, and currently has been spent to bring in Dario Saric.</p>

<p>Acting like losing KCP is fine because you have &lsquo;flexibility&rsquo; is pure cope, it really is. It&rsquo;s trading the boat for the mystery box except you have the benefit of knowing what is in the mystery box and it&rsquo;s  99% likely to be a shit.</p>

      <label for="lcoh4dv" class="commentText"><p>If Nugs don’t pay Jamal, they run the risk of souring their rep amongst the players. Gotta take care of your guys following a championship. Look at all those max contracts the Celtics gave out to their guys. How many chips do they have again?</p>

      <label for="lcoeoeq" class="commentText"><p>The important thing is, can Denver flip him for better? Can they risk letting him go next summer to get that team friendly contract?</p>

<p>You can get away with this as the 3rd or 4th option but as the second option, it often means high bidders comming in just to have their own 1st option.</p>
