      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f5wfht/can_someone_explain_a_3_point_statistic_i/"><p>Can someone explain a 3 point statistic I recently heard about?</p>

    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Okay, so apologies first and foremost that I am a super casual basketball fan and don’t know much about the game, but I heard a super interesting statistic somewhat recently and I was curious if someone could elaborate on it or explain it in further detail.</p>

<p>Essentially, someone explained to me that all of the recent championship winners statistically have the most three point attempts in the league. Not necessarily the most three points total, but specially the most <em>attempts</em>. They went on to explain that just by attempting three pointers more often than other teams, they have more opportunities to score higher and thereby win the game.</p>

<p>How does this work?</p>

<p>Why don’t all teams just focus solely on three point shots?</p>

<p>Is this breaking the game at all?</p>

<p>Other than it being a higher point value, why is there a significant advance to three pointers over two pointers?</p>

<p>Am I totally behind on learning this and is there something currently being done to address this?</p>

      <label for="lkw3vqt" class="commentText"><p>This year felt like an outlier for the Celtics tbh. They lead the league in makes(1,351) and attempts(3,482) while shooting 39% from 3 as a team. The gap in makes between them and 2nd place is almost as large as the one between 2nd(Warriors-1,211) and 12th(Jazz-1,060) place. If they&rsquo;re able to sustain this for a couple of seasons the league is fucked.</p>

      <label for="lkvxl1k" class="commentText"><p>Hi! Welcome to the sub!</p>

<p>It’s true that in general teams have been trending towards attempting more and more 3s, and that was prompted by the success of the Warriors in the 2010s which were one of the first teams to adopt this trend and the first to have the personnel to really implement it successfully.</p>

<p>However now that the whole league has caught on to the value of the 3, it can’t be said that the team attempting the most 3s is always the best. Last season the Nuggets won the title, but only 36% of their shot attempts were 3s, bottom 10 in the league. Meanwhile 49% of the Mavs’ shot attempts were 3s (highest in the league), and they finished in the bottom third of their conference.</p>

<p>This year the Celtics had the highest 3pt attempt rate and did in fact win the title, but the defending champion Nuggets were actually dead last in 3pt attempt rate. So you can still succeed with a variety of different playstyles.</p>

<p>But yeah, the Nuggets who were last in 3pt attempt rate this year still took more threes than the Rockets did 10 years ago when they led the league in 3s attempted.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Last season the NBA as a whole shot 54.5% on 2s, and 36.6% on 3s.</p>

<p>2 * .545 = 1.09 points per 2pt shot</p>

<p>3 * .366 = 1.098 points per 3pt shot</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re at the point where 3s and 2s are about equal value on average</p>

<p>teams have started to shoot way more threes and often very good teams shoot a lot of threes, but no it&rsquo;s not nearly as clear cut as &ldquo;shoot more 3s and you win&rdquo; and the best team is not always the team that shoots the most 3s.</p>

      <label for="lkw9osq" class="commentText"><p>I mean that’s just not true. The 2023 Nuggets were 25th in 3PA and 18th in total threes in the regular season. In the playoffs the Nuggets ranked second last in threes attempted and 11th in threes made.</p>

<p>The 2020 Lakers were 23rd in both attempts and makes from deep in the regular season. In the postseason they were 11th in attempts and makes from three.</p>

<p>At the end of the day three is worth more than two so teams can make up for some lack of top end talent with the three pointer look at the Heats run from 2023. At the same time by relying so heavily on the three the team becomes more volatile like what happened to Houston against the Warriors in 2018.</p>

<p>Boston relies heavily on the three but their entire team can shoot if from deep so there’s less ups and downs. Even when they go cold from deep they are an elite defensive team and can fall back on that and Tatum and Brown grinding out twos to win.</p>

      <label for="lkvz97g" class="commentText"><p>Part of it is also be correlation and not causation, at least in that direction. Teams with effective offenses will generate a lot of shots. And teams with good shooters will have more people be allowed to take shots. So it may be more that taking a lot of shots is an indicator of good teams.</p>

<p>In other words, a team with bad shooters and a stagnant offense chucking up a lot of bad contested shots may not do well.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Teams with good shooters tend to win more games. Teams with good shooters tend to take more threes. It’s tempting to conclude that more threes = more wins, but that’s only true if you have the shooting talent. Not every team does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other than it being a higher point value, why is there a significant advantage to three pointers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It forces defenders to stand far away from the rim in order to contest those threes, which makes it much easier to attack the basket without someone getting in your way.</p>
