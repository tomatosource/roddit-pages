      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f5wfht/can_someone_explain_a_3_point_statistic_i/"><p>Can someone explain a 3 point statistic I recently heard about?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Okay, so apologies first and foremost that I am a super casual basketball fan and don’t know much about the game, but I heard a super interesting statistic somewhat recently and I was curious if someone could elaborate on it or explain it in further detail.</p>

<p>Essentially, someone explained to me that all of the recent championship winners statistically have the most three point attempts in the league. Not necessarily the most three points total, but specially the most <em>attempts</em>. They went on to explain that just by attempting three pointers more often than other teams, they have more opportunities to score higher and thereby win the game.</p>

<p>How does this work?</p>

<p>Why don’t all teams just focus solely on three point shots?</p>

<p>Is this breaking the game at all?</p>

<p>Other than it being a higher point value, why is there a significant advance to three pointers over two pointers?</p>

<p>Am I totally behind on learning this and is there something currently being done to address this?</p>

<p>36% from three = 54% from two, it&rsquo;s just a math game on what you&rsquo;re willing to give up</p>

<p>also, i&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s entirely true, i do feel like it&rsquo;s evening out,</p>

<p>Nuggets, Bucks (playoffs), Lakers, Raptors, none took an absurd amount of threes</p>

      <label for="lkw3vqt" class="commentText"><p>This year felt like an outlier for the Celtics tbh. They lead the league in makes(1,351) and attempts(3,482) while shooting 39% from 3 as a team. The gap in makes between them and 2nd place is almost as large as the one between 2nd(Warriors-1,211) and 12th(Jazz-1,060) place. If they&rsquo;re able to sustain this for a couple of seasons the league is fucked.</p>

      <label for="lkx2xjh" class="commentText"><p>It was an outlier for makes for sure (39% is nutso, so it&rsquo;s not a diss) but they&rsquo;re built to take (and make) threes. Tatum&rsquo;s a supremely underrated 3pt shooter, and their entire starting lineup can and will shoot threes. On the flip side, they don&rsquo;t really have an incredible post scorer aside from the Zinger on a good day, nor do they really want to shoot midrange shots. Nobody is really a super deadly layup or dunk machine, either. I&rsquo;m obviously oversimplifying, but my point is that usually, shooting 3s mathematically works very well for them&hellip; so their entire gameplan is predicated around three point shooting and impenetrable defense. It&rsquo;s also what almost won them the ring in 2022. I can see them putting up similar numbers going forward.</p>

      <label for="lkx7w6s" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s true but I think if Tatum unlocks the part of his game where he starts frequenting more into driving the lane, that&rsquo;s gonna make him an even better shooter because the threat of driving the rim is gonna make the teams conscientious about it. Right now, he can go into this poor shot selection rhythm of contested step back 3s.</p>

<p>If he starts using his physicality more, they&rsquo;re gonna become a better 3pt team. He&rsquo;s got the right spacing around him to be even more threatening from other zones.</p>

      <label for="lkvxl1k" class="commentText"><p>Hi! Welcome to the sub!</p>

<p>It’s true that in general teams have been trending towards attempting more and more 3s, and that was prompted by the success of the Warriors in the 2010s which were one of the first teams to adopt this trend and the first to have the personnel to really implement it successfully.</p>

<p>However now that the whole league has caught on to the value of the 3, it can’t be said that the team attempting the most 3s is always the best. Last season the Nuggets won the title, but only 36% of their shot attempts were 3s, bottom 10 in the league. Meanwhile 49% of the Mavs’ shot attempts were 3s (highest in the league), and they finished in the bottom third of their conference.</p>

<p>This year the Celtics had the highest 3pt attempt rate and did in fact win the title, but the defending champion Nuggets were actually dead last in 3pt attempt rate. So you can still succeed with a variety of different playstyles.</p>

<p>But yeah, the Nuggets who were last in 3pt attempt rate this year still took more threes than the Rockets did 10 years ago when they led the league in 3s attempted.</p>

Even the end of the bench guys don’t miss when they are warming up, and everything they do is so methodical and their technique is so perfect, you will see centers who should never be shooting threes in actual games drain 20 in a row like its nothing! NBA warmups compared to high school warmups or even college warmups is such a ridiculous difference, in my opinion it is one of the most interesting parts of NBA games</p>

<p>If the same team were to shoot 100 three point shots and shoot 40% they would score 120…</p>

<p>NBA analytics figured out if you can push the pace and attempt more shots especially 3 point shots as long as they can convert them at a high enough rate it’s in their favor… of course every team is now doing that which is why perimeter shooting is at a premium and the difference between a 40% 3 point shooter and a 30% shooter is massive over the course of a season</p>

<p>The Jay Celtics are probably the closest to playing this style of recent championships, aside from the Warriors 22 chip. I’d say the Celtics built around having lots of shooting options as well so when they moved the ball, most of their roster could hit from deep.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Last season the NBA as a whole shot 54.5% on 2s, and 36.6% on 3s.</p>

<p>2 * .545 = 1.09 points per 2pt shot</p>

<p>3 * .366 = 1.098 points per 3pt shot</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re at the point where 3s and 2s are about equal value on average</p>

      <label for="lkx9s7m" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I just think when we talk about 3poijt efficiency versus 2s we don&rsquo;t usually include dunks and layups.</p>

<p>The league converted mid range attempts to 3pt ones. It&rsquo;s not effective to take less layups/dunk attempts in favor of 3s.</p>

<p>The stat doesn&rsquo;t show the full picture. To someone new to basketball, they might just think all shots are as efficient, so who cares?</p>

      <label for="lkvy09e" class="commentText"><p>the team that won this season led the league in attempts, the year before that the team that won was 25th in attempts.</p>

<p>teams have started to shoot way more threes and often very good teams shoot a lot of threes, but no it&rsquo;s not nearly as clear cut as &ldquo;shoot more 3s and you win&rdquo; and the best team is not always the team that shoots the most 3s.</p>

      <label for="lkw9osq" class="commentText"><p>I mean that’s just not true. The 2023 Nuggets were 25th in 3PA and 18th in total threes in the regular season. In the playoffs the Nuggets ranked second last in threes attempted and 11th in threes made.</p>

<p>The 2020 Lakers were 23rd in both attempts and makes from deep in the regular season. In the postseason they were 11th in attempts and makes from three.</p>

<p>At the end of the day three is worth more than two so teams can make up for some lack of top end talent with the three pointer look at the Heats run from 2023. At the same time by relying so heavily on the three the team becomes more volatile like what happened to Houston against the Warriors in 2018.</p>

<p>Boston relies heavily on the three but their entire team can shoot if from deep so there’s less ups and downs. Even when they go cold from deep they are an elite defensive team and can fall back on that and Tatum and Brown grinding out twos to win.</p>

      <label for="lkvz97g" class="commentText"><p>Part of it is also be correlation and not causation, at least in that direction. Teams with effective offenses will generate a lot of shots. And teams with good shooters will have more people be allowed to take shots. So it may be more that taking a lot of shots is an indicator of good teams.</p>

<p>In other words, a team with bad shooters and a stagnant offense chucking up a lot of bad contested shots may not do well.</p>

<p>Why don’t all teams just focus solely on three point shots?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Teams with good shooters tend to win more games. Teams with good shooters tend to take more threes. It’s tempting to conclude that more threes = more wins, but that’s only true if you have the shooting talent. Not every team does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other than it being a higher point value, why is there a significant advantage to three pointers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It forces defenders to stand far away from the rim in order to contest those threes, which makes it much easier to attack the basket without someone getting in your way.</p>

<p>So, if teams were to observe &ldquo;hey if we attempt the most 3s, we can win the Title!&rdquo; and then start solely trying to ATTEMPT the most 3s, it would no longer be true. You could try a half-court or heavily-contested 3 every time you get the ball. The Celtics last year were good because they did take the most 3s, but that&rsquo;s because they generated a lot of GOOD looks at the 3. If a team just tried to force it, they&rsquo;d likely fail.</p>

        <div>1 | 11 hours ago </div>
      </div>
      <label for="lky2lpz" class="commentText"><p>A simple way to think about it is in terms of expected points per shot attempt. The best scoring plays in the NBA, ranked by expected points per shot, would be</p>

<ol>
<li>dunk / layup</li>
<li>free throws</li>
<li>three pointer</li>
<li>midrange jump shot</li>
</ol>

<p>Dunks/layups and free throws are obvious&ndash; those have a very high conversion rate. (Actually, I think the average free throw might even be higher percentage than the average dunk/layup&ndash; not sure.) However, three pointers are right up there, because even thought they have a lower conversion rate, the makes are worth 50% more than 2 point makes.</p>

<p>So say a player shoots 40% from midrange and 30% from 3. These percentages would make him a decent midrange shooter (not too far off from the league average), but an atrocious 3 point shooter. Nonetheless, his expected points per midrange shot would be 2 x .4 = 0.8 pts / shot, whereas his expected points per three point shot would be 3 x .3 = 0.9 pts / shot. So despite shooting a much lower percentage on 3s, it&rsquo;s actually better for him to be taking those 3s since on average he&rsquo;ll score more points per shot from them.</p>

<p>The league used to be dominated by players posting up and taking midrange jumpers, but there&rsquo;s been a steadily increasing trend for teams to really spam the high efficiency plays (dunks/layups, free throws, and 3s) and avoid the lower efficiency ones (mainly midrange jump shots, and <em>especially</em> long 2s, which used to be fairly common but are almost never seen anymore). Historically significant teams that really pushed things in this direction were the Steve Nash Suns, the Steph Curry Warriors, and the James Harden Rockets.</p>

<p>It used to be the case that teams that emphasized the 3 point shot and de-emphasized the midrange shot had a significant advantage over the average NBA team, which still would be playing what is now regarded as a grossly inefficient style of offense. That&rsquo;s not quite as much the case anymore, since pretty much every team has caught on and this style of play that heavily emphasizes 3s and heavily de-emphasizes midrange shots is pretty much a uniformly adopted play style across the league. Even the teams that nowadays are ranked mid to low in terms of frequency of 3 pointers take way, way more 3s than even the most 3-point-happy teams from 10 or 15 years ago.</p>

<p>As a new fan of the NBA, an interesting experiment for you to try might be to watch a few games from last season, and then watch some games from ~10 years ago, ~20-30 years ago, and ~40-50 years ago. It almost looks like the players are playing different sports. Part of that is due to things like rule changes, but a whole lot is due to evolving strategies and the gradual collective optimization of the game of basketball. The way the NBA game is played now would look completely bizarre and alien to a fan from 20 years ago.</p>

      <label for="lkzc5bx" class="commentText"><p>Looking back at the past six finals, we have (attempts/3PT%):</p>

<ul>
<li>2019: Raptors (11th / 6th) defeated Warriors (8th / 3rd)</li>
<li>2020: Lakers (23rd / 21st) defeated Heat (8th / 2nd)</li>
<li>2021: Bucks (8th / 5th) defeated Suns (15th / 7th)</li>
<li>2022: Warriors (3rd / 8th) defeated Celtics (9th / 14th)</li>
<li>2023: Nuggets (25th / 4th) defeated Heat (10th / 27th)</li>
<li>2024: Celtics (1st / 2nd) defeated Dallas (2nd / 13th)</li>
</ul>

<p>Five out of the last six champions were in the top 10 in the league for three-point percentage.</p>

<p>The only exception is the Lakers, who placed a big emphasis on paint defense and offensive rebounding, with AD playing at the 4. They were such a cool and unusual team for the current era!</p>

<p>It seems that the QUALITY of your three-point shots is more important than the quantity. The Nuggets, for example, didn’t shoot from long distance often, but they got a lot of open looks thanks to Jokic’s great playmaking.</p>

<p>Of course, championship teams excel in many statistical categories—that’s what makes them great—but I believe that 3PT% is a stronger indicator of a team’s level of play than the number of attempts.</p>
