      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dctlzd/despite_averaging_97_rebounds_per_game_in_the/"><p>Despite averaging 9.7 rebounds per game in the playoffs (10th), Luka Doncic has 0.3 box outs per game (68th out of players that average at least 25 mins). Kyrie Irving averages twice as many box outs, and Jayson Tatum has more box outs in 2 finals games than Luka all playoffs.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

<p>Now Luka is a guard, so it makes sense that he averages a low amount of box outs. However other, smaller guards (that don&rsquo;t get nearly as many boards) still rank above him this postseason.</p>

<ul>
<li>Luka Doncic has 0.3 per game</li>
<li>Kyrie Irving has 0.6 per game</li>
<li>Jrue Holiday has 1.1 per game</li>
<li>Donovan Mitchell had 1.3 per game</li>
<li>Devin Booker had 1.5 per game</li>
<li>Haywood Highsmith had 1.4 per game</li>
<li>Kyle Lowry had 1.3 per game</li>
<li>CJ McCollum had 1.0 per game</li>
<li>Josh Hart had 0.9 per game</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?PerMode=Totals&amp;PORound=4" target="_blank">Jayson Tatum has had 8 box outs across 2 finals games</a> and <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Doncic&amp;PORound=0&amp;PerMode=Totals" target="_blank">Luka Doncic has had 6 box outs over 19 playoff games</a>.</p>

<p>Not all rebounds are created equal. Luka gets a lot of the classic Westbrook uncontested rebounds. For example, in 2017-18 (the first year box outs were tracked) Westbrook averaged 10.1 rebounds per game but had <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*westbrook&amp;PORound=0&amp;PerMode=PerGame&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season" target="_blank">0.9 box outs per game</a>.</p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t seem to go any further than the Westbrook uncontested rebound controversy back in his triple double years but in general raw rebound totals tell you next to nothing about how well a guard actually contributes to team rebounding</p>

<p>Luka could average 33/1/9 instead of 33/9/9 and he&rsquo;d still be ranked exactly the same for me</p>

<p>Our team rebounding as a whole went up with Westbrook yearly and there were years were he was near the top of the league in rebounding deflections.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why people have adopted this belief that uncontested rebounds just mean nothing lol, if you are in position for a uncontested rebound, that doesn’t guarantee that your team would have gotten the board regardless. There is <em>some</em> impact for sure.</p>

      <label for="l81b06p" class="commentText"><p>Getting Westbrook the ball in his hands first was a good idea for so long.  He could put pressure on the defense from the backcourt because his speed was otherworldly and he could pass the ball very well(also I don&rsquo;t think OKC had big men who could pass consistently, I&rsquo;d rather it be Westbrook).  For me, it works the same with Doncic since his touch and power while passing has turned into some easy buckets throughout this playoff run.  Doncic is a threat to pass from anywhere on the court effectively, so I like that he gets rebounds, plus he does have a good nose for the ball.  And then of course, the ball handlers getting the ball leads to less turnovers in the backcourt.</p>

<p>This is where I see the greatest impact is when Doncic or Westbrook get a defensive rebound.</p>

      <label for="l82e7za" class="commentText"><p>People parrot this but OKC was bad to average every year in transition when Russ had the reigns, maybe one year of creeping into the top 3rd. His MVP year they were legitimately bad in that regard. It wasn&rsquo;t some fivehead plan by them, it was just Russ wanting boards. I&rsquo;m not even saying that negatively, but it&rsquo;s all it was. And for transition it makes way more sense to have Russ leak out and someone pass it to him (not necessarily EVERY time, but just as an option). Ball moves faster than people and Adams is a terrific passer. He&rsquo;s just obviously never been asked to do it a lot.</p>

<p>It could also be argued they&rsquo;d have been even worse in transition if Russ didn&rsquo;t get so many rebounds off the rip, but that&rsquo;s hard to tell either way I guess. It&rsquo;s completely fine if they want to get those easy rebounds, but it isn&rsquo;t that advantageous over just passing it to them quickly, which is what happens either way.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single stat that shows it&rsquo;s effective.</p>

      <label for="l82ydrf" class="commentText"><p>I remember Adams making some highlight passes, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call him a great passer.  I think that last full season in Memphis he was asked to do more in the offense than maybe any other time in his career, and it showed people things beyond what they had seen in OKC.</p>

<p>I think the speed that Westbrook brought was intimidating to many transition defenses and it created chaos.  But, I agree with you, passing down the court is just better because it can usually beat transition.  I think transition defenses are still in transformation today because I have seen some interesting way coaches are using their players to slow down offensive systems like Indiana employed this playoffs, but transition defense was a pretty big weakness to most attacks seven years ago and the rules have definitely changed with the offensive fouls that a player with the ball receives when swerving or backing into a defensive player or the transition take foul.  Westbrook charging at or past people just wasn&rsquo;t something most players handled well.  If Westbrook had touch he would have been so hard to guard at his speed.  That OKC team during Westbrook&rsquo;s MVP season though, it was as if they designed a team that couldn&rsquo;t run the fast break.  Despite a couple good young players like Oladipo and Grant, it was a half court team that was constantly setting up for an offensive rebound because they were going to be available.</p>

<p>Anyway, off track.  Agreed, passing is the way, and these days, it needs to be more pinpoint than ever as defenders are really aware of those over the top tosses now.</p>

I&rsquo;m not even speaking on him individually, but what you said is just not true. Unless you mean like literal team rebounding as in that stat, but I don&rsquo;t think you mean that haha.</p>

<p>A coach like Pop would call a timeout 2 minutes into a game if his star did stupid shit like this and chew his ass out in front of the team.</p>

<p>Stars gotta hold themselves accountable. You can miss shots, not execute plays well, make mistakes in assignments or bad fouls &hellip;. that stuff happens. But you should never have a lack of effort. It is simply inexcusable at this level.</p>

<p>This is straight up the main reason I cannot hold Luka in the same vein as the upper echelon of superstars like Jokic and Giannis. Luka&rsquo;s as worthless and exploitable on defense as Gobert is on offense. And that is a really low bar.</p>

      <label for="l80oz90" class="commentText"><p>But even in Adam Silver’s league it still is, we’re actively watching Luka have the fact that he is not a good defensive player get exposed. People just think defense isn’t important because it’s tough to quantify, and the only box score stats that do quantify it (stocks) do that poorly, along with the fact that those defensive weaknesses can be much less noticeable in a better matchup.</p>

<p>Not playing defense is fine in the regular season, but we see year after year that it becomes a problem in the playoffs when teams will scheme around exploiting all the flaws in someone’s game. It’s the same thing with heliocentric basketball not being as effective when teams have 7 games to figure out how to shut 1 guy down. Doesn’t mean a team can’t win with a poor defender or a heliocentric offense, but they both can become major disadvantages.</p>

Its just easier to have a guard come down from the perimeter to grab the board and start the break than it is to have a big grab a contested rebound off a box out. This is especially true now that there aren&rsquo;t many true bigs and teams use middle-aged swingmen as PFs</p>

      <label for="l83cjwb" class="commentText"><p>This is reductive reasoning though you could say this about literally any player.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He only scores because he shoots&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He only gets assists because he passes&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He only gets rebounds because he grabs the ball&rsquo;</p>

<p>Usage rate has nothing to do with assists, usage rate is more an indicator of scoring and turnovers as it tracks how many possessions end with a player. If you want to make this argument look at his touches per game and how that stacks up to others in the assists leaderboard.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Like he&rsquo;s making the pass to the shot&rsquo; thats literally what an assist is. A lot of playmaking at the nba level is pulling defenders on a drive or a screen and making the pass. Lebron, Trae, Harden, Jokic, Haliburton all do exactly this multiple times a game and I don&rsquo;t see many argue they are not some of the best playmakers in the league. Even Tatum last game got so many assists because of the Mavs collapsing to stop him and him &lsquo;making the pass to the shot&rsquo;</p>

      <label for="l80kvkl" class="commentText"><p>It has been a weird playoff run from him in terms of what we have asked him to do. He is basically playing point forward with an emphasis on creating for his very good teammates and then battling a center on defense.</p>

<p>Prior to this year he was still kinda a Point forward, but with a heavy lean towards creating for himself first (because we were not as deep offensively), and on defense he kinda just guarded who you expected him to.</p>

<p>It is very interesting schematically and makes sense, but I do wonder if it is part of why Tatum has been out of his scoring rhythm.</p>

<p>Just this year, he averaged 8.1 rebounds, but only a pretty pathetic 18.3% of them were contested, lowest of any player averaging at least 6 rebounds. Luka was second lowest at 20.7% of 9.2 rebounds. Contrast that with the playoffs — Luka’s rebounding numbers are essentially identical (9.7 rebounds, 20.5% contested), but Tatum is up to 10.3 on a <em>way</em> more respectable 26.1%. Those aren’t exactly elite big man numbers, but they’re <em>very</em> good for a 6’8” wing frequently being paired up with actual centers.</p>

<p>And still battling and leading the team in rebounds while boxing out bigs.</p>

<p>Dude can&rsquo;t hit the ocean with a softball right now.</p>

<p>But he&rsquo;s literally doing everything else at a superstar level. And like many have said, his ability to guard the Mavs bigs is absolutely huge for us. It&rsquo;s allowing KP/Al to play free safety off one of their bad shooters, Jrue/DWhite/JB can rotate Luka and Kyrie&rsquo;s assignment. And everyone plays great help defense. It&rsquo;s incredible to see.</p>

      <label for="l837wqd" class="commentText"><p>yeah it&rsquo;s almost like Tatum is expending all his energy doing everything required to win a championship and as a result he doesn&rsquo;t quite have his legs for shooting.</p>

<p>Whereas Luka, who is going up against 1v1 mostly, is expelling all his energy trying to find some offense for Dallas and then taking every defensive possession off to catch his breathe.  Likewise for Kyrie who is just trying to go iso against elite defense and has nothing else of value to add beyond that.</p>

<p>Tatum is having a brilliant Finals in spite of the shooting.  Reminds me a lot of Larry Bird&rsquo;s first championship where he didn&rsquo;t crack 20 points until the final game.  There were back to back games where he went 3-11 with 8 points followed by a 5-16 performance with 12 points.  But it didn&rsquo;t matter.  Bird was finding ways to win and Maxwell (who won Finals MVP) was getting buckets off the attention Bird was getting.  It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;do whatever it takes&rdquo; mentality.  Unselfish team basketball.  Tatum should be celebrated for how he&rsquo;s approaching these games.</p>

It flips in the playoffs but I watch almost every regular season game of the Tatum era. He’ll grab the easy rebounds and get his numbers. But, he can fight for big ones like you’ve been seeing. He’s definitely mindful about when he puts certain types of energy into play. Like how he’s pretty clear that he will never try to get charges, will not attempt. I think he doesn’t like to exert the body in certain ways to keep his health, which pays off for us Celtics fans because we’ve been able to rely on our #1 option for years without worrying if he’ll be healthy or available</p>

<p>So many guys in the league are heliocentric with high usage rates surrounded by three point shooters, no duh they&rsquo;ll get a lot of assists. Plus the official box score keepers nowadays are very lenient when it comes to crediting players with assists.</p>

<p>Also with all the long rebounds from three point shooting, teams mostly not going for offensive rebounds to get back in transition, and that boxing out stat shows there&rsquo;s not a lot of effort that goes into grabbing 90% of rebounds</p>

Luka is a stat stuffer and an absolute cone on defense for most of the game but I’m talking him over anyone in this series. </p>

      <label for="l8174ek" class="commentText"><p>I used JB instead because I see him as a better defender than JT. Put Tatum on the Mavs in place of Luka. I don’t think they’re in the finals. For as good as Tatum is, he’s not unguardable (if that’s a word) like Luka was/is. Tatum has played good but he’s also playing with great defenders and great 3 point shooters. The Mavs have 3 guys starting that are average or below average 3 point shooters. I’d like to see Tatum play make when the court isn’t as spread out and 3 guys are in the paint waiting for you. I’m not even a Mavs or Luka fan but the comparing anyone on the Celtics to Luka as a better player is crazy. For as good as some of these defenders are, the game is still about putting the ball in the hoop. Gobert is a 4x DPOY and he isn’t 1/10th of the player Jokic is. </p>

<p>Luka&rsquo;s steps on playing defense:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>get switched onto a ballhandler like Brown or Tatum</p></li>

<li><p>immediately either get blown by or gamble on a steal and be out of position, and then defense behind has to scramble and rotate, leaving someone open for a shot</p></li>

<li><p>stand around watching the ball instead of sprinting to help the help defense and contest a shot</p></li>

I can&rsquo;t think of any player up there who didn&rsquo;t at least try on defense occasionally lol. And most of em were just straight up elite at points in their career. I guess Magic wasn&rsquo;t amazing so I&rsquo;ve heard but I find it hard to believe he still wasn&rsquo;t more passable than whatever Luka is. He&rsquo;s downright embarrassing on that end in the Finals of all times.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fine if this is what he wants to do, he&rsquo;s good enough to &ldquo;deserve&rdquo; that, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s some insane expectation to expect him to try on defense a little either. It&rsquo;s a valid criticism.</p>

<p>Prime Lebron didn&rsquo;t take breaks though and carried an a much worse team to the finals. A lot of people forget Lebron was like 1st team defense and all NBA first team for like 5 or 6 years straight in his prime.</p>

      <label for="l82i8of" class="commentText"><p>I get it, it looks funny in this one and Luka definitely has a habit of giving up defensively, BUT this particular play was just coverage confusion by both Mavs. Luka expected a switch but his teammate was in Smack coverage, bodying up the screener to essentially take him out of the play as a scoring threat (hard to Roll or Pop when someone is literally hanging all over you) and allow Luka to go under and get back in front of the ball handler. The screener even makes a heads up play and Theis screens his own man so it makes the play look even clunkier</p>

Everyone knows a team has a heirarchy, that&rsquo;s expected and happens. But to see your best player basically say &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; on defense and then dominate the ball on offense&hellip;it just can&rsquo;t be fun to play with. Obviously everything is fine when you&rsquo;re winning, but frustration builds up otherwise.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a way of saying &ldquo;yeah I&rsquo;m kinda above this, deal with it&rdquo;, but just more subconsciously instead of directly. And I don&rsquo;t at all think he&rsquo;s a bad teammate/locker room guy, but there&rsquo;s just no shot some teammates aren&rsquo;t pissed about that lack of effort.</p>

He&rsquo;s injured in like 3 spots, tired from being the only competent ball handler and shot creator (you don&rsquo;t understand how much of a burden this is), and he&rsquo;s playing against this stacked Celtics roster. His teammates are shit he&rsquo;s not about to waste the bit of energy he has on guarding. Is it stupid? Yeah. But he legit gets no time to rest on offense. All superstars have had to sacrifice in ways to get their rest. He doesn&rsquo;t have the privilege Tatum has.</p>

You can make all the excuses you want for the guy, but the fact is that he is a defensive liability. And if I had to guess why, I&rsquo;d guess that it&rsquo;s because of his conditioning.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still far and away the best scorer on the court. I&rsquo;d say in the entire league. But he&rsquo;s not perfect, and the gaps in his game are not about ability. They are about effort.</p>

<p>You think Kobe played every game gassed just because he had to play D? Michael Jordan? We going into a statistical analysis of their usage rates too?</p>

<p>At some point, there&rsquo;s a realization that Luka is an ALL TIME great offensively and he should work a lot harder on his conditioning. Defensively, he could be a lot better if he put in the work. With someone that talented with his ability and potential, that&rsquo;s the aspect of his game that he needs to improve on the most. That&rsquo;s what all the greats do. They improve their game in the ways in which they are lacking.</p>

<p>And yeah, easy to say from my couch, but I live in a world where these guys get paid what they do because I and millions of others around the world engage with the NBA. But maybe these games should be played in private and only other NBA players should be allowed to comment and discuss other players. We can just get stenographer transcripts of the games after they&rsquo;re played and no one will ever have any criticism of Luka ever again.</p>

      <label for="l813n6p" class="commentText"><p>I’m the biggest Bron fan there is but I can admit that one of the reasons the Lakers lost some of those games against the Nuggets was because of his unwillingness to box out. He let Gordon jump over his back a number of times that led to 3’s every time. To his benefit, he is 40 and was probably dog tired from having to do so much with DLO, Rui, and Reaves playing like trash. </p>

      <label for="l82vula" class="commentText"><p>If Payton Pritchard had Luka&rsquo;s offensive talent, he&rsquo;d rarely be in a position to even go up for offensive rebounds. He mostly grabs uncontested rebounds and that&rsquo;s by design. He&rsquo;s the team&rsquo;s primary shot creator from the perimeter, how would he even be inside the paint fighting for offensive rebounds? Makes much more sense to criticize him always getting blown by. If he could even be half decent there, the Celtics would get far fewer uncontested 3s.</p>

      <label for="l827jpa" class="commentText"><p>A box out is not the same thing as a contested rebound. You&rsquo;re conflating the two. Luka may have fewer box outs than some other guards, but he averages 2 contested rebounds per game in the playoffs, which is competitive with other guards:</p>

<ul>
<li>Luka Doncic: 2.0 per game</li>
<li>Jrue Holiday: 1.9 per game</li>
<li>Donovan Mitchell: 1.4 per game</li>
<li>Russell Westbrook: 1.2 per game</li>
<li>Kyrie Irving: 1.0 per game</li>
<li>Haywood Highsmith: 1.0 per game</li>
<li>CJ McCollum: 1.0 per game</li>
<li>Devin Booker: 0.8 per game</li>
<li>Kyle Lowry: 0.7 per game</li>
</ul>

<p>This indicates that Luka is actively engaging in rebounding battles, even if his box out numbers are lower.</p>

<p>Your claim that Luka relies on uncontested rebounds, unlike smaller guards, has been decisively debunked.</p>

      <label for="l82lgp7" class="commentText"><p>Exactly! If you actually pay attention to his boards vs stats you can see he is actually a good/great rebounder for his position. Sticky hands and often wrestling off bigs to secure them. Box out is flawed for guards. He doesn’t rotate that well for sure, but when a shot is flying from the opposite side he is very good at offering an extra body to control the glass.</p>

      <label for="l8094kc" class="commentText"><p>No I can understand that. This was more to show that raw rebounding numbers can be misleading.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the issues with the &ldquo;heliocentric&rdquo; or &ldquo;ball dominant&rdquo; team style. Luka is an incredible player, one of the greatest offensive talents we&rsquo;ve seen and a future all time great.</p>

<p>But because he&rsquo;s asked to do so much offensively he can be tired out by the second half. Last night he legit couldn&rsquo;t miss in the first half and then in the second half he fell off. He got Pritchard on him on back to back possessions and missed comfortable looks for him.</p>

<p>Thats where Kyrie is supposed to come in, but he&rsquo;s just been ass lol.</p>

<p>Luka has his warts. Slow foot speed on defense has been a big issue his whole career, and he got beat a lot last night. But he&rsquo;s also the only reason the Mavericks were even in the game. They missed so many open 3&rsquo;s, Kyrie couldn&rsquo;t create for shit so Luka&rsquo;s tough shot making was the only thing they had working (that and the Celtics missing everything).</p>

<p>Dallas really needs a tertiary creator and a real stretch big as their two biggest priorities this offseason regardless of what happens the rest of this series.</p>

Not saying Luka is good or isn’t but the third lowest out of these players is Hart and he’s probably the best rebounder out of the group. I see a lot of people boxing out when they’re smaller in size than the guy they’re competing for the rebound with. Luka is 6’8”, he’s usually much bigger than the guys he’s going against. </p>

Dont play = soft man so many delusional commenters, watching every Luka game its not hard to say he is a very good rebounder and actually has many times he defers the rebound to someone else when he can get it. Yall cherry pick a random stat to prove a certain viewpoint its ridiculous</p>

Look at the Wolves series where they were both good, Luka didn’t have to exert much energy in offense so he was decent on defense and had enough legs to close the 4th.</p>

When you box out, you prevent the person you are boxing out from making a play on the ball. You are giving yourself inside position to go to where you predict the ball will go. If they go through you or over you, it’s a foul.</p>

      <label for="l8249wq" class="commentText"><p>Not to deny that Luka doesnt box out, but given that a big chunk of that list are apparently boxing out more than Hart, a guy who averaged 11.5 rebounds a game, I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and say that this data is pretty flawed. Especially when you consider who a lot of these spend their time guarding, Jrue/Highsmith/Lowry/Hart spend a lot time guarding big wings because of how it allows them to help/switch. The other guards, the less defensively capable ones are spending a lot of their time stashed away in the corner and their jobs are often to show help on drives and help gang rebound, which affords them a lot more opportunities to box out.</p>

<p>Edit: As for Westbrook - yes, a lot of his defensive rebounds are typical “let the point guard get it” rebounds, which is just smart game management. However, he is an elite offensive rebounder for his size, which requires strength, timing, and athleticism.</p>

Remember nobody gave us a chance to make the finals, a lot of people even said we won&rsquo;t make the playoffs. So Luka actually exeeded expectations again, but yet most of the thing I read is &ldquo;he needs to be much better&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Box out stats don&rsquo;t really matter without a context. Maybe his role is not to box out, but to get a rebound. Maybe he&rsquo;s not in a position to box out&hellip; does he sometimes get beat for a rebound, because he doesn&rsquo;t box out? Sure, but it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s consistently happening. Remember, the Mavs won rebounding battle most of the time in these playoffs so far. So I think what they (and Luka) are doing is just fine.</p>

      <label for="l80qz79" class="commentText"><p>The idea is everyone else boxes out to allow Luka to get the rebound because who do you want to initiate a potential fast break. Hence why Kyrie&rsquo;s numbers are low also.</p>

<p>This is by design, not lack of effort. Stat redditors read a stat without first giving any thought to context and why that may be and instead always resort to he is the best or he is the worst narratives.  Tatum is not the playmaker Doncic is to be able to spring a player free upcourt, comparing the two on boxout numbers is so goddamn dumb.</p>
