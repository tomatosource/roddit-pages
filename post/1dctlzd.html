      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dctlzd/despite_averaging_97_rebounds_per_game_in_the/"><p>Despite averaging 9.7 rebounds per game in the playoffs (10th), Luka Doncic has 0.3 box outs per game (68th out of players that average at least 25 mins). Kyrie Irving averages twice as many box outs, and Jayson Tatum has more box outs in 2 finals games than Luka all playoffs.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?CF=MIN*GE*25&amp;PORound=0&amp;PerMode=PerGame" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>Now Luka is a guard, so it makes sense that he averages a low amount of box outs. However other, smaller guards (that don&rsquo;t get nearly as many boards) still rank above him this postseason.</p>

<ul>
<li>Luka Doncic has 0.3 per game</li>
<li>Kyrie Irving has 0.6 per game</li>
<li>Jrue Holiday has 1.1 per game</li>
<li>Donovan Mitchell had 1.3 per game</li>
<li>Devin Booker had 1.5 per game</li>
<li>Haywood Highsmith had 1.4 per game</li>
<li>Kyle Lowry had 1.3 per game</li>
<li>CJ McCollum had 1.0 per game</li>
<li>Josh Hart had 0.9 per game</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?PerMode=Totals&amp;PORound=4" target="_blank">Jayson Tatum has had 8 box outs across 2 finals games</a> and <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Doncic&amp;PORound=0&amp;PerMode=Totals" target="_blank">Luka Doncic has had 6 box outs over 19 playoff games</a>.</p>

<p>Not all rebounds are created equal. Luka gets a lot of the classic Westbrook uncontested rebounds. For example, in 2017-18 (the first year box outs were tracked) Westbrook averaged 10.1 rebounds per game but had <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*westbrook&amp;PORound=0&amp;PerMode=PerGame&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season" target="_blank">0.9 box outs per game</a>.</p>

      <label for="l80905b" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t fathom why Kidd isn&rsquo;t on Luka&rsquo;s ass about this.</p>

<p>A coach like Pop would call a timeout 2 minutes into a game if his star did stupid shit like this and chew his ass out in front of the team.</p>

<p>Stars gotta hold themselves accountable. You can miss shots, not execute plays well, make mistakes in assignments or bad fouls &hellip;. that stuff happens. But you should never have a lack of effort. It is simply inexcusable at this level.</p>

<p>This is straight up the main reason I cannot hold Luka in the same vein as the upper echelon of superstars like Jokic and Giannis. Luka&rsquo;s as worthless and exploitable on defense as Gobert is on offense. And that is a really low bar.</p>

      <label for="l80oz90" class="commentText"><p>But even in Adam Silver’s league it still is, we’re actively watching Luka have the fact that he is not a good defensive player get exposed. People just think defense isn’t important because it’s tough to quantify, and the only box score stats that do quantify it (stocks) do that poorly, along with the fact that those problems can be much less noticeable in a better matchup.</p>

<p>Not playing defense is fine in the regular season, but we see year after year that it becomes a problem in the playoffs when teams will scheme around exploiting all the flaws in someone’s game. It’s the same thing with heliocentric basketball not being as effective when teams have 7 games to figure out how to shut 1 guy down. Doesn’t mean a team can’t win with a poor defender or a heliocentric offense, but they both can become major disadvantages.</p>

<p>Luka is completely exploitable by anyone that switches on to him. And he doesn&rsquo;t do shit in help defense. Just watching the play after he gets blown by.</p>

<p>Jokic can get abused by fast guards (most Centers do), but he still does a decent job of playing around it and helping the rest of the team. He&rsquo;s an elite rebounder, has decent hands and positioning, and surprisingly good in defending PnR; he&rsquo;s just slow and has zero verticality.</p>

When Luka is forced to play defense he gives up completely on plays and is extremely exploitable because of his lack of endurance. Effort isnt everything on defense, but it can make a massive difference in being &ldquo;meh&rdquo; and being an absolute cone.</p>

<p>Part of this is that he&rsquo;s banged up; this is playoffs, lot of people are banged up. No excuses. No one gave the 2022 Celtics an excuse for going through a tough path to the Finals where so many players were banged up.</p>

<p>Mavs gotta help Luka on offense though. He&rsquo;s like 80% of their offense so far and doing all he can by himself.</p>

He offers exactly zero rim protection. This is not a slander to Jokic as he is still a generational player, something that Tatum would never be despite the fact that he is better than both on defence.</p>

<p>Also, let&rsquo;s not forget that Luka does not have 4 all-around great offensive players on his roster to carry some of his load like Tatum. Luka needs to consistently set up DJJ, Lively and PJ.</p>

<p>It is incredible how salty you are considering that you are on the verge of winning a championship, and that Luka made the finals with the likes of DJJ, PJ, Kleber, Green, a rookie C etc, while your boy lost to Jimmy, Bam and a bunch of G-leaguers, when he had &ldquo;just&rdquo; an insane roster around him and not a historic one.</p>

<p>Just give him his props man.</p>

<p>Jokic on defense:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>way more effort</p></li>

<li><p>better rebounder</p></li>

<li><p>better positioning</p></li>

<li><p>better BBIQ</p></li>

<li><p>better help defense</p></li>

<li><p>equal post defense</p></li>

<li><p>way better perimeter defense</p></li>

<li><p>slightly better blocker (just by default though due to his height, neither is good at blocking)</p></li>

<li><p>way, way, way, way better at boxing out (Luka literally does not box out)</p></li>

<li><p>much better at closing out and contesting shots</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I give Luka all the props in the world. He&rsquo;s a generationally talented offensive player, and this sub was downvoting me for saying that 2024 Luka is better offensively than Prime Bron. But Luka&rsquo;s worthless defense is a huge negative that he needs to fix. He&rsquo;s absolutely carried this Mavs team in an incredibly impressive Finals run, no doubt. He&rsquo;s the best player in the Finals. That&rsquo;s how good he is offensively.</p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t something he&rsquo;s only doing now that he&rsquo;s hurt. Luka&rsquo;s always played perimeter defense with low effort. He&rsquo;s comfortable in the post when getting backed down because he can use his strength and size. But any time he has to slide his feet or sprint to the other corner to help? &hellip; he rarely does it.</p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t seem to go any further than the Westbrook uncontested rebound controversy back in his triple double years but in general raw rebound totals tell you next to nothing about how well a guard actually contributes to team rebounding</p>

<p>Luka could average 33/1/9 instead of 33/9/9 and he&rsquo;d still be ranked exactly the same for me</p>

<p>Our team rebounding as a whole went up with Westbrook yearly and there were years were he was near the top of the league in rebounding deflections.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why people have adopted this belief that uncontested rebounds just mean nothing lol, if you are in position for a uncontested rebound, that doesn’t guarantee that your team would have gotten the board regardless. There is <em>some</em> impact for sure.</p>

      <label for="l80lo3e" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not even cheating. Its just easier to have a guard come down from the perimeter to grab the board and start the break than it is to have a big grab a contested rebound off a box out. This is especially true now that there aren&rsquo;t many true bigs and teams use middle-aged swingmen as PFs</p>

      <label for="l80kvkl" class="commentText"><p>It has been a weird playoff run from him in terms of what we have asked him to do. He is basically playing point forward with an emphasis on creating for his very good teammates and then battling a center on defense.</p>

<p>Prior to this year he was still kinda a Point forward, but with a heavy lean towards creating for himself first (because we were not as deep offensively), and on defense he kinda just guarded who you expected him to.</p>

<p>It is very interesting schematically and makes sense, but I do wonder if it is part of why Tatum has been out of his scoring rhythm.</p>

      <label for="l80dgfj" class="commentText"><p>His rebounding numbers always pick up in the playoffs (with the exception of the ‘22 Finals run, weirdly). Goes from a 7 RPG guy to a consistent double-double, and it’s not just about the minutes</p>

<p>Just this year, he averaged 8.1 rebounds, but only a pretty pathetic 18.3% of them were contested, lowest of any player averaging at least 6 rebounds. Luka was second lowest at 20.7% of 9.2 rebounds. Contrast that with the playoffs — Luka’s rebounding numbers are essentially identical (9.7 rebounds, 20.5% contested), but Tatum is up to 10.3 on a <em>way</em> more respectable 26.1%. Those aren’t exactly elite big man numbers, but they’re <em>very</em> good for a 6’8” wing frequently being paired up with actual centers.</p>

<p>And still battling and leading the team in rebounds while boxing out bigs.</p>

<p>Dude can&rsquo;t hit the ocean with a softball right now.</p>

<p>But he&rsquo;s literally doing everything else at a superstar level. And like many have said, his ability to guard the Mavs bigs is absolutely huge for us. It&rsquo;s allowing KP/Al to play free safety off one of their bad shooters, Jrue/DWhite/JB can rotate Luka and Kyrie&rsquo;s assignment. And everyone plays great help defense. It&rsquo;s incredible to see.</p>

The contested percentage as someone else cited goes way up for him in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l8094kc" class="commentText"><p>No I can understand that. This was more to show that raw rebounding numbers can be misleading.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the issues with the &ldquo;heliocentric&rdquo; or &ldquo;ball dominant&rdquo; team style. Luka is an incredible player, one of the greatest offensive talents we&rsquo;ve seen and a future all time great.</p>

<p>But because he&rsquo;s asked to do so much offensively he can be tired out by the second half. Last night he legit couldn&rsquo;t miss in the first half and then in the second half he fell off. He got Pritchard on him on back to back possessions and missed comfortable looks for him.</p>

<p>Thats where Kyrie is supposed to come in, but he&rsquo;s just been ass lol.</p>

<p>Luka has his warts. Slow foot speed on defense has been a big issue his whole career, and he got beat a lot last night. But he&rsquo;s also the only reason the Mavericks were even in the game. They missed so many open 3&rsquo;s, Kyrie couldn&rsquo;t create for shit so Luka&rsquo;s tough shot making was the only thing they had working (that and the Celtics missing everything).</p>

<p>Dallas really needs a tertiary creator and a real stretch big as their two biggest priorities this offseason regardless of what happens the rest of this series.</p>

      <label for="l80qz79" class="commentText"><p>The idea is everyone else boxes out to allow Luka to get the rebound because who do you want to initiate a potential fast break. Hence why Kyrie&rsquo;s numbers are low also.</p>

<p>This is by design, not lack of effort. Stat redditors read a stat without first giving any thought to context and why that may be and instead always resort to he is the best or he is the worst narratives.  Tatum is not the playmaker Doncic is to be able to spring a player free upcourt, comparing the two on boxout numbers is so goddamn dumb.</p>

<p>Edit: As for Westbrook - yes, a lot of his defensive rebounds are typical “let the point guard get it” rebounds, which is just smart game management. However, he is an elite offensive rebounder for his size, which requires strength, timing, and athleticism.</p>

      <label for="l80axep" class="commentText"><p>Lol, you don&rsquo;t think Tatum is the shit fine. But its irritated me all year that people think Luka is top tier. He is a box score bitch, that is good at a couple things (elite jump shooting, top 5 passing, and he&rsquo;s patient) and completely abandons every part of the game that doesn&rsquo;t directly effect his personal line on the box score. Even after this game, when he was trying to be humble by acknowledging his mistakes, he only mentioned the missed free throws and the turnovers, because those are on the box score. He didn&rsquo;t even mention the total joke that was his defense, which cost them the game. You want to put Tatum firmly in the SGA/Ant tier, fine, I&rsquo;m telling you I don&rsquo;t think Luka is in that tier. Doesn&rsquo;t box out, doesn&rsquo;t give help, doesn&rsquo;t set screens, doesn&rsquo;t hold down his man off-ball, and he doesn&rsquo;t even recognize when someone else has a better matchup (like PJ in this series) and just give them a ball. No if they score he has to at least be getting an assist.</p>

<p>Luka is such a box score bitch, that he literally made the finals with DJJ, PJ and a rookie center. Yes, Luka is not a good defender nor an off-ball player, but if he was he would basically be MJ tier. Please, start hating him when/if he does not win with a team as stacked as the Celtics have been for the past couple of years.</p>
