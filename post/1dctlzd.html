      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dctlzd/despite_averaging_97_rebounds_per_game_in_the/"><p>Despite averaging 9.7 rebounds per game in the playoffs (10th), Luka Doncic has 0.3 box outs per game (68th out of players that average at least 25 mins). Kyrie Irving averages twice as many box outs, and Jayson Tatum has more box outs in 2 finals games than Luka all playoffs.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?CF=MIN*GE*25&amp;PORound=0&amp;PerMode=PerGame" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>Now Luka is a guard, so it makes sense that he averages a low amount of box outs. However other, smaller guards (that don&rsquo;t get nearly as many boards) still rank above him this postseason.</p>

<ul>
<li>Luka Doncic has 0.3 per game</li>
<li>Kyrie Irving has 0.6 per game</li>
<li>Jrue Holiday has 1.1 per game</li>
<li>Donovan Mitchell had 1.3 per game</li>
<li>Devin Booker had 1.5 per game</li>
<li>Haywood Highsmith had 1.4 per game</li>
<li>Kyle Lowry had 1.3 per game</li>
<li>CJ McCollum had 1.0 per game</li>
<li>Josh Hart had 0.9 per game</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?PerMode=Totals&amp;PORound=4" target="_blank">Jayson Tatum has had 8 box outs across 2 finals games</a> and <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Doncic&amp;PORound=0&amp;PerMode=Totals" target="_blank">Luka Doncic has had 6 box outs over 19 playoff games</a>.</p>

<p>Not all rebounds are created equal. Luka gets a lot of the classic Westbrook uncontested rebounds. For example, in 2017-18 (the first year box outs were tracked) Westbrook averaged 10.1 rebounds per game but had <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*westbrook&amp;PORound=0&amp;PerMode=PerGame&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season" target="_blank">0.9 box outs per game</a>.</p>

<p>A coach like Pop would call a timeout 2 minutes into a game if his star did stupid shit like this and chew his ass out in front of the team.</p>

<p>Stars gotta hold themselves accountable. You can miss shots, not execute plays well, make mistakes in assignments or bad fouls &hellip;. that stuff happens. But you should never have a lack of effort. It is simply inexcusable at this level.</p>

<p>This is straight up the main reason I cannot hold Luka in the same vein as the upper echelon of superstars like Jokic and Giannis. Luka&rsquo;s as worthless and exploitable on defense as Gobert is on offense. And that is a really low bar.</p>

      <label for="l80km2x" class="commentText"><p>No, the difference between Luka and Jokic is that Jokic isn&rsquo;t completely worthless on defense. He&rsquo;s not a great defender, but he&rsquo;s passable. Decent BBIQ and actually exerts effort.</p>

<p>Luka is completely exploitable by anyone that switches on to him. And he doesn&rsquo;t do shit in help defense. Just watching the play after he gets blown by.</p>

<p>Jokic can get abused by fast guards (most Centers do), but he still does a decent job of playing around it and helping the rest of the team.</p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t something he&rsquo;s only doing now that he&rsquo;s hurt. Luka&rsquo;s always played perimeter defense with low effort. He&rsquo;s comfortable in the post when getting backed down because he can use his strength and size. But any time he has to slide his feet or sprint to the other corner to help? &hellip; he rarely does it.</p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t seem to go any further than the Westbrook uncontested rebound controversy back in his triple double years but in general raw rebound totals tell you next to nothing about how well a guard actually contributes to team rebounding</p>

<p>Luka could average 33/1/9 instead of 33/9/9 and he&rsquo;d still be ranked exactly the same for me</p>

<p>Our team rebounding as a whole went up with Westbrook yearly and there were years were he was near the top of the league in rebounding deflections.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why people have adopted this belief that uncontested rebounds just mean nothing lol, if you are in position for a uncontested rebound, that doesn’t guarantee that your team would have gotten the board regardless. There is <em>some</em> impact for sure.</p>

      <label for="l80kvkl" class="commentText"><p>It has been a weird playoff run from him in terms of what we have asked him to do. He is basically playing point forward with an emphasis on creating for his very good teammates and then battling a center on defense.</p>

<p>Prior to this year he was still kinda a Point forward, but with a heavy lean towards creating for himself first (because we were not as deep offensively), and on defense he kinda just guarded who you expected him to.</p>

<p>It is very interesting schematically and makes sense, but I do wonder if it is part of why Tatum has been out of his scoring rhythm.</p>

<p>Just this year, he averaged 8.1 rebounds, but only a pretty pathetic 18.3% of them were contested, lowest of any player averaging at least 6 rebounds. Luka was second lowest at 20.7% of 9.2 rebounds. Contrast that with the playoffs — Luka’s rebounding numbers are essentially identical (9.7 rebounds, 20.5% contested), but Tatum is up to 10.3 on a <em>way</em> more respectable 26.1%. Those aren’t exactly elite big man numbers, but they’re <em>very</em> good for a 6’8” wing frequently being paired up with actual centers.</p>

<p>And still battling and leading the team in rebounds while boxing out bigs.</p>

<p>Dude can&rsquo;t hit the ocean with a softball right now.</p>

<p>But he&rsquo;s literally doing everything else at a superstar level. And like many have said, his ability to guard the Mavs bigs is absolutely huge for us. It&rsquo;s allowing KP/Al to play free safety off one of their bad shooters, Jrue/DWhite/JB can rotate Luka and Kyrie&rsquo;s assignment. And everyone plays great help defense. It&rsquo;s incredible to see.</p>

<li><p>immediately either get blown by or gamble on a steal and be out of position, and then defense behind has to scramble and rotate, leaving someone open for a shot</p></li>

      <label for="l80g3wu" class="commentText"><p>PPG (paired with efficiency of course) and defense are BY FAR the two most important categories that should be used to judge players nowadays.</p>

<p>So many guys in the league are heliocentric with high usage rates surrounded by three point shooters, no duh they&rsquo;ll get a lot of assists. Plus the official box score keepers nowadays are very lenient when it comes to crediting players with assists.</p>

<p>Also with all the long rebounds from three point shooting, teams mostly not going for offensive rebounds to get back in transition, and that boxing out stat shows there&rsquo;s not a lot of effort that goes into grabbing 90% of rebounds</p>

<p>Elite two way players &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the stat stuffers</p>

      <label for="l8094kc" class="commentText"><p>No I can understand that. This was more to show that raw rebounding numbers can be misleading.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the issues with the &ldquo;heliocentric&rdquo; or &ldquo;ball dominant&rdquo; team style. Luka is an incredible player, one of the greatest offensive talents we&rsquo;ve seen and a future all time great.</p>

<p>But because he&rsquo;s asked to do so much offensively he can be tired out by the second half. Last night he legit couldn&rsquo;t miss in the first half and then in the second half he fell off. He got Pritchard on him on back to back possessions and missed comfortable looks for him.</p>

<p>Thats where Kyrie is supposed to come in, but he&rsquo;s just been ass lol.</p>

<p>Luka has his warts. Slow foot speed on defense has been a big issue his whole career, and he got beat a lot last night. But he&rsquo;s also the only reason the Mavericks were even in the game. They missed so many open 3&rsquo;s, Kyrie couldn&rsquo;t create for shit so Luka&rsquo;s tough shot making was the only thing they had working (that and the Celtics missing everything).</p>

<p>Dallas really needs a tertiary creator and a real stretch big as their two biggest priorities this offseason regardless of what happens the rest of this series.</p>

<p>Edit: As for Westbrook - yes, a lot of his defensive rebounds are typical “let the point guard get it” rebounds, which is just smart game management. However, he is an elite offensive rebounder for his size, which requires strength, timing, and athleticism.</p>

He is a box score bitch, that is good at a couple things (elite jump shooting, top 5 passing, and he&rsquo;s patient) and completely abandons every part of the game that doesn&rsquo;t directly effect his personal line on the box score. Even after this game, when he was trying to be humble by acknowledging his mistakes, he only mentioned the missed free throws and the turnovers, because those are on the box score. He didn&rsquo;t even mention the total joke that was his defense, which cost them the game. You want to put Tatum firmly in the SGA/Ant tier, fine, I&rsquo;m telling you I don&rsquo;t think Luka is in that tier. Doesn&rsquo;t box out, doesn&rsquo;t give help, doesn&rsquo;t set screens, doesn&rsquo;t hold down his man off-ball, and he doesn&rsquo;t even recognize when someone else has a better matchup (like PJ in this series) and just give them a ball. No if they score he has to at least be getting an assist.</p>

      <label for="l80k0u0" class="commentText"><p>I just don&rsquo;t think Luka is on the same level as Giannis or Jokic. The only two players anybody can say are legitimately better than him.</p>
