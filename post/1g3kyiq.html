      <label for="lrwkv02" class="commentText"><p>The &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; small forward seems like some unobtainable idea for most of the league it seems, even with teams that have their young forward already on the roster. I remember there was a lot of discourse about Keegan Murray not being able to play the 3 on the Kings. What other choices did they have? Kevin Huerter is too thin for the 3 and Harrison Barnes/DeMar are too old.</p>

<p>6&rsquo;7 2-way guys are the most valuable asset in the NBA. There&rsquo;s plenty of teams that have resorted to running bulky 6&rsquo;5 guys trying to compensate (my Pacers included).</p>

      <label for="lrwlrlb" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m rooting for Walker but man he&rsquo;s got a long way to go.</p>

<p>We drafted him as an undersized but extremely jacked 4 - 6&rsquo;6 and 240#. Because our power forward rotation is set in stone with Siakam/Toppin, we&rsquo;re asking him to slim down to play the 3 when most players at that position are in the 210-220# range.</p>

<p>A lot of folks seem to think Mathurin is capable of being a 3 - I&rsquo;m not a fan. He&rsquo;s under 6&rsquo;5. Also if he doesn&rsquo;t improve his defense it doesn&rsquo;t matter what position he&rsquo;ll play because he&rsquo;ll be stuck coming off the bench.</p>

      <label for="lrwwbea" class="commentText"><p>How good is Walker at sliding laterally? Cuz even if he is really big and more of a 4 he could be more of a 4 on O (depending on development of his jumper) with Pascal as more of the 3 on O with his perimeter skills and shot creation. Of course this would require P to shoot better than he has to work on O as his shot has fluctuated a fair bit over time even though he shot a lot better as a Pacer due to a combination of personnel around him and being more of the secondary initiator to Haliburton.</p>

<p>But yeah I think there is the problem for the Pacers where all their SF options are 6&rsquo;5 and while Nesmith has length to make up for it a bit you still don&rsquo;t really have that guy you&rsquo;d want taking the star big wings in the East. Pascal might defend better with less creation load but I still think his best role on D is as this long amoeba-like guy helping and playing free safety than as your point of attack guy.</p>

<p>But to me, Walker physically is a lot like OG (6&rsquo;7 ~240 with a 7&rsquo;2 wingspan) who was that lead perimeter defender beside Pascal and it&rsquo;s up to his lateral speed and if he at least adds a corner 3 for them to be playable together</p>

      <label for="lrwxt6u" class="commentText"><p>His lateral movement needs some improvement but as a whole he&rsquo;s behind the curve defensively and we can only hope that improves with experience.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said for ages that the Pacers really shot themselves in the foot not going for Deni Avdija and nothing has convinced me otherwise.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we do a consolidation trade to go for a bigger wing at the deadline. I don&rsquo;t like this idea, but I&rsquo;ve thrown out Toppin + Mathurin for Cam Johnson for a while. That would allow Walker to slide up into the backup 4 role.</p>

      <label for="lrwz7io" class="commentText"><p>I get why you&rsquo;d do that but I still kinda am high on Mathrin and the ways he brings a different look as a 6th man that I think it might be a mistake to give him up like that. Cam is 6&rsquo;8 but I don&rsquo;t really perceive him as that kind of guy who would be an upgrade guarding big wings over Nesmith who&rsquo;s more solid physically and is a better defender. I think Dorian Finney-Smith is more that kind of guy and I think his asking price may be lower. While his 3 hasn&rsquo;t been as good in Brooklyn I think playing off much better talent in Indy would bring it back up to what he was doing with Luka</p>

<p>Those are all good defensive players. Im sure when you start getting into backup players, the defense gets more suspect, but that’s true for a lot of non-shooting backup bigs as well.</p>

<p>Brook Lopez is maybe the one guy that I could see being available since I think the Bucks have to re-consider the construction of their team with Dame, but i&rsquo;ve seen Bucks fans say his defense has started to slip and I&rsquo;m not sure he fits the warriors&rsquo; system anyway.</p>

<p>Making a big trade this last offseason was the only way left for this warriors team to reasonably contend- now we know they aren&rsquo;t going to, why ditch a young guard with a great outlook?</p>

<p>I never said trade Dray, but trading Podz is shortsighted</p>

<p>Trading dray doesn&rsquo;t make sense unless they are completely blowing it up (which they aren&rsquo;t going to do). I&rsquo;m just high on Podz and I think trading him away is a poor idea.</p>

      <label for="lrws8ti" class="commentText"><p>I feel like there’s way too many hairs being split between what’s a 3 and 4 in today’s NBA. If you’re an athletic wing, you can probably hold up against either of the opposing wings. The issues are when teams try to slot guys who are more like the size of a 2 to be a 3. But an athletic wing like JK? What “3” in the NBA is he going to struggle against? If you just list stars, well anyone is gonna struggle with them. Galaxy braining here if you ask me.</p>

<p>Note — this is all independent of the question of should looney even be the starting 5 over 1) Dray at the 5 or 2) TJD at the 5 (probably what I’d do)</p>

      <label for="lrwu1zl" class="commentText"><p>You are confusing the Warriors with other teams. The dubs run a system where the players slot into a specific role. I&rsquo;ll bet most have no idea what a SF does in the dubs switch heavy system. The SF needs to be able to guard 1 through 4, inside and out, be the primary perimeter help defender, spy extra help for steph, regularly cover 2, and get out to contest 3s. Barnes, iggy, wiggins, etc..  JK has never shown the ability to do any of those things which is why he&rsquo;s a pf in this system. Other teams? He&rsquo;s probably is a SF.</p>

      <label for="lrwxy8h" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think Dray at the 5 for an entire season would be good for his durability at this point even if they close with him there and start that way for the playoffs. I think the question is if Kuminga is disciplined enough on D to have a bigger role there and if his shot is going to be consistent enough for him to work with 2 non shooting bigs at least for pretty big parts of the game</p>

Most NBA coaches are not trotting out a 6&rsquo;6&rdquo;, 235 lb player to guard opposing 5&rsquo;s - Kerr is one of the few guys that thinks that is still a good idea.</p>

      <label for="lrwznra" class="commentText"><p>I mean historically Dray has just been that good at breaking up plays and guarding the rim for it to work. But I think he&rsquo;s both on the wrong side of 30 now to be able to do it on the regular, along with more talented bigs in the league than say 2016 along with Warriors losing a lot of their perimeter talent both on O and D that made it work so well.</p>

It feels like Draymond is probably better at his pod these days than he is at basketball, and that leaves a lot of holes on defense. I’m not even sure what you guys will do against a Wemby or Edey.</p>

      <label for="lrwvb0g" class="commentText"><p>My biggest concern is that Kerr just watched the Celtics win a ring with Horford at center and thought to himslef, &ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t even need Porzingis to win the title&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Kerr had a couple training camp quotes quotes related to Draymond playing the 5 along the lines of &ldquo;9 years ago teams still had big centers that Dray had to guard and now everyone plays fast so its less of an issue&rdquo;&hellip;.   which I just don&rsquo;t think I agree with. Yes, teams are more offensive-minded than ever but they also have bigger, skilled guys that can still either kill you in the post or just overwhelm you on the boards, but also know how to use space (Hartenstein being one example here).</p>

<p>Hopefully Kerr&rsquo;s quotes are some charade where he&rsquo;s just not giving anything away -I personally think this team can be very good but clearly needs to make a move to upgrade its options at the 5.</p>

<p>We lost Klay but added Melton and Hield, and Kuminga&rsquo;s 3 pointer has looked really good this preseason. I could easily see those guys combine for 16+ 3PA per game and collectively average in 38%+.</p>

<p>I will say that TJD is an burgeoning impact player&hellip;.and defensively, Warriors had a fantastic net rating with he and Draymond on the floor together.</p>

      <label for="lrwnw2z" class="commentText"><p>Looney is the only 5 in their rotation, so I don&rsquo;t see why this situation would arise. Most of the time Kuminga will be at 4, with Draymond playing 4 when Kuminga sits and 5 otherwise. Their rest of their bench is pretty small, Melton/Moody/Hield/Anderson/Payton, so it&rsquo;s not like there is someone else to play at 4 (I know they like to play Payton at 4, but that&rsquo;s situational).</p>

<p>If they go big with kuminga/Draymond/Looney the spacing will be bad, 3-point shooting is not good with that group, Kuminga and Dray are OK low volume shooters, but not great spacers.</p>
