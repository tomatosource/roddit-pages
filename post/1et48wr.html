      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1et48wr/could_patrick_ewings_career_have_realistically/"><p>Could Patrick Ewing&rsquo;s career have realistically been redefined by one, singular play? How many others could this apply to?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m Knicks fan. I was recently reading the Knicks sub here on Reddit, and I wound up revisiting &amp; discussing some past sadness with a friend while recounting our 90&rsquo;s team &amp; all the near misses. I was talking about how in Game 6 of the 1994** Finals vs the Houston Rockets, down by 2, John Starks very nearly hit a 3 in the closing seconds of the game -but Hakeem came from out of nowhere and got a small piece of the ball. I still dream about the shot to this day. Starks was absolutely on fire that game and I think everyone thought it was going in - some people back then even said he was fouled on the shot (I really don&rsquo;t know; I was a lad &amp; didn&rsquo;t understand basketball like I do now, &amp; all the old footage we have is so grainy). At the time I wasn&rsquo;t super upset though; we were &lsquo;the better team&rsquo;, were just up 3-2, and I figured we&rsquo;d win game 7&hellip; and, well, the rest is history&hellip;</p>

<p>So I started thinking: how much would that shot going in have affected not only Starks &amp; the whole Knicks, but specifically Patrick Ewing&rsquo;s legacy?</p>

<p>IF that shot goes in: Ewing winds up with a ring, ultimately beating Hakeem in their only head to head playoff match up - to me, it probably changes Ewings legacy drastically. People might not remember, but in that moment the best center in the league was still a debatable argument. Hakeem was a defensive mastermind, yes, but he had not yet won any championships and Ewing was the better scorer; Shaq was not quite Shaq yet; Robinson consistently underperformed in the playoffs - one could argue Ewing was the best center and no one would really refute it. I think if he gets this one, people put him alongside Hakeem, deservedly or not; Hakeem did indeed outplay Ewing that series, and deserved to win. But its &lsquo;ring culture&rsquo;, and people remember who won first and foremost.</p>

<p>So is there anyone else who could&rsquo;ve genuinely had their legacy rewritten by a one shot, or one single play? 2019 Kawhi and that ***long 2 against the Sixers in the Eastern semi finals*? 2016 Kyrie? Wilt Chamberlain stealing a championship from the Russell-era Celtics? It seemed fun to ponder, so I thought I&rsquo;d post&hellip;</p>

<p>*edited to correct semifinals instead of ECF</p>

<p>**1994 finals, not 1995; I&rsquo;m clearly off my game/ doing too much multi-tasking today - mea culpa</p>

<p>***I remembered Kawhi&rsquo;s shot as a 3, not a long 2 - no excuses. Nothing but shame!</p>

      <label for="licuv0f" class="commentText"><p>Yes. Definitely. I always loved Penny, and that Magic team was legit, despite being inexperienced - but Ewing was the kind of player that would&rsquo;ve shut down early Shaq, just like Hakeem did, I believe. The Pacers had Smits, who was good in his own right, but not quite strong enough and definitely not agile/ quick enough to handle that era of Shaq. While Ewing wasn&rsquo;t the defender Hakeem was, he also wasn&rsquo;t a slouch, and was both long and fast - combine that with the old vet mindset, and Shaq just isn&rsquo;t Shaq (back then), which somewhat takes away Penny&rsquo;s effectiveness, as well. Or least that is my &lsquo;Knicks fan&rsquo; take!</p>

<p>Dirk is an absolute legend because Dwyane Wade&rsquo;s shot rimmed out at the end of the game 2 comeback, so the Heat didn&rsquo;t go up 2-0 at which point they likely would have won the series. LeBron was an embarrassment at that point, and then entirely cemented his legacy as an all-time great because Ray Allen hit a 3. Shaq and Kobe finished an all-time great three-peat and Chris Webber was never a winner because Vlade Divac tapped the ball out to Robert Horry. Horry&rsquo;s game winner in game 5 is a big part of why Sheed won&rsquo;t be in the HoF.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very strange when you put any thought into it. </p>

      <label for="liawbdy" class="commentText"><p>I agree 100%. People clown on the Bucks, Nuggets, and even the Celtics this year for not having a super difficult road to the finals or a ring or they got lucky. But that&rsquo;s true for a lot of teams, there&rsquo;s always some luck involved or someone getting hurt. Stuff that the teams usually don&rsquo;t have any impact on, nor did that ask for, but you play who&rsquo;s in front of you. Things happen for a reason; sometimes it&rsquo;s a cool moment or series, like the 2016 finals. Other times, it&rsquo;s sad to see, like the early 2000s kings or the 2018 rockets who had an off night at the worst time possible.</p>

<p>A great player can drag a team to the Finals, but only great teams win the championship.  Barkley, Ewing, Drexler, Kemp/Payton, they showed their superstar value getting their team to the Finals, but they lost to much better teams.</p>

<p>Now if you go your whole career and never even get your team to the Finals then you’re likely more of a star and not a superstar.  Though someone like James Harden certainly makes an argument for even that needing context since he spent most of his career facing off against one of the best dynasties in history.</p>

      <label for="licp601" class="commentText"><p>A lot of what we canonize as greatness or lack thereof just comes down to good or bad RNG, basically. Which is obviously silly.</p>

<p>Though we can never know for sure what would happen, a good thought experiment is to imagine running the history of the NBA over repeatedly, say a million times, with each re-run allowing for random bounces of the ball to go different ways (and random bounces of the lottery balls, for that matter). And then image what the <em>distribution</em> of outcomes over those million different histories would be. Clearly there would be many worlds where Jordan &ldquo;only&rdquo; wins a couple, or LeBron wins a lot more. There would be plenty of worlds where guys like Ewing, Malone, Barkley etc. win one or more titles. And so on.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t know what the distributions would look like, but even a cursory thought about the exercise makes it a lot clearer that the specific outcomes we&rsquo;ve observed in our one single NBA history would not be the final word on judging any players&rsquo; value, not by a long shot. Basically it forces us to admit that things are a lot more complicated than we normally imagine and that we should have more humility and openness in how we judge things.</p>

      <label for="lidnzgm" class="commentText"><p>It’s my biggest knock on people who put Kawhi top 25 all time.</p>

<p>His entire legacy ultimately boils down to: winning FMVP with a super deep Spurs team where he was good, but mostly won it for ‘shutting LBJ down’.</p>

<p>Bullshitting his way off the spurs</p>

<p>Getting supremely lucky with Toronto (the bounce against us, golden state physically collapsing).</p>

<p>Dipping after winning a ring there.</p>

<p>Not doing much with the clippers in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>Yes he was an absolute menace in 2019, best postseason player that year. But he still got stupid lucky. Outside of those two years he hasn’t really done all that much compared to all time greats, I’m sorry, and those two years required things to go his way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a young Kobe Bryant is picked up with the 57th draft pick in the 1998 draft to the NYK, where he learns under the tutelage of a senior Michael Jordan. As soon as Jordan retires, Kobe and Shaq lead the Knicks to another 6 straight championships.</p>

<p>To be clear: Starks was THE MAN. He&rsquo;s my favorite player of all time, and I&rsquo;m certain he gets Finals MVP if that shot goes in. Another related topic: I don&rsquo;t like how people only seem to remember this miss and his poor game 7.

      <label for="liap8gy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, no, I definitely think Starks wins Finals MVP - especially if he hit that shot. He was what kept us in the series, to be honest. People remember that miss and the poor game 7, but he was why we won ANY game that series. Starks would for sure be a legend now.</p>

<p>But Ewing definitely got outplayed by Hakeem (as did everyone that playoffs and the next), for sure; I just think that history would remember Ewing as a winner if that shot went in, and that would make people think of him differently now. He&rsquo;d be a &lsquo;great&rsquo; that got a ring in what is essentially &lsquo;the Jordan era&rsquo; (despite no Jordan that year), winning against his main rival for best center - instead of another very good player that got consistently out played in the playoffs</p>

      <label for="liauwtp" class="commentText"><p>I think the one who gets a huge boost in a sense would be Tim Duncan if Ray Allen misses the iconic corner 3 in game 6 of 2013. Obviously, Timmy was going to be a top 10 player ever at minimum regardless, but it&rsquo;s crazy to think about what the perception around him would&rsquo;ve been if he won that series. A lot of people point to Danny Green getting the Finals MVP, but I think we forget that Timmy had a good argument for it as well. And as someone else commented, I won&rsquo;t go into 2014 since I really think it gets too convoluted. But even if he didn&rsquo;t return to the finals again, he would be 5-0 in the finals, with a 2-0 record against LBJ. And if he got the Finals MVP, he would be a four-time Finals MVP, which would&rsquo;ve put him second all-time behind MJ. He would&rsquo;ve never lost a finals series, and I think his GOAT case gets very interesting after that, especially when you factor in his other accolades, and the fact that he&rsquo;s arguably the best defensive player to ever play, or at least in the conversation. And if he does go back to the finals in 2014 and they still win, then we&rsquo;re talking about another player being 6-0 in the finals, which is usually MJ&rsquo;s claim to fame.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t me saying that Timmy would be the GOAT or number 2 all time guaranteed or anything, but it is interesting to think about how much this would change not only our perspective of him, but LBJ as well.</p>

Could you imagine how much the dialogue around Kobe AND KG would change if either Kobe doesn&rsquo;t pass or Artest doesn&rsquo;t hit the shot? Kobe goes 4-3 in the Finals and is tied with Shaq for rings, while KG is a two-time champion who beat the Phil Jackson/Kobe/Pau Lakers twice in 3 years. The conversation around Kobe vs Shaq arguably becomes more contentious, and KG could see himself on the cusp of being considered a top 10 player all time.</p>

And don&rsquo;t get me wrong; Russell was the man and that Celtics team deserves the praise - especially for all those close victories. But one has to assume there is an element of luck to winning 3 game 7s by a shot.</p>

      <label for="lib6ozw" class="commentText"><p>You should take a look at that play again. That play wasn’t Ainge’s fault. That was 100 percent on Charles Barkley, which Westphal, Barkley, and Ainge all have talked about referring to that play.</p>

<p>Basically, when the Bulls were dribbling the ball up the floor (think it was Scottie but don’t remember off the top of my head), for some inexplicable reason that no one can justify, Charles Barkley went for a pure gamble steal on Pippen that he had no shot at getting.</p>

<p>That put Barkley behind the entire play so the Suns had to play 4 v 5.  As a result, Horace Grant (Barkley’s man) was wide open for a layup. Ainge is completely screwed because now, he has to guard Grant to prevent the wide open layup. But by doing that, he left Paxson wide open for 3, so Grant made the good pass to Paxson for the finals winner.  </p>

<p>Ainge didn’t really do anything wrong. He had to choose between a wide open Grant layup or a wide open Paxson 3. I guess he tried to prevent the layup and hope rotation would come for Paxson’s 3 (which didn’t come) or maybe hope Grant didn’t notice Paxson wide open. Barkley was so behind on the play he couldn’t even get back to contest Paxson’s 3. </p>

<p>The entire play can be found online to prove I’m not just talking nonsense. It’s like one of the worst not talked about defensive plays in NBA history by Barkley because if he doesn’t go for that steal attempt, they probably win the game. It’s not talked about to the point most people think it’s Ainge’s fault. </p>

      <label for="libyeam" class="commentText"><p>I feel like people forget that Ewing didn&rsquo;t play great that series. As you mentioned, Hakeem locked him up defensively, he had like 18 ppg on a super bad 36 FG%. I doubt he would&rsquo;ve won FMVP had Starks made the shot. Your point about &ldquo;ring culture&rdquo; is fair, though; one missed shot shouldn&rsquo;t be the end-all be-all of comparing two players going head to head, especially if the one who wins is the one who played worse.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people on tiktok suggest Lebron&rsquo;s legacy would drastically change if Ray Allen missed his 3, but I think it&rsquo;s very possible the Heat could&rsquo;ve won the following year without having to worry about a Spurs team out for revenge. Certainly worth mentioning, though.</p>

<p>I think the biggest example in my head is Tim Duncan had Big Shot Bob not made that wide open shot in G5 of the 2005 Finals. I have Duncan in my top 5, but had that series against the 2005 Pistons gone slightly different, I can absolutely picture him dropping on my list significantly. Horry&rsquo;s shot that series is arguably the defining moment of that Finals, as it allowed San Antonio to take a 3-2 lead in a series that went to 7 games.</p>

<p>Also want to add that that series really made me question what allegiance to a team means. I loved Clyde the Glide, too, by proxy, and was REALLY hoping for a Rockets/ Bulls final in 95 after Michael came back - because man I couldn&rsquo;t stand Jordan and those 90s Bulls. Especially Pippen. But was rooting hard for the Rockets again once the Knicks were knocked off, despite the year before.</p>

<p>Hakeem did indeed outplay Ewing that series, and deserved to win. But its &lsquo;ring culture&rsquo;, and people remember who won first and foremost.</p>

<p>Thing is, if the Rockets still win in &lsquo;95 (and they beat Orlando, not New York, so I guess why wouldn&rsquo;t they?) Hakeem still has 1 ring a piece with Ewing and played out of his mind in &lsquo;94 even with the loss, I think Hakeem still looks like the best Center from the era regardless.</p>

<p>If he makes that shot at the end of game 6 regulation, would he get finals MVP? What would change about his legacy?</p>

      <label for="lib6a6d" class="commentText"><p>As a lifelong Knicks fan, Ewing was not close to being the best center of the league at any point during the 90&rsquo;s, nor was he considered a better scorer than Hakeem or Robinson.</p>

<p>Ewing was never a top 3 MVP candidate, while Hakeem and Robinson both won MVPs.  They were a clear tier above him for good reason.</p>

      <label for="liavh03" class="commentText"><p>#1 hakeem did not foul starks lol.</p>

<p>#2 the knicks were NOT the better team, its just that in game 7 the refs made both teams play actual basketball instead of that goon shit the knicks had been playing all year</p>

<p>#3 had starks won the game  (would have missed btw) it definitely changes everything because ewing would have beaten hakeem in college and pros as well as the rockets dont play like defending champs the next year and win back to back on PURE GRIT. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE HEART OF A 🏆</p>
