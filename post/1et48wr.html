      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1et48wr/could_patrick_ewings_career_have_realistically/"><p>Could Patrick Ewing&rsquo;s career have realistically been redefined by one, singular play? How many others could this apply to?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m Knicks fan. I was recently reading the Knicks sub here on Reddit, and I wound up revisiting &amp; discussing some past sadness with a friend while recounting our 90&rsquo;s team &amp; all the near misses. I was talking about how in Game 6 of the 1994** Finals vs the Houston Rockets, down by 2, John Starks very nearly hit a 3 in the closing seconds of the game -but Hakeem came from out of nowhere and got a small piece of the ball. I still dream about the shot to this day. Starks was absolutely on fire that game and I think everyone thought it was going in - some people back then even said he was fouled on the shot (I really don&rsquo;t know; I was a lad &amp; didn&rsquo;t understand basketball like I do now, &amp; all the old footage we have is so grainy). At the time I wasn&rsquo;t super upset though; we were &lsquo;the better team&rsquo;, were just up 3-2, and I figured we&rsquo;d win game 7&hellip; and, well, the rest is history&hellip;</p>

<p>So I started thinking: how much would that shot going in have affected not only Starks &amp; the whole Knicks, but specifically Patrick Ewing&rsquo;s legacy?</p>

<p>IF that shot goes in: Ewing winds up with a ring, ultimately beating Hakeem in their only head to head playoff match up - to me, it probably changes Ewings legacy drastically. People might not remember, but in that moment the best center in the league was still a debatable argument. Hakeem was a defensive mastermind, yes, but he had not yet won any championships and Ewing was the better scorer; Shaq was not quite Shaq yet; Robinson consistently underperformed in the playoffs - one could argue Ewing was the best center and no one would really refute it. I think if he gets this one, people put him alongside Hakeem, deservedly or not; Hakeem did indeed outplay Ewing that series, and deserved to win. But its &lsquo;ring culture&rsquo;, and people remember who won first and foremost.</p>

<p>So is there anyone else who could&rsquo;ve genuinely had their legacy rewritten by a one shot, or one single play? 2019 Kawhi and that 3 against the Sixers in the Eastern semi finals*? 2016 Kyrie? Wilt Chamberlain stealing a championship from the Russell-era Celtics? It seemed fun to ponder, so I thought I&rsquo;d post&hellip;</p>

<p>*edited to correct semifinals instead of ECF</p>

<p>**1994 finals, not 1995; I&rsquo;m clearly off my game/ doing too much multi-tasking today - mea culpa</p>

<p>Dirk is an absolute legend because Dwyane Wade&rsquo;s shot rimmed out at the end of the game 2 comeback, so the Heat didn&rsquo;t go up 2-0 at which point they likely would have won the series. LeBron was an embarrassment at that point, and then entirely cemented his legacy as an all-time great because Ray Allen hit a 3. Shaq and Kobe finished an all-time great three-peat and Chris Webber was never a winner because Vlade Divac tapped the ball out to Robert Horry. Horry&rsquo;s game winner in game 5 is a big part of why Sheed won&rsquo;t be in the HoF.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very strange when you put any thought into it. </p>

      <label for="liaw6nm" class="commentText"><p>I always felt leading a team to the Finals is enough of an achievement on a great player’s resume.</p>

<p>A great player can drag a team to the Finals, but only great teams win the championship.  Barkley, Ewing, Drexler, Kemp/Payton, they showed their superstar value getting their team to the Finals, but they lost to much better teams.</p>

<p>Now if you go your whole career and never even get your team to the Finals then you’re likely more of a star and not a superstar.  Though someone like James Harden certainly makes an argument for even that needing context since he spent most of his career facing off against one of the best dynasties in history.</p>

      <label for="liawbdy" class="commentText"><p>I agree 100%. People clown on the Bucks, Nuggets, and even the Celtics this year for not having a super difficult road to the finals or a ring or they got lucky. But that&rsquo;s true for a lot of teams, there&rsquo;s always some luck involved or someone getting hurt. Stuff that the teams usually don&rsquo;t have any impact on, nor did that ask for, but you play who&rsquo;s in front of you. Things happen for a reason; sometimes it&rsquo;s a cool moment or series, like the 2016 finals. Other times, it&rsquo;s sad to see, like the early 2000s kings or the 2018 rockets who had an off night at the worst time possible.</p>

      <label for="liap8gy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, no, I definitely think Starks wins Finals MVP - especially if he hit that shot. He was what kept us in the series, to be honest. People remember that miss and the poor game 7, but he was why we won ANY game that series. Starks would for sure be a legend now.</p>

<p>But Ewing definitely got outplayed by Hakeem (as did everyone that playoffs and the next), for sure; I just think that history would remember Ewing as a winner if that shot went in, and that would make people think of him differently now. He&rsquo;d be a &lsquo;great&rsquo; that got a ring in what is essentially &lsquo;the Jordan era&rsquo; (despite no Jordan that year), winning against his main rival for best center - instead of another very good player that got consistently out played in the playoffs</p>

<p>To be clear: Starks was THE MAN. He&rsquo;s my favorite player of all time, and I&rsquo;m certain he gets Finals MVP if that shot goes in. Another related topic: I don&rsquo;t like how people only seem to remember this miss and his poor game 7. Hakeem was locking up Ewing, and Starks was the reason we were in the series (or that game) at all.</p>

      <label for="liauwtp" class="commentText"><p>I think the one who gets a huge boost in a sense would be Tim Duncan if Ray Allen misses the iconic corner 3 in game 6 of 2013. Obviously, Timmy was going to be a top 10 player ever at minimum regardless, but it&rsquo;s crazy to think about what the perception around him would&rsquo;ve been if he won that series. A lot of people point to Danny Green getting the Finals MVP, but I think we forget that Timmy had a good argument for it as well. And as someone else commented, I won&rsquo;t go into 2014 since I really think it gets too convoluted. But even if he didn&rsquo;t return to the finals again, he would be 5-0 in the finals, with a 2-0 record against LBJ. And if he got the Finals MVP, he would be a four-time Finals MVP, which would&rsquo;ve put him second all-time behind MJ. He would&rsquo;ve never lost a finals series, and I think his GOAT case gets very interesting after that, especially when you factor in his other accolades, and the fact that he&rsquo;s arguably the best defensive player to ever play, or at least in the conversation. And if he does go back to the finals in 2014 and they still win, then we&rsquo;re talking about another player being 6-0 in the finals, which is usually MJ&rsquo;s claim to fame.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t me saying that Timmy would be the GOAT or number 2 all time guaranteed or anything, but it is interesting to think about how much this would change not only our perspective of him, but LBJ as well.</p>

      <label for="liawgcv" class="commentText"><p>I firmly believe that if that shot goes in, then the Knicks obviously are the best team in the NBA. Jordan unretires and joins New York, they rattle off about 5 straight championships. A young Shaq decides he’s tired of losing and joins MJ in New York.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a young Kobe Bryant is picked up with the 57th draft pick in the 1998 draft to the NYK, where he learns under the tutelage of a senior Michael Jordan. As soon as Jordan retires, Kobe and Shaq lead the Knicks to another 6 straight championships.</p>

<p>Hakeem did indeed outplay Ewing that series, and deserved to win. But its &lsquo;ring culture&rsquo;, and people remember who won first and foremost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thing is, if the Rockets still win in &lsquo;95 (and they beat Orlando, not New York, so I guess why wouldn&rsquo;t they?) Hakeem still has 1 ring a piece with Ewing and played out of his mind in &lsquo;94 even with the loss, I think Hakeem still looks like the best Center from the era regardless.</p>

<p>#3 had starks won the game  (would have missed btw) it definitely changes everything because ewing would have beaten hakeem in college and pros as well as the rockets dont play like defending champs the next year and win back to back on PURE GRIT. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE HEART OF A 🏆</p>
