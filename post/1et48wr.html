      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1et48wr/could_patrick_ewings_career_have_realistically/"><p>Could Patrick Ewing&rsquo;s career have realistically been redefined by one, singular play? How many others could this apply to?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m Knicks fan. I was recently reading the Knicks sub here on Reddit, and I wound up revisiting &amp; discussing some past sadness with a friend while recounting our 90&rsquo;s team &amp; all the near misses. I was talking about how in Game 6 of the 1994** Finals vs the Houston Rockets, down by 2, John Starks very nearly hit a 3 in the closing seconds of the game -but Hakeem came from out of nowhere and got a small piece of the ball. I still dream about the shot to this day. Starks was absolutely on fire that game and I think everyone thought it was going in - some people back then even said he was fouled on the shot (I really don&rsquo;t know; I was a lad &amp; didn&rsquo;t understand basketball like I do now, &amp; all the old footage we have is so grainy). At the time I wasn&rsquo;t super upset though; we were &lsquo;the better team&rsquo;, were just up 3-2, and I figured we&rsquo;d win game 7&hellip; and, well, the rest is history&hellip;</p>

<p>So I started thinking: how much would that shot going in have affected not only Starks &amp; the whole Knicks, but specifically Patrick Ewing&rsquo;s legacy?</p>

<p>IF that shot goes in: Ewing winds up with a ring, ultimately beating Hakeem in their only head to head playoff match up - to me, it probably changes Ewings legacy drastically. People might not remember, but in that moment the best center in the league was still a debatable argument. Hakeem was a defensive mastermind, yes, but he had not yet won any championships and Ewing was the better scorer; Shaq was not quite Shaq yet; Robinson consistently underperformed in the playoffs - one could argue Ewing was the best center and no one would really refute it. I think if he gets this one, people put him alongside Hakeem, deservedly or not; Hakeem did indeed outplay Ewing that series, and deserved to win. But its &lsquo;ring culture&rsquo;, and people remember who won first and foremost.</p>

<p>So is there anyone else who could&rsquo;ve genuinely had their legacy rewritten by a one shot, or one single play? 2019 Kawhi and that 3 against the Sixers in the Eastern semi finals*? 2016 Kyrie? Wilt Chamberlain stealing a championship from the Russell-era Celtics? It seemed fun to ponder, so I thought I&rsquo;d post&hellip;</p>

<p>*edited to correct semifinals instead of ECF</p>

<p>**1994 finals, not 1995; I&rsquo;m clearly off my game/ doing too much multi-tasking today - mea culpa</p>

<p>Ray Allen 3 in 2013 somewhat rewrites Duncan’s legacy. If he misses Duncan becomes 6-0 in the finals and 3-0 against Lebron.</p>

      <label for="liap8gy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, no, I definitely think Starks wins Finals MVP - especially if he hit that shot. He was what kept us in the series, to be honest. People remember that miss and the poor game 7, but he was why we won ANY game that series. Starks would for sure be a legend now.</p>

<p>But Ewing definitely got outplayed by Hakeem (as did everyone that playoffs and the next), for sure; I just think that history would remember Ewing as a winner if that shot went in, and that would make people think of him differently now. He&rsquo;d be a &lsquo;great&rsquo; that got a ring in what is essentially &lsquo;the Jordan era&rsquo; (despite no Jordan that year), winning against his main rival for best center - instead of another very good player that got consistently out played in the playoffs</p>

<p>Dirk is an absolute legend because Dwyane Wade&rsquo;s shot rimmed out at the end of the game 2 comeback, so the Heat didn&rsquo;t go up 2-0 at which point they likely would have won the series. LeBron was an embarrassment at that point, and then entirely cemented his legacy as an all-time great because Ray Allen hit a 3. Shaq and Kobe finished an all-time great three-peat and Chris Webber was never a winner because Vlade Divac tapped the ball out to Robert Horry. Horry&rsquo;s game winner in game 5 is a big part of why Sheed won&rsquo;t be in the HoF.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very strange when you put any thought into it. </p>
