    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>There are 27 teams sitting at home right now, wondering what they did wrong. This post will attempt to offer my two cents and my rudimentary <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/two-common-challenges-physicians-face-patients-and-drugs" target="_blank">prescriptions</a> for them, but feel free to contribute your own. What does each team need to do to get on that main stage next year? What should their top priority be?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(1 seed) Oklahoma City Thunder: 57-25 record, lost in round two</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>OKC had a great season and ranked top 5 in both offensive and defensive rating. That said: they had a clear flaw on the glass. They finished the regular season with a -2.7 rebounding differential per game, which is a very poor mark for a good team. They allowed opponents to grab 11.8 <em>offensive</em> rebounds per game, the second highest in the entire NBA.</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>Given that, the most common solution I hear is: the Thunder need size! They need a true big! Jarrett Allen, Zach Edey, whomever. The bigger the better!</p>

<p>I disagree.</p>

<p>The Thunder have developed a clear style of play, attempting to be a true &ldquo;5-out&rdquo; team offensively. That&rsquo;s not just a preference of modern analytics, it&rsquo;s also the preferred style when your star player is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. To be most effective, he needs to slash and score inside &ndash; in the midrange and at the free-throw line. He needs space to do that. Clogging the paint is going to be counter-productive. Sure, acquiring a backup center isn&rsquo;t a bad idea in case of emergency, but it&rsquo;s not the lineup I&rsquo;d strive to normalize.</p>

<p>Instead of going for a 250+ pound center, I&rsquo;d attempt to <strong>acquire a big forward</strong> instead. Someone who can help on the glass and provide some physicality to help Chet Holmgren, but someone who will also still be dynamic and a perimeter-oriented player on offense. Honestly, trading for Gordon Hayward was the right <em>idea,</em> but just the wrong player. We&rsquo;ve heard reports that Hayward wasn&rsquo;t keen to go to OKC. I have some friends in coaching circles, and the grumbling is that Hayward (now 34) isn&rsquo;t particularly keen on playing high-level basketball at all anymore.</p>

<p>But I believe with the right forward, their style of basketball can still work. In a sense, it reminds me of some of Jay Wright&rsquo;s earlier teams at Villanova. The Wildcats were ahead of the curve &ndash; shooting a lot of threes and playing a lot of guards, but they were actually one of the best rebounding teams in the Big East as well. They had bigger, sturdier guards (even dating back to the Randy Foye / Kyle Lowry days) who could help on the glass. It&rsquo;s an understanding that rebounding is a team responsibility 1 through 5. It&rsquo;s also a modern understanding that three-point misses can ricochet further and require more speed and athleticism than rebounds from the 1950s.</p>

<p><strong>(2 seed) Denver Nuggets: 57-25 record, lost in round two</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>The defending champions may have lost to Minnesota, but they have a very good starting lineup 1-5. After that, it gets dicey. Their roster has gotten so thin that Ozempic may hire them as a sponsor. A lot of the blame for that and been placed on losing Bruce Brown, but it&rsquo;s been a gradual decline. At one point, they had arguably the best backup point guard (Monte Morris) and best backup center (a prime Mason Plumlee) in the league, but those days are long gone. Not only does that place too much of a burden on their starters in the playoffs, but it also places too much of a burden on them in the regular season as well. They are quite vulnerable to an injury to one of their stars. If Nikola Jokic ever missed extended time, they could turn into a disaster.</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>Right now, the Nuggets&rsquo; bench players are either too old (like DeAndre Jordan or Reggie Jackson) or too young. They need to be like Goldilocks and find the perfect balance between the two. Someone like their old friend Monte Morris (still only 28 years old) would be ideal as a floor general who can keep the offense running.</p>

<p>Given the Nuggets&rsquo; salary cap situation (a top-heavy roster), it&rsquo;ll be difficult to trade for meaningful players. Even re-signing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is going to stretch them to the breaking point.</p>

<p>It looks more and more like the Nuggets are going to need to <strong>rely on internal development.</strong> It&rsquo;s time for the kid to grow up. Zeke Nnaji will be entering Year 5. Peyton Watson will be entering Year 3. Christian Braun will be entering Year 3. Julian Strawther will only be in Year 2, but he was an older rookie. It&rsquo;s time to end the excuses. For context&rsquo;s sake, Nnaji and Braun are older than Anthony Edwards; we can&rsquo;t keep saying they&rsquo;re too young to contribute.</p>

<p>The Nuggets need to force-feed them all significant minutes next season to see what sticks. This year, they pushed hard to chase the # 1 seed, but we&rsquo;ve seen in the playoffs that homecourt advantage isn&rsquo;t as impactful as it used to be (as 5-seed Dallas closes in on three straight road-series wins). If the Nuggets carve out time for the kids to play &ndash; and carve out entire games where they start and play 30+ minutes here and there &ndash; they may be able to start to trust them more in the playoffs. If the Nuggets can enter the playoffs next year with a reliable 7-man rotation (or heck, even a 6-man rotation) they&rsquo;ll have a chance to win again.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(4 seed) Los Angeles Clippers: 51-31 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>The Clippers have a loaded roster, but it&rsquo;s an expensive and old one. Predictably, they ran out of gas. Predictably, Kawhi Leonard couldn&rsquo;t make it through the playoffs. And now, with free agency looming for James Harden and Paul George, we&rsquo;ll see how deep Steve Ballmer&rsquo;s pockets are. Is it worth paying through the nose for a first-round loser?</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>I presume Ballmer is pot committed &ndash; both to this roster, and to the idea of over-spending in order to vault the L.A. Clippers up into the &ldquo;prestige franchise&rdquo; territory. He doesn&rsquo;t want to blow it up and arrive in his brand-new arena with a rebuilding team.</p>

<p>And honestly, I don&rsquo;t think he needs to, either. The Clippers have some faint title hopes remaining &ndash; as long as Kawhi Leonard can suit up through an entire playoff run. For that to happen, the team may have to take <strong>load management to the next level</strong>. This season, Leonard played 68 games and averaged 34.3 minutes a night. That&rsquo;s not a ton, but it still may be too much. It&rsquo;s fair to ask: what if we reduced Leonard&rsquo;s workload in an extreme way? What if he only played 40 regular seasons (even when he&rsquo;s &ldquo;heathy&rdquo;) as he ramped up for the playoffs? What if he only started playing after the All-Star break (even if he&rsquo;s cleared)?</p>

<p>The Clippers may be uniquely suited to test that due to their depth and their stars. As much flak as James Harden gets, he&rsquo;s particularly good at making chicken salad out of chicken S and getting an average supporting cast to play above-average offensive basketball.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(6 seed) Phoenix Suns: 49-33 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>As local fan/hater Charles Barkley pointed out, the Suns are soft &ndash; physically and mentally. I suppose that&rsquo;s what happens when you overload your entire roster with shooting guards. When you have Devin Booker in tow, you probably don&rsquo;t need to double down with Diet Booker in Bradley Beal. Some of their next best players are shooting guards like Grayson Allen as well.</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>The Suns would love to add a <strong>bigger, physical wing</strong> to help balance out this roster. They made some earnest attempts to do that, but it didn&rsquo;t work out. Keita Bates-Diop had the frame, but he couldn&rsquo;t shoot reliably. They acquired Royce O&rsquo;Neale who fits the 3+D prototype, but he&rsquo;s only 6&rsquo;4&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Is there a way to fill that hole (without somehow wooing LeBron James)? I don&rsquo;t know. The team salary cap makes it difficult. They&rsquo;re committed to <span class="math inline">\(200M in salary, and \)</span>150M of that is tied up into their three stars. The team can try to find a taker for Bradley Beal &ndash; especially if it&rsquo;s a team that would give them a 2 for 1 &ndash; but that may be a pipe dream.</p>

<p>It also may be a pipe dream, but god willing, the team needs Coach Mike Budenholzer to convince Kevin Durant and company to <strong>shoot more threes</strong>. It&rsquo;s a simple tweak that would take Durant&rsquo;s already-great efficiency to the next level. The stat I always cite is: for his career, Durant shoots better than James Harden from 2%, 3%, <em>and</em> from FT%, but his true shooting is nearly identical to Harden&rsquo;s because of Harden&rsquo;s shot diet. The Suns still haven&rsquo;t gotten that memo, because they ranked 25th in three-point attempts despite a roster that&rsquo;s tailor made to launch them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(7 seed) New Orleans Pelicans: 49-33 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>After a playoff disappointment, there&rsquo;s a lot of talk about breaking up (or tweaking) the band here with a Brandon Ingram trade specifically. At this point, you can argue that the Pelicans have grown past the need to rely on Ingram or to pay him an enormous salary. After all, Zion Williamson played 70 games this year and looked pretty spry on both ends.</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just running out of gas with this post myself, because I&rsquo;m shrugging my shoulders here and saying keep plugging away with the current roster. In fact, I&rsquo;d even say to <strong>lean in to their &ldquo;medium-ball&rdquo; approach.</strong></p>

<p>As good as Ingram and Williamson are, what I like most about this Pelicans roster is their abundance of big wings. Herbert Jones, Trey Murphy III, even Naji Marshall (a free agent). We&rsquo;ve already talked about numerous teams that are looking for players in this mold, and the Pelicans have a boatload of them. They looked most effective to me when they played all their &ldquo;mediums&rdquo; at once &ndash; including Larry Nance Jr. as a smallball 5. It&rsquo;s the preferred style of the modern NBA and the Pelicans have the ability to embrace it. I don&rsquo;t see the point of messing with that formula by shedding Ingram, who also can blend in well with that type of lineup.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(8 seed) Los Angeles Lakers: 47-35 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>Both LeBron James and Anthony Davis played over 70 games this year &ndash; and both played exceptionally well. And yet, somehow, the Lakers still finished as the 8th seed and still lost 4-1 in the first round. Something ain&rsquo;t right here.</p>

<p>The Lakers made some tweaks to their rotation in midseason (like shelving Cam Reddish) that worked decently well, and will make a tweak to their coaching staff now (by shedding Darvin Ham). Still, any new coach &ndash; J.J. Redick or otherwise &ndash; isn&rsquo;t a miracle worker, so the stats suggest this roster needs stronger adjustments.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>The Lakers don&rsquo;t have to act like other teams. They&rsquo;re a prestige franchise planted in the heart of a glamor market in Los Angeles. They don&rsquo;t need to draft stars &ndash; or even trade for stars. They can use the <strong>dark arts</strong> to lure them in.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, LeBron James went to the Lakers because he wanted to go to the Lakers. Anthony Davis went to the Lakers because&hellip; uh, LeBron James wanted him to go to the Lakers. It&rsquo;s time for lightning to strike three times. As good as LeBron James and Anthony Davis are, they&rsquo;re not equipped to have an elite offense on their own. Both are average shooters by modern NBA standards. And it&rsquo;s difficult to have an elite offense without elite shooting these days. Adding a true bluechip shooter is essential.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Lakers, they have a lot of &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo; salaries to utilize in trade packages. Rui Hachimura makes <span class="math inline">\(17M, Austin Reaves makes \)</span>13M, Gabe Vincent makes <span class="math inline">\(11M, Jarred Vanderbilt makes \)</span>11M. If you can work out the proper compensation, you can land a $40M+ star to create a new &ldquo;Big Three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other teams aren&rsquo;t going to be lining up to help the Lakers and acquire their moderate assets, but the Lakers can force the issue behind the scenes. The ship has sailed on the Kyrie Irving boat, but it wouldn&rsquo;t shock me if the team can convince someone like Damian Lillard to demand a trade. Or someone like Paul George to take an uber/waymo across town. George is going to be a target for a lot of teams, but I think the Lakers have a better chance to pry him away than anyone else. He&rsquo;s already made $200M in his career so I doubt he&rsquo;s going to chase a payday or a slightly better chance at a ring somewhere else in the U.S. He&rsquo;s got a family and entertainment dreams, locked into L.A. But given that, a uniform change isn&rsquo;t asking too much.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s not George, it could even be Trae Young, Zach LaVine, whomever down the list you want to go. But more than any other team in this post, the Lakers need that major swing to get back into title contention.</p>

There would be so many good offers for him that even if OKC offered every pick they had, Utah would require them to give up a player like J Dub for him.  I’ve been hearing for 2 years from delusional Lakers fans that he is coming to LA.  The demand for him would be astronomical for a role player.</p>

If anyone can afford an expensive pricetag while maintaining depth on the roster, it&rsquo;s the Thunder. Not only do you guys have a ton of picks, but you&rsquo;ve done such a good job of drafting and developing those picks that you have a bevvy of impact players that Ainge may want. Giving up a couple of promising players is going to hurt in the short term, but if that means brining in someone like Lauri, I think it&rsquo;s worth the pain.</p>

      <label for="l6cew6y" class="commentText"><p>Well-thought out and well-reasoned.  As a Thunder fan, I&rsquo;ll focus on them.  I agree that, all things being equal, having a power forward who can rebound and is also comfortable on the perimeter would align with the Thunder&rsquo;s stylistic goals better than a non-shooter like Jarrett Allen.  The main problem is that those guys are rare.  Lauri Markkenen, Damantas Sabonis, Julius Randle, Jabari Smith Jr, Myles Turner, Michael Porter Jr, Paolo Banchero, Naz Reid are not for trade.  Lebron&rsquo;s not coming to OKC.  Maybe the Wizards give up on Deni Avidja if they draft a wing like Risacher, but I doubt it.  OKC&rsquo;s best case scenario is that Osmane Dieng breaks into the rotation and provides that big wing they need, while the Thunder find someone in free agency who can play minutes both with and without Holmgren.</p>

Everyone clamoring for a big man before and during the playoffs ignored what OP gets right here and that is the style of the team. We’ve already seen what it looks like when there’s a player on the floor who can’t shoot from outside. We need a big four who can swing out and play inside when needed. as I’ve said before, what we really need is wish.fom Al Horford, but I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Instead of going for a 250+ pound center, I&rsquo;d attempt to <strong>acquire a big forward</strong> instead. Someone who can help on the glass and provide some physicality to help Chet Holmgren, but someone who will also still be dynamic and a perimeter-oriented player on offense.</p>

<p>Who is this mythical big forward that is physical, has a dynamic perimeter skillset and also available? This description sounds like a player like Siakam, OG, Randle, LeBron, Lauri or Tatum who all aren&rsquo;t plausible targets.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ideal player is in the mold that you described, but I don&rsquo;t see how realistic it is to get one.</p>

<p>I saw Avdija mentioned in this thread. That&rsquo;s&hellip; interesting. He can defend, rebound, pass, handle some, drive some. I don&rsquo;t trust his shot, and I can&rsquo;t imagine how he&rsquo;d look on a good team. Might be worth the gamble depending on the Wizards&rsquo; price.</p>

<p>And look, it&rsquo;s the Thunder. They have all the picks. If they decide they want Lauri without giving up JDub, they can probably do it.</p>

Westbrook was a horrible fit, but also a 2-for-1 trade means a huge upgrade at the guard slot while losing only a single depth piece.</p>

<p>I agree OP&rsquo;s analysis was really facile though. DLO is also a great shooter. Reaves and Rui were solid. What the Lakers need is a downhill threat on offense, and more rebounding &amp; defense while still providing some spacing.</p>

      <label for="l6cbscp" class="commentText"><p>This is awesome! I love the style of this post, but the one time my team (the Mavericks) decides to go for a deep run, they aren&rsquo;t included.</p>

<p>Are you thinking of doing a write-up of symptoms/treatment of the other 4 teams in a separate post? I like the analysis and know there are a few symptoms they need to address this offseason that separates them from being a true contender. and not just a hot team going on a deep run.</p>

      <label for="l6cyno0" class="commentText"><p>I feel like there’s a correlation between isolation scoring, mid range shooting, and pull-up 3 point shooting with crunch time success. Neither Ant nor KAT do those things very well. Ant is bottom 5 in the league in iso (min 3 possessions per game) and worst in the nba in the midrange (min 3 FGA/game), and pull-up 3 point shooting (minimum 4 FGA/game). Meanwhile KAT doesn’t even have enough attempts to qualify. It’s just hard to generate offense consistently deep in the playoffs when you can’t do those things.</p>

<p>Although, another season opens up the chance for injuries to Gobert.</p>

      <label for="l6dyzju" class="commentText"><p>There needs to be improvement on it for sure.   Ant just is a developing playmaker.  He is good at kick outs to the corner.  Everything else about his playmaking is sub par.</p>

<p>The flow offense can be beautiful and it can be quite maddeningly stuck at times.   The team needs more motion and less standing around.</p>

I also extremely disagree with that. They just need a forward who can guard like two through four and also rebound really well like a Jarred Vanderbilt. They don&rsquo;t need another big center to put next to Holmgren</p>

      <label for="l6chvfu" class="commentText"><p>Great post! I think the Clippers are in a pretty interesting position. In retrospect, taking Dallas to 6 games without Kawhi for most of the series is quite impressive, and he clearly wasn’t at his best in the 2 games he did play. Especially if Dallas go on to the Finals, you would expect the Clippers to be confident in running it back next season.</p>

<p>Time is obviously against them though, so I do agree that they should take preventative measures and rest Kawhi for a lot of the regular season. The fact that he was able to play most of the season is reassuring, but given his history you just don’t want to take a chance like that from a competitive perspective. For a guy like Kawhi who seems to have a chronic injury, load management might just be part of treating his condition</p>

The problem is we have no offense off the bench so when Murray goes cold he&rsquo;s not carrying the bench minutes when we stagger him. I don&rsquo;t expect Braun or Watson&rsquo;s offensive game to get that much better so it really just depends on Strawther</p>
