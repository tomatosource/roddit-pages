      <label for="l8tw86f" class="commentText"><p>I always found it funny that the NBC crew at the time, who inevitably got many of the Bulls games, had both Isiah Thomas and Doug Collins.   </p>

<p>Both guys had unique relationships to Jordan. On top of that, Collins likely disliked Isiah as a player almost as much as Jordan did. Isiah played a big role in why Collins got fired as HC of the Bulls. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely give it to Isiah that you never heard any saltiness come out of his mouth when he was commentating on Bulls games. A far cry from a lot of modern day commentators, who wear their biases on their sleeves. You couldn&rsquo;t even tell that there was any bad blood between he and Jordan during these NBC telecasts. And Collins, for his part, always seemed very cool with Jordan. It never felt like he held any animosity for missing out on the Bulls dynasty. </p>

<p>If social media had been a thing in the mid 90s, maybe everyone would&rsquo;ve said the Bulls ruined the NBA and made it boring and that Rodman was a coward for taking the hardest road.</p>

<p>The discourse in society is a lot stupider now with media outlets peddling outrage bait <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for clicks and engagement.</p>

<p>This type of long, verbose monologue from Costas wouldn&rsquo;t even be allowed on a network anymore. They&rsquo;d give you a 10 second hot take followed by more commercials.</p>

      <label for="l8twzr7" class="commentText"><p>I think the truth is somewhere between him being as good as KD and him being a mere role player. He led the NBA in rebounding every year of the threepeat (&lsquo;96-&lsquo;98) and was 1st team All-Defense in 1996 as well. Having a guy who could help lock down the paint and generate extra possessions through the glass freed up the scorers to do their thing.</p>

<p>Rodman was on the top 75 All-Time team and was a core part of that Bulls squad. Not an MVP in his prime like KD, but still an all-time great who joined Chicago in free agency and helped them stave off the competition. I don&rsquo;t remember anyone back then calling him a punk or a ring chaser for choosing the best basketball situation even though he&rsquo;d been a rival to Chicago just a few seasons earlier.</p>

Only the Bulls have achieved that level of dominance for most of a decade since, in any sport, though the Spurs/Warriors/Patriots have showed that legit dynasties are possible in the 21st century.</p>

<p>So yeah it&rsquo;s very unlikely that we&rsquo;ll see anything quite like the 90&rsquo;s Bulls anytime soon. The Dodgers are trying something like that with Ohtani, Yamamoto and Betts but it remains to be seen if they actually win this year, much more rattle off 3 in a row with largely the same roster.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s quite comparable to the patriots (with a much larger gap in between). The 2001-4 pats and the 2014-18 teams both had large core groups of players that were constant across all 3 titles.</p>

      <label for="l8tvkm6" class="commentText"><p>Football is also just WAY harder to have a ring for ring equivalent dynasty in, it’s near, if not actually impossible because of the best of 1 playoff format. If the Bulls 1st game is the only one that mattered they lose 4 of their 6 titles in that dynasty. They don’t even make the finals in 2 of those 4 that we took away, losing in the 2nd round in one of them. The Patriots are the most absurd dynasty in modern sports, you’re just not supposed to have that level of sustained success in the NFL, it’s not supposed to be possible. Brady being more likely to be playing in the Super Bowl than not in a bo1 playoff format sport is actually fucking crazy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just that both the 2000s and 2010s dynasties were the patriots.</p>

<p>The difference in the nfl by the nature of the game and the much larger squads will always have a big turnover - even before free agency only 5 players were on all 4 of the 49ers 80s titles (70s steelers a ridiculous exemption with 22 players on all 4 titles).</p>
