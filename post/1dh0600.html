      <label for="l8u9r5s" class="commentText"><p>Apples to oranges comparison though. NBC’s coverage with Costas was all business, straight up reporting. That 2 minute monologue was outstanding whether Costas or a staffer wrote it.</p>

<p>TNT’s Inside the NBA is entertainment first, sports reporting a distant second. Save for Ernie and Kenny, I doubt those guys watch much games on nights they’re not on TV. With that kind of structure, hard to expect Ernie to offer up any monologue of that level. It’s not that kind of a show.</p>

      <label for="l8uoa28" class="commentText"><p>We should distinguish what Ernie is capable of vs. what he is allowed to do.</p>

<p>I find it funny that people make fun of ESPN when in fact they DID do this kind of monologue. Rachel Nichols would do it often on her segments. Here’s an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/_E9c_6Jlzac?si=22s76tZvM9R2Z4Jh" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/_E9c_6Jlzac?si=22s76tZvM9R2Z4Jh</a></p>

<p>I do think it’s less common nowadays but to some extent this kind of storytelling journalism is seen much more frequently now in podcast form.</p>

<p>On a related note, my favourite sports sign offs used to be the Olympics. I agree that coverage there has degraded to sewage levels in the US. You do get these kind of monologue retrospectives on broadcasters like the BBC and CBC (Canada) though. Here’s an example from the 2010 Olympics <a href="https://youtu.be/vX_dndXEGHI?si=yqE87nRpIU8gvqLv" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/vX_dndXEGHI?si=yqE87nRpIU8gvqLv</a></p>

<p>Even in those NBA Entertainment VHS tapes, it was always more a sense of awe when stars spoke about MJ—even when it was Isiah talking—though obviously those tapes were curated by the NBA.</p>

      <label for="l8tw86f" class="commentText"><p>I always found it funny that the NBC crew at the time, who inevitably got many of the Bulls games, had both Isiah Thomas and Doug Collins.   </p>

<p>Both guys had unique relationships to Jordan. On top of that, Collins likely disliked Isiah as a player almost as much as Jordan did. Isiah played a big role in why Collins got fired as HC of the Bulls. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely give it to Isiah that you never heard any saltiness come out of his mouth when he was commentating on Bulls games. A far cry from a lot of modern day commentators, who wear their biases on their sleeves. You couldn&rsquo;t even tell that there was any bad blood between he and Jordan during these NBC telecasts. And Collins, for his part, always seemed very cool with Jordan. It never felt like he held any animosity for missing out on the Bulls dynasty. </p>

<p>Zeke’s Pistons were 3-1 in the playoffs vs Jordan’s Bulls.</p>

<p>Prior to Jordan heading to the finals, the most watched NBA games in history were Lakers v Pistons, 76er’s v Pistons, Celtics v Pistons, and Bulls v Pistons.</p>

<p>And Costas point about teams being recognizable certainly applies to the Bad Boys.</p>

<p>If social media had been a thing in the mid 90s, maybe everyone would&rsquo;ve said the Bulls ruined the NBA and made it boring and that Rodman was a coward for taking the hardest road.</p>

<p>The discourse in society is a lot stupider now with media outlets peddling outrage bait <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for clicks and engagement.</p>

<p>This type of long, verbose monologue from Costas wouldn&rsquo;t even be allowed on a network anymore. They&rsquo;d give you a 10 second hot take followed by more commercials.</p>

<p>I mean the bulls pre and post Rodman were about the same, its completely different than gsw adding KD who was at worst the 3rd worst player in the league and tbh  at times even as good or better than lebron and curry</p>

<p>But I do agree with the overall premise of your statement.</p>

      <label for="l8twzr7" class="commentText"><p>I think the truth is somewhere between him being as good as KD and him being a mere role player. He led the NBA in rebounding every year of the threepeat (&lsquo;96-&lsquo;98) and was 1st team All-Defense in 1996 as well. Having a guy who could help lock down the paint and generate extra possessions through the glass freed up the scorers to do their thing.</p>

<p>Rodman was on the top 75 All-Time team and was a core part of that Bulls squad. Not an MVP in his prime like KD, but still an all-time great who joined Chicago in free agency and helped them stave off the competition. I don&rsquo;t remember anyone back then calling him a punk or a ring chaser for choosing the best basketball situation even though he&rsquo;d been a rival to Chicago just a few seasons earlier.</p>

You can not compare him to Durant at all. Did people not watch Rodman and the Pistons or with the Bulls? Are y’all just looking at stats?</p>

The 90s bulls aren’t even in the same stratosphere of todays era of superstars collaborating with each other to form superteams through free agency and trade demands.

      <label for="l8ufdgv" class="commentText"><p>agreed, i just meant more the dynastic winning.</p>

<p>no sport is going to ever command as much attention, given that prestige television streaming, videogame streaming, Tiktok/Instragram doomscrolling, etc.  Too much competition for eyeballs.</p>

<p>Granted, we are all fairly myopic. Everyone said LOST was the last event tv show, then Game of Thrones came along.</p>

<p>Nobody is going to top Pete Sampras&rsquo;s 14 titles for a long time; 3 players immediately did it.</p>

<p>The right team in the right sport could maybe reach those heights again. If they opened up the Colleseum and had gladiators fight to the death in World Cup with 1 contestant from every country and everyone dies except the last guy&hellip; I could see that attracting a lot of eyeballs.</p>

<p>Then imagine the MJ of Gladiatorial death combat goes back-to-back-to-back&hellip; with a billion dollar prize on the line&hellip; I feel like the whole world would be watching THAT.</p>

<p>So never say never!</p>

<p>2016 is the best season I’ve ever witnessed. Two of the most iconic plays in finals history with the block and Kyrie 3, 2 3-1 comebacks including 2 of the best playoff series of all time, 73-9, Lebron’s redemption, Kobe and Duncan’s farewell, and the last year of parity in the league.</p>

<p>2013 was another incredible year. Peak LeBron, Knicks being good, 7 game conference final including iconic PG poster,  Gutsy 2013 young warriors team that put up a fight in the 2nd round, and of course, one of the best finals of all time with an iconic ray Allen 3</p>

<p>2010 another great year. Peak parity, all 8 western conference playoff teams had 50 wins. Iconic 7 game finals between Lakers and Celtics. Celtics Cavs series that ended lebron’s first stint in Cleveland. Kobe-Nash conference finals. The youngest scoring champ in NBA history in Durant.</p>

And, of course, a huge part of the Lakers&rsquo; 2000s success was due to Shaq who they got from free agency (the same Shaq who ended up winning another championship after moving to a different team).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really 2010s where the narrative changes with its two best players, LeBron and KD, changing teams multiple times. The KD move was so big, even the Warriors were never looked at the same way.</p>

      <label for="l8u5k7l" class="commentText"><p>Consistently lost in these discussions is how few teams there were in the league in those decades. And how short the playoffs were. Some years it was just two rounds and then you were in the finals, and if you were the number one seed (out of <em>FOUR</em> in the entire conference), you had a bye and simply had to win <em>one round</em> to make it to the finals!</p>

<p><em>Six</em> of the eight teams in the NBA made it into the playoffs (three from each conference). It&rsquo;s just mathematically a completely different beast compared to the probability of making it to the playoffs, let alone winning a championship now. Not to mention the fatigue factor of a much longer playoff workload.</p>

<p>It really puts the Celtics 18 championships into context. The bulk of those (I believe eight or nine) were won during the end of the fifties and almost to the end of the sixties, when there were only between eight and ten teams in the entire league!</p>

<p>By 1968 there 12 teams. By 1969 there were 14. The expansion accelerated from there.</p>

<p>It really irks me that seemingly <em>nobody</em> ever brings this up when talking about these early dynasties.</p>

<p>So yeah it&rsquo;s very unlikely that we&rsquo;ll see anything quite like the 90&rsquo;s Bulls anytime soon. The Dodgers are trying something like that with Ohtani, Yamamoto and Betts but it remains to be seen if they actually win this year, much more rattle off 3 in a row with largely the same roster.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s quite comparable to the patriots (with a much larger gap in between). The 2001-4 pats and the 2014-18 teams both had large core groups of players that were constant across all 3 titles.</p>

      <label for="l8tvkm6" class="commentText"><p>Football is also just WAY harder to have a ring for ring equivalent dynasty in, it’s near, if not actually impossible because of the best of 1 playoff format. If the Bulls 1st game is the only one that mattered they lose 4 of their 6 titles in that dynasty. They don’t even make the finals in 2 of those 4 that we took away, losing in the 2nd round in one of them. The Patriots are the most absurd dynasty in modern sports, you’re just not supposed to have that level of sustained success in the NFL, it’s not supposed to be possible. Brady being more likely to be playing in the Super Bowl than not in a bo1 playoff format sport is actually fucking crazy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just that both the 2000s and 2010s dynasties were the patriots.</p>

<p>The difference in the nfl by the nature of the game and the much larger squads will always have a big turnover - even before free agency only 5 players were on all 4 of the 49ers 80s titles (70s steelers a ridiculous exemption with 22 players on all 4 titles).</p>
