      <p>Yao Ming&rsquo;s first game against Shaq. Seeing a 7&rsquo;6 center that&rsquo;s actually skilled going up against a slightly shorter but physically dominant player like Shaq was so cool to watch. O&rsquo;Neal won the statistical battle but Yao held his own and Houston won the game. He blocked Shaq&rsquo;s first 3 shots after all. He became my favorite player and inspired me to play basketball.</p>

      <label for="lj6cdwk" class="commentText"><p>Basically only knew Shaq, Kobe and MJ because I was playing some NBA Live 2002 game with a friend at his birthday, one day at noon I come home, there&rsquo;s an NBA finals game on TV (not live, I&rsquo;m french), I see Shaq and Kobe, I think I&rsquo;m gonna root for them, then I see the Pistons kicking their ass, and man I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, this might be a stupid reason to become a fan, but that Chauncey/Rip/Tay/Sheed/Big Ben team was sooooooo cool, especially Big Ben. I hate how people use that term soooo much now, but that team had so much aura.</p>

<p>Still a fan but let&rsquo;s say that 15 years Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva, Josh Smith, Rodney Stuckey, Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson have made it clear how lucky I was from 2004 to 2008</p>

      <label for="lj6d2f4" class="commentText"><p>Big Ben Wallace was a superstar on the defensive end. Another one of my favorite players. The afro adds to his coolness. Was at a height disadvantage yet was strong enough to guard power forwards and centers and quick enough to guard perimeter players in a pinch. He may not have slowed down Shaq in the &lsquo;04 Finals, but he made the guy work for every shot. Against any other big man, Shaq would have probably averaged close to 30+ points and 16 rebounds.</p>

I was in a big gambling phase back in 2021 and exclusively watched NFL at that point but wanted something to gamble on one night and the Warriors played that night and I knew they had a player named Steph Curry and he was supposed to be really good so I bet on them. Fast foward to the end of the game and he takes <a href="https://youtu.be/pSFOC-cYtwI?t=478" target="_blank">this shot</a> in crunch time and I go from &ldquo;What the fuck is he trolling&rdquo; to &ldquo;Oh my god what a legend&rdquo; in the span of a second and I&rsquo;ve been hooked on watching him ever since lol</p>

<p>OKC vs Dallas, Dec. 29 2011</p>

<p>1.4s remaining in the 4th, OKC inbounding for the final shot down by 1 at home. Sefolosha hits KD with the in bound pass, KD shoots a deep 3, nothing but net 👌</p>

<p>I had only really started following the NBA about a year prior and was already rooting for OKC cause I liked the new team, KD and Russ were a great young duo etc. but that moment is burned into my brain. The moment I realized &ldquo;oh, damn.. this dude is THAT GUY&rdquo;</p>

Say what you will of that finals but that was some of the most climactic, intense basketball I’ve ever seen to this day. The pace was so slow and the defence was so incredible on both sides that every basket felt so crucial. Game 7 of that same series solidified my NBA fandom.</p>

<p>Horry, Manu, Duncan, and the entire Pistons starting 5 will forever have a special place in my heart. I miss that brand of basketball and find myself only watching very specific playoff games these days. </p>

      <label for="lj6pftm" class="commentText"><p>I didn&rsquo;t get into basketball cuz of the NBA. I just did the kids basketball, soccer, and baseball leagues and found that I didn&rsquo;t care for soccer or baseball. I think I only did 1 year of the basketball league too compared to like 3 of the baseball and 6 or 7 of the soccer. Idk why I played so much damn soccer lol.</p>
