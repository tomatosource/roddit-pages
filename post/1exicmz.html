      <p>Yao Ming&rsquo;s first game against Shaq. Seeing a 7&rsquo;6 center that&rsquo;s actually skilled going up against a slightly shorter but physically dominant player like Shaq was so cool to watch. O&rsquo;Neal won the statistical battle but Yao held his own and Houston won the game. He blocked Shaq&rsquo;s first 3 shots after all. He became my favorite player and inspired me to play basketball.</p>

      <label for="lj6cdwk" class="commentText"><p>Basically only knew Shaq, Kobe and MJ because I was playing some NBA Live 2002 game with a friend at his birthday, one day at noon I come home, there&rsquo;s an NBA finals game on TV (not live, I&rsquo;m french), I see Shaq and Kobe, I think I&rsquo;m gonna root for them, then I see the Pistons kicking their ass, and man I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, this might be a stupid reason to become a fan, but that Chauncey/Rip/Tay/Sheed/Big Ben team was sooooooo cool, especially Big Ben. I hate how people use that term soooo much now, but that team had so much aura.</p>

<p>Still a fan but let&rsquo;s say that 15 years Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva, Josh Smith, Rodney Stuckey, Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson have made it clear how lucky I was from 2004 to 2008</p>

      <label for="lj6d2f4" class="commentText"><p>Big Ben Wallace was a superstar on the defensive end. Another one of my favorite players. The afro adds to his coolness. Was at a height disadvantage yet was strong enough to guard power forwards and centers and quick enough to guard perimeter players in a pinch. He may not have slowed down Shaq in the &lsquo;04 Finals, but he made the guy work for every shot. Against any other big man, Shaq would have probably averaged close to 30+ points and 16 rebounds.</p>

<p>OKC vs Dallas, Dec. 29 2011</p>

<p>1.4s remaining in the 4th, OKC inbounding for the final shot down by 1 at home. Sefolosha hits KD with the in bound pass, KD shoots a deep 3, nothing but net üëå</p>

<p>I had only really started following the NBA about a year prior and was already rooting for OKC cause I liked the new team, KD and Russ were a great young duo etc. but that moment is burned into my brain. The moment I realized &ldquo;oh, damn.. this dude is THAT GUY&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a bunch of games like that where I just had to shoot hoops afterward. Didn&rsquo;t matter if it was dark or not, just have to go out in the driveway and put up shots for 30-40 mins. Steph&rsquo;s OKC shot was a throwback to that feeling.</p>

I was in a big gambling phase back in 2021 and exclusively watched NFL at that point but wanted something to gamble on one night and the Warriors played that night and I knew they had a player named Steph Curry and he was supposed to be really good so I bet on them. Fast foward to the end of the game and he takes <a href="https://youtu.be/pSFOC-cYtwI?t=478" target="_blank">this shot</a> in crunch time and I go from &ldquo;What the fuck is he trolling&rdquo; to &ldquo;Oh my god what a legend&rdquo; in the span of a second and I&rsquo;ve been hooked on watching him ever since lol</p>

Say what you will of that finals but that was some of the most climactic, intense basketball I‚Äôve ever seen to this day. The pace was so slow and the defence was so incredible on both sides that every basket felt so crucial. Game 7 of that same series solidified my NBA fandom.</p>

<p>Horry, Manu, Duncan, and the entire Pistons starting 5 will forever have a special place in my heart. I miss that brand of basketball and find myself only watching very specific playoff games these days.¬†</p>

      <label for="lj6v0ca" class="commentText"><p>Basketball isn&rsquo;t big where I&rsquo;m from. I first tuned in during the 2008 Olympics, then 4 years passed and in came the 2012 Olympics. I remember watching Melo going absolutely nuts against Nigeria and Lebron&rsquo;s superhuman athleticism and IQ.</p>

<p>After the Olympics, I was sports betting with friends and decided to bet on the Miami Heat against the Suns, only knowing Bron was on Heat, and him being pretty much the best player in the world. I won, bet some more, and started casually watching Heat&rsquo;s games with Wade and Bron in their primes.</p>

<p>If I had to pick a specific game besides the Olympics, the  playoff finals that year made me a bonafide fan (and a certified LeBron dickrider). After Ray Allen hitting the clutch 3 in game 6, there was no going back. It was so exciting!</p>

For some reason every morning they always talked about one guy the most. Lebron. I thought, hmm, that guy seems pretty good. From them on I was hooked. Interestingly enough my brother became a Melo fan this way. This was 2005. I have a kid, a mortgage, and wife now. Crazy</p>

I just did the kids basketball, soccer, and baseball leagues and found that I didn&rsquo;t care for soccer or baseball. I think I only did 1 year of the basketball league too compared to like 3 of the baseball and 6 or 7 of the soccer. Idk why I played so much damn soccer lol.</p>

      <label for="lj73wll" class="commentText"><p>I was aware of basketball, and knew who Michael Jordan was and had seen him play before his first retirement, but it was his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08O6NC4o-Q8" target="_blank">comeback game</a> that made me a permanent fan. I would go on to watch every game I possibly could of Michael Jordan.</p>

<p>So I was already a fan of basketball, particularly of Michael Jordan, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1co1Y4JxIYk" target="_blank">this is the game</a> that leveled me up. For some reason I felt like camping out in the living room (which didn&rsquo;t normally have a tv, but I carried my brick tube television in and set up a cozy spot on the floor) and clicked over to WGN, which was available in Minnesota. I knew who Kevin Garnett was, of course, but wasn&rsquo;t really intrigued by him in any significant way until my Art teacher taped a photo of him up on the wall in which he was blocking a shot so damn high in the air that it looked cartoonishly fake. I&rsquo;ve tried finding that image online recently with no luck. Anyway, I knew the Wolves were going to lose, I was just watching because I liked Jordan and the Bulls, and was becoming increasingly interested in seeing Kevin Garnett play.</p>

<p>You have to understand that the Wolves&hellip; sucked. They were 21-61 in 1995. They would only improve slightly this particular season, going 26-56 &ndash; despite having some serious talent on the team. But that game against the mighty Bulls made basketball more than just watching MJ and his insanely good Bulls team destroy everything in their path. I saw a spark of competition from my home town Wolves and they would go on to barely lose that game. They almost stole one from what would be and remain the greatest team of all time until the Warriors clipped their record. And what I saw that season was no lie, as the Wolves improved significantly the sext season to 40-42, and the season after that they would become a perennial playoff team for the first time. They wouldn&rsquo;t miss the playoffs again until 2005 despite having a winning record. The west was just stacked. In 2006 everything fell apart, then KG left, and the rest is history. But holy shit, that game in 1996.</p>

I got into it when I seen kawhi in the 2019 finals, his midrange jumper is so beautiful. That made me a fan to this day and is why I watch nba hoops and old school hoops</p>
