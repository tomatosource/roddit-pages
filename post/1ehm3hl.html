<blockquote>
<p>The one thing the NBA pushed back on in the entirety of this process was a clip where Scottie, in the locker room (they were joking around saying what they were going to do when they won the title), and Scottie said “I’m gonna stick a cattle prod up Jerry Krause’s butt and give that guy a heart attack,” and everybody laughed.</p>

<p>I included that in our rough cuts because I wanted people to see what this guy [Krause] was going through day-in and day-out, and that&rsquo;s the one thing that they made me take out in 3 to 4 years of [making the documentary].</p>

      <label for="lg1ui59" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m so happy that people understand this was <em>his</em> decision now. I read The Jordan Rules so many years ago and the book is very clear in mentioning that Pippen took that deal against everyone&rsquo;s advice, even his own agent. Pippen was raised in extreme poverty so I understand why he took the guaranteed money, and I can&rsquo;t fault his not being able to predict the nba&rsquo;s rich future that only lies a couple short years ahead, but blaming everyone else for the next 7 years over his own decision was fucking stupid and so damaging, even for himself</p>

<p>“White players are more often willing to run patterns and to work collectively.”</p>

<p>“Because of the predominance of blacks in pro basketball, the sport is rapidly disintegrating into a one-on-one sport. There are only five or six NBA teams who play with more than a superficial degree of team unity.”</p>

<p>On the Knicks: “The starting front court played white basketball while guards played black basketball.”</p>

<p>“Black kids growing up want to be the superstar of their neighborhood. They want to be the toughest kids on the block, the richest or, once they get to the playground, the best one-on-one basketball players. White kids, on the other hand, usually are raised in a more homogeneous environment which provides other outlets for personal expression. They’re also constantly being taught the principle of subordinating their own personal glory for the good of the group.”</p>

<p>October 1999: “I don’t mean to say [that] as a snide remark toward a certain population in our society, but they have a limitation of their attention span, a lot of it probably due to too much rap music going in their ears and coming out their being.”</p>

      <label for="lg0h6em" class="commentText"><p>I’m certainly not an expert on the 90s Bulls (except for the part where they broke my heart by beating the Jazz in the finals twice in a row), but <em>The Last Dance</em> is 100% MJ’s own PR/propagandized version of the story. He wants to make himself look good, so he’s going to paint himself in the best light.</p>

<p>Jerry Krause was already dead, so he was an easy scapegoat and villain since he couldn’t fight back. I’m sure the dude was also kind of an asshole, but it seems to me like he was a convenient target to pin the dysfunction on.</p>

      <label for="lg1oyfy" class="commentText"><p>Jackson originally didn&rsquo;t want to come back before that. He thought that seven years was the most that a coach could stay before getting tuned out.</p>

<p>In 1995 — his sixth season as Bulls head coach — Jackson told Krause and Reinsdorf he would only return after his contract expired in 1996 if the team cut loose of every player from the first three-peat, including Pippen.</p>

<p>This would satisfy Jackson in two ways: he would have a new flock, as it were, thus resetting his seven-year theory; and he would have a chance to embrace the challenge of winning without Jordan, something that Krause later wanted to do as well.</p>

<p>This plan was upended when Jordan left baseball because of the strike and returned to the Bulls.</p>

<p>“I wanted to coach seven years,” Jackson told Telander. “Now it’s nine. … But this is our last year — we’re playing it out. For Michael, Scottie, Dennis, Steve, Luc, Jud Buechler, a couple others, this is it.”</p>

<p>Phil Jackson was exiting, too, but not because the Bulls pushed. Jackson admits Reinsdorf offered him a long-term deal to remain, but Jackson had this thing about the number of years players would listen to a coach and had set it at seven years with the Bulls. He now was through nine and promised himself he&rsquo;d leave no matter what. It was only appeals from players that brought him back in 1996. He was determined nothing would change his mind this time.</p>

<p>IIRC Krause used to always snipe at players and suggest other stars were better and try to lowball players in contract stuff. He also said the organisation (more specifically him) was more important to the success of the team than the players, which is naturally going to piss off the players that are actually grinding away winning the games.</p>

      <label for="lg0e7px" class="commentText"><p>Tbf tho, execs are supposed to try and sign guys for the best value they can.  You can’t run a competent FO giving out friendly deals,  and a big part of why the Bulls were so great is having guys on cheaper deals (and thus being able to build an unreal roster).</p>

<p>Pippens 7 year contract was low because signing a 24 year old guy till he’s 32 takes all the risk from the player and gives it to the team.  If he gets injured or declines it would have been a great deal for Pippen.</p>

<p>The risk for the Bulls paid off and Pippen decided he wanted a new deal.</p>

<p>It would be the equivalent of me selling you 90% of a lottery ticket and then wanting to renegotiate when it wins.  You lose out on the potential reward by hedging your bets.</p>

Krause made multiple trips to Europe trying to convince Kukoc to join the team in the middle of the Bull&rsquo;s first championship season. The team was already having a hard time coalescing; his relentless pursuit of Kukoc was gasoline to the fire. Kukoc aside, Krause was constantly swindling, trying to cut scabby deals to make any possible personnel upgrade. This meant guys were unsure of their role and future with the team&hellip; Krause found Pippen, most everything he did after that just fomented instability.</p>

      <label for="lg2mebs" class="commentText"><p>The Krause revisionism reflex after the Last Dance is crazy. Maybe he got a bit too much criticism but it’s not like Krause was heavily scrutinized by the media even as the Bulls run was coming to an end. And when all the Bulls fans booed him, it wasn’t because they are just MJ lackeys. To be clear, Phil also hated Krause</p>

<p>The fact that Mj and Pippen were assholes doesn’t take away from the fact that Krause was an arrogant prick who let his ego get in the way of success by the end. Even if Krause made some good decisions, he was a detrimental factor by the end. Just how well did the Bulls do after he ran MJ, Pippen, and Phil out?</p>

      <label for="lg3qbvi" class="commentText"><p>if 1 guy or even a handful of guys hate a person it’s probably pettiness .</p>

<p>Jerry Krause clearly was the cause of general dislike from players, co-workers , colleagues and the media .</p>

<p>Krause i think clearly had some things about him that turned people against him to the point speaking ill of him wasn’t just common but accepted as regular discourse .</p>

<p>it looks bad now because he’s dead and can’t defend himself but no one was defending him when he was alive either.</p>

      <label for="lg1pjsm" class="commentText"><p>Never know why this doesn’t get brought up. Jordan walked into kraus office and wanted kraus to draft wolf and kraus told Mike he’s out of his mind and doesn’t know what he’s talking about and is taking pippen end discussion. And Mike got so pissed off. But kraus always took the rewards himself and talked a lot about how important he was but he was also a huge talent acquisition and getter in the 90s before the final split</p>

      <label for="lg4tg6a" class="commentText"><p>It never gets brought up which is a shame because that’s really the crux of the issue: MJ and Kraus didn’t get along because Kraus wouldn’t bend the knee. And nobody will take a GMs side over the star player even when hindsight has proven that player is literally one of the worst talent evaluators in NBA history.</p>

<p>The Championships don’t happen without Jordan for sure. But I don’t think they happen without Kraus either because no other GM would have stood up to him and the 90s bulls would look like the 2010s Bobcats</p>
