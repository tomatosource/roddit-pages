</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I find it fascinating how a playoff series that comes down to a few plays here and there can affect the narratives around players&rsquo; historical standing so greatly.</p>

<p>Which single series do you think could have changed how a player is/will be remembered if the series outcome was reversed?</p>

<p>Some contenders:</p>

<p>Kobe, 2008 Finals: could have matched Jordan on 6 rings &amp; 2x threepeats, would only trail MJ and LeBron in Finals MVPs, exclusive club of MVP &amp; FMVP in same year</p>

<p>LeBron, 2011 Finals: no chokejob/stain on record, threepeat in Miami to serve as a peak that rivals Jordan along with superior longevity, stronger GOAT claim</p>

<p>Moses Malone, 1981 Finals: historic achievement of only championship team with a losing record in the regular season, exclusive club of FMVP run with no All-Star teammates, elite club of FMVP with two teams, would be almost impossible to exclude from top 10 conversations.</p>

<p>Garnett, 2004 WCF: matched up vs. the 04 Pistons arguably better than the Lakers (more egalitarian, perimeter-focused offense to avoid Ben Wallace; 2-0 vs. Pistons in regular season). A championship would mean Garnett came in as a HS kid and led a small market expansion team that had never made the playoffs before him to the mountaintop. Arguably best ring ever.</p>

      <label for="llkdzc9" class="commentText"><p>Similarly, I think LeBron is the significant majority GOAT if he wins the finals in 2011.  He would have a 3 peat, possibly the heaviest ring ever in 2016, and the 2020 ring.  Obviously there would still be 6&amp;gt;5 type people, but literally the number 1 argument you hear against LeBron is the 2011 finals.</p>

<p>Obviously this doesn’t really “reverse the narrative” on Bron as a whole but it’s a very important championship</p>

<p>Edit: Conference finals not finals</p>

      <label for="llk2jkv" class="commentText"><p>This is definitely a good answer. Bud would’ve been fired, the Bucks probably hire someone worse, Giannis is likely still seen as a playoff choker because although he had a great game 7 in his own right against Brooklyn win or lose, all of the most legendary parts of that run for him took place afterward. </p>

<p>Khris might also be seen quite differently, as he really didn’t start lighting it up and having his clutch moments until game 3 against Atlanta. Heck, he might even no longer be a Buck. </p>

      <label for="llko66f" class="commentText"><p>He was great in the Brooklyn series. He averaged 32/13/4, I’d say if we lost that series it was on Bud and Jrue.</p>

<p>Bud refused to have everyone attack one legged harden and to make any adjustments at all and Jrue was just ass offensively the whole series</p>

<p>Khris fault as well but not as much, he had some good games that series iirc but he was also inconsistent.</p>

<p>If it had been that off-season, I bet they would have pursued Carlisle or Stotts pretty hard. Not saying they are better, but there were good coaches on the market at that time</p>

<p>To be that&rsquo;s more interesting than LeBron/Kobe/LD winning another</p>

<p>It’s like saying if the Nets beat the Heat in 2014 after the trade and won the title. Yes it would change legacies but it was not happening.</p>

<p>Also the Magic were an excellently constructed team in 2009, PEDs and all</p>

My point is that if you discuss those then you can come up with all types of bullshit proposals that are not really worth considering. Even if through some type of incredible lucky the Nuggets won, they would&rsquo;ve been significantly disfavored against the Magic.</p>

<p>Some wild bullshit examples are like: &ldquo;what if Blake Griffin led the Pistons to a ring in 2019&rdquo; based on criteria like that. They just aren&rsquo;t within the realm of possibility and not interesting to consider.</p>

      <label for="llkkfs5" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll go slightly deeper in this one: Simmons was defending Kawhi and then Embiid slid in to take over. If it&rsquo;s Simmons the whole time, I wonder if he could have gotten a cleaner contest on the shot. If Simmons gets a game defining block to go into overtime and potentially send the Sixers to the ECF, i think that changes a lot of the perception around him.</p>

<p>When CP3 was on, he sometimes looked as close to Jordan to be honest in the 4th, hitting midrange shot after shot at an insanely high clip, especially with the Suns in his first run there. Definitely deserved to win if not for injuries, which ironically, is also part of his legacy&hellip;.</p>

      <label for="llkazvi" class="commentText"><p>In a different take, Lebron&rsquo;s first trip to the Finals against the Spurs. I think if he wins that, he&rsquo;s definitely the GOAT over MJ, because he legit led an underdog team to the chip.</p>

<p>Reggie in 2000, finally got his chip after years of Jordan.</p>

<p>Same for AI the following year in 2001.</p>

<p>If you wanna pick a series to make Lebron the GOAT, then it&rsquo;s definitely the 2018 finals. Would be the unquestionably greatest run of all time</p>

      <label for="llkio62" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not about the greatest series by either player, but what changes if they had actually won it. So to that end, 2018 is not relevant to any in the GOAT debate against MJ. His early career playoff failures is arguably the biggest weakness in MJs resume, and that he couldn&rsquo;t win a chip until other future stars got on the Bulls. Same thing happened with LeBron in his first stint in Cleveland. </p>

<p>So if LeBron won against the dynastic Spurs, then he would have done something that MJ couldn&rsquo;t, akin to MJ knocking off the Celtics led by Bird in the 80s which obviously didn&rsquo;t happen either.</p>

<p>People that still hold Lebron&rsquo;s early career losses against him (mostly 2011) for whatever reason have a hard time figuring out players can in fact get better over time. The biggest &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; in his resume is 4 vs 6 rings because that&rsquo;s about all the analytical capacity casual fans have</p>

      <label for="llk4h3u" class="commentText"><p>97 and 98 Finals. Huge effect on MJ&rsquo;s legacy, and even bigger effect on Stockton and Malone&rsquo;s legacies if things went the other way. Probably a wild impact on the sport itself, as the popularity of the Bulls and Jordan carried the league to it&rsquo;s high level of success and global reach in the 90s. No doubt that the Jazz winning would have hurt the sport&rsquo;s popularity. Who knows if we&rsquo;d even have seen the amount of international players we have now if Jordan didn&rsquo;t dominate that decade.</p>

<p>Lebron would probably be the undisputed GOAT. Stockton and Malone would be champs. It&rsquo;d be harder to deny that Malone is an all time great. His horrific off-court life combined with the zero rings make it easy to pretend he isn&rsquo;t one of the best to ever play the sport. It&rsquo;d be a lot harder if he took 2 rings from Jordan.</p>

Who the hell knows what that team would look like if they had gone to the ECF, maybe the finals, or even more maybe win it all? They ended up giving the raptors the closest series so they might have done it, or the warriors might have another ring. I think there are a lot of questions that are really hard to answer just from the kawhi buzzer going the other way.</p>

      <label for="lll0se0" class="commentText"><p>I know it was over a decade ago, but have we all forgotten how massive the 2012 Finals were? It&rsquo;s hard to imagine OKC blowing up that core or Durant ever leaving for GSW if we manage to win that series. On the other side, if Lebron&rsquo;s Heat lose their first two trips to the Finals, first against a less talented Dallas team and then to a much younger Thunder team, that means we&rsquo;re relying on Chris Bosh still getting that rebound and Ray Allen still hitting that corner 3 for Lebron to have <em>any</em> championships in Miami. There&rsquo;s like 4 MVPs and 7 or 8 HoFers whose legacies could be looked at differently if that series went the other way&hellip;like I wish it did 😭😂</p>

Jordan retired in 93 and the bulls won 3 less games by replacing him with toni kukoc. Pippen would have went on to win a ring without him. It will totally negate MJ&rsquo;s next 3 rings. Pippen would have been top 10 all time. Phil Jackson undisputed greatest coach of all time.</p>
