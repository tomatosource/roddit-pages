</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I find it fascinating how a playoff series that comes down to a few plays here and there can affect the narratives around players&rsquo; historical standing so greatly.</p>

<p>Which single series do you think could have changed how a player is/will be remembered if the series outcome was reversed?</p>

<p>Some contenders:</p>

<p>Kobe, 2008 Finals: could have matched Jordan on 6 rings &amp; 2x threepeats, would only trail MJ and LeBron in Finals MVPs, exclusive club of MVP &amp; FMVP in same year</p>

<p>LeBron, 2011 Finals: no chokejob/stain on record, threepeat in Miami to serve as a peak that rivals Jordan along with superior longevity, stronger GOAT claim</p>

<p>Moses Malone, 1981 Finals: historic achievement of only championship team with a losing record in the regular season, exclusive club of FMVP run with no All-Star teammates, elite club of FMVP with two teams, would be almost impossible to exclude from top 10 conversations.</p>

<p>Garnett, 2004 WCF: matched up vs. the 04 Pistons arguably better than the Lakers (more egalitarian, perimeter-focused offense to avoid Ben Wallace; 2-0 vs. Pistons in regular season). A championship would mean Garnett came in as a HS kid and led a small market expansion team that had never made the playoffs before him to the mountaintop. Arguably best ring ever.</p>

Jordan&rsquo;s first 3 rings would be worth less and he likely wouldn&rsquo;t have returned to the bulls had they won a ring without him which means no 2nd three peat.</p>

      <label for="lln1pac" class="commentText"><p>Just like the Bulls <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> lost to the Knicks and then Knicks were a tossup vs the Pacers, Bulls v Pacers wouldve pretty much been a tossup as well. And then perhaps another tossup, at best, (Rockets were definitely the better team between the two) in the finals. Bulls were 3 whole series short…it’s different if, say, they lost to the champs…then you could make a claim they probably would’ve won. But they lost to the guys that lost to the guys that won.</p>

      <label for="llnjkce" class="commentText"><p>For one, mostly everyone knows the regular season doesn’t mean much. If you’re sick, or your playoff seed it secure, you easily miss that game and relax…almost everyone bears through during the playoffs. I don’t think Jordan plays a flu game on the fifth game of the regular season. But definitely does on the 5th game of the finals.  While I agree with some of your statement, you’re talking about game 5 with the bad call (it was very bad). If you’re giving me a “if KD’s foot was a couple inches shorter” or maybe even “if Kawhi doesn’t hit that bucket”, it’s way easier to argue the outcome since KD hit the shot with 1 second left in game 7 and Kawhi prevented OT with perhaps the best buzzer beater of all time in game 7. A series isn’t even guaranteed if you go up 3-1 and definitely not 3-2…ask the Warriors (and OKC from that year…as well as many others).</p>

      <label for="llmiujg" class="commentText"><p>Obviously biased but I disagree with that. Solely based on defense. Those spurs teams were a juggernaut on defense throughout that whole decade and that’s what made them great. Dirk couldn’t do what TD did in that system. That being said, Dirk was a bit more talented offensively and if he had played in SA during the 2000s, no doubt they would have won at least 1 championship and likely more. But I don’t think Dirk wins 5 like TD</p>

      <label for="llmnipl" class="commentText"><p>Hard disagree, Tim Duncan in particular was a perfect superstar for the team they’d end up creating. Pop’s offense and offensive game plan wasn’t really up to snuff relative to how dominant and consistent they are historically. Not to say that they were anything approaching bad on offense, but for how strong the dynasty was their offense was pretty pedestrian. I don’t at all see that changing with dirk around because I don’t think pop would change much with dirk on the lineup. Ball movement would still definitely be king, probably more scoring overall but the defense would take too big of a dip imo.</p>

      <label for="llkdzc9" class="commentText"><p>Similarly, I think LeBron is the significant majority GOAT if he wins the finals in 2011.  He would have a 3 peat, possibly the heaviest ring ever in 2016, and the 2020 ring.  Obviously there would still be 6&amp;gt;5 type people, but literally the number 1 argument you hear against LeBron is the 2011 finals.</p>

<p>Obviously this doesn’t really “reverse the narrative” on Bron as a whole but it’s a very important championship</p>

      <label for="llkfe8g" class="commentText"><p>Carmelo never went to an NBA Finals, specially with that loaded Knicks team in &lsquo;13. How is one guy who has never had an All-Star teammate post-Nash departure, yet carried two different teams of either young guys and has-beens to the Finals, compared to a guy who was given all the help he needed in every franchise he&rsquo;s been, yet never even sniffed a Conference Finals?</p>

      <label for="llkk5ky" class="commentText"><p>In Dirk second run, he did have a DPOY on his team, and Melo did make a Confence Finals in 2009, I believe. That 2013 Knicks was also only ok. Amare was declining fast, and the rest of the players were older.</p>

<p>Edit: Conference finals not finals</p>

<p>Edit: Tysond Chanlder won his DPOY as a Knick.</p>

Same as all the trash being thrown Lively&rsquo;s way this offseason for calling out Rudy Gobert in Theo Pinson&rsquo;s podcast.

<p>Tyson Chandler was a DPOY level player who just didn’t get the recognition until the next season after boosting his profile but his play didn’t suddenly change.</p>

      <label for="llman8d" class="commentText"><p>Well, yes and no. The reason Chandler actually ended up in Dallas the first time around was he was acquired for cheap while also getting younger by moving away from Erick Dampier as the team&rsquo;s starting center. That&rsquo;s why he was only there for the championship season because he only had a year left on his contract that he signed in Chicago and he was being evaluated that year if he can really be the Mavs new lead defensive anchor, because he was coming off an injury laden season from Charlotte, as well as being denied to be traded to the Thunder by the Thunder themselves due to his injury history from New Orleans which is why he ended up in Charlotte.</p>

<p>Our franchise owner, being the guy who always thought he&rsquo;s the smartest guy in the room and will not let anyone in the room tell him otherwise, did not even thought about extending him during the season because he saw the oncoming CBA expiration at that time as a cheap move to hopefully extend Chandler on a cheaper contract after CBA negotiations. That&rsquo;s how much low and in doubt Chandler&rsquo;s value at the time when he got to Dallas.</p>

Bud would’ve been fired, the Bucks probably hire someone worse, Giannis is likely still seen as a playoff choker because although he had a great game 7 in his own right against Brooklyn win or lose, all of the most legendary parts of that run for him took place afterward. </p>

<p>Khris might also be seen quite differently, as he really didn’t start lighting it up and having his clutch moments until game 3 against Atlanta. Heck, he might even no longer be a Buck. </p>

<p>Bud refused to have everyone attack one legged harden and to make any adjustments at all and Jrue was just ass offensively the whole series</p>

He certainly carried the offense, but they had Mutumbo &amp; a lot of defense first guys. The team still had a +1.5 net rating when he was off the court.

<p>From 03-07 the Wolves were -10 with KG of the court, &amp; it only improves to -8.5 for his whole career there (-14 in the playoffs).</p>

      <label for="llkkfs5" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll go slightly deeper in this one: Simmons was defending Kawhi and then Embiid slid in to take over. If it&rsquo;s Simmons the whole time, I wonder if he could have gotten a cleaner contest on the shot. If Simmons gets a game defining block to go into overtime and potentially send the Sixers to the ECF, i think that changes a lot of the perception around him.</p>

      <label for="llkio62" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not about the greatest series by either player, but what changes if they had actually won it. So to that end, 2018 is not relevant to any in the GOAT debate against MJ. His early career playoff failures is arguably the biggest weakness in MJs resume, and that he couldn&rsquo;t win a chip until other future stars got on the Bulls. Same thing happened with LeBron in his first stint in Cleveland. </p>

<p>So if LeBron won against the dynastic Spurs, then he would have done something that MJ couldn&rsquo;t, akin to MJ knocking off the Celtics led by Bird in the 80s which obviously didn&rsquo;t happen either.</p>

      <label for="llk4h3u" class="commentText"><p>97 and 98 Finals. Huge effect on MJ&rsquo;s legacy, and even bigger effect on Stockton and Malone&rsquo;s legacies if things went the other way. Probably a wild impact on the sport itself, as the popularity of the Bulls and Jordan carried the league to it&rsquo;s high level of success and global reach in the 90s. No doubt that the Jazz winning would have hurt the sport&rsquo;s popularity. Who knows if we&rsquo;d even have seen the amount of international players we have now if Jordan didn&rsquo;t dominate that decade.</p>

<p>Lebron would probably be the undisputed GOAT. Stockton and Malone would be champs. It&rsquo;d be harder to deny that Malone is an all time great. His horrific off-court life combined with the zero rings make it easy to pretend he isn&rsquo;t one of the best to ever play the sport. It&rsquo;d be a lot harder if he took 2 rings from Jordan.</p>

Shaq/Kobe would have 3 and 4 rings respectively, if everything else stayed the same, Shaq would have 2FMVP only, they wouldn’t threepeat (it’s a big legacy thing since no team since then has ever done it and in modern times only Bulls have done it) - I’d think they might fall into the top 10-15 range rather than the usual 5-10 ish range they are in today.</p>

<p>He became widely hated after his announcement to Miami and failed his first year even tho he promised several rings with the top players in the league at the time. The following year, the same team of KG, Allen, Pierce and Rondo looked like they had him beat again. If he lost that game 6 he would’ve been clowned on and laughed at forever. Who knows how he would’ve dealt with such failures and if he’d redeem himself again</p>

Imagine that team losing in ECF after losing the finals as favorites the year prior. It would’ve stained that grouping forever and labeled LBJ as a loser that couldn’t even beat Boston with Wade and Bosh.
Maybe the team would’ve been altered significantly after that.</p>

It&rsquo;s hard to imagine OKC blowing up that core or Durant ever leaving for GSW if we manage to win that series. On the other side, if Lebron&rsquo;s Heat lose their first two trips to the Finals, first against a less talented Dallas team and then to a much younger Thunder team, that means we&rsquo;re relying on Chris Bosh still getting that rebound and Ray Allen still hitting that corner 3 for Lebron to have <em>any</em> championships in Miami. There&rsquo;s like 4 MVPs and 7 or 8 HoFers whose legacies could be looked at differently if that series went the other way&hellip;like I wish it did 😭😂</p>

      <label for="llkmgys" class="commentText"><p>If lebron wouldnt win with the cavs vs the warriors he would forever claim to be the best small forward of all time rathar than the greatest basketball player of all time (neither of the claims are true anyway imo).</p>

<p>Secondly - a year prior, if the cavs would win, lebron might have had a stronger claim for being the goat, coach Blatt wouldnt have been fired and he would start an area of succesful european coaches in the nba, an area that could change the nba and the basketball world all together.</p>

<p>This is a secret well kept only known for some of us basketball lovers ;)</p>

<p>After that, i really believe its a tie between 1998 Jordan, and 2016 lebron.  Both series cemented their respective stars legacies. Both are outstanding individual efforts. The kicker for me is that if either player loses that series and the other wins, the GOAT debate is forever shifted</p>

      <label for="lln5img" class="commentText"><p>The Pacers have peaked at the worst possible times compared to any other franchise I can think of.  Some of their best teams ever:</p>

<p>&lsquo;98 - Barely got beat by Jordan in his final year with the Bulls</p>

<p>&lsquo;00 - Ran into the prime Kobe/Shaq Lakers when Shaq was arguably at his peak and the personalities hadn&rsquo;t gotten out of control yet</p>

<p>&lsquo;04 - The Ben Wallace/Rip/Chauncey Pistons were just a hair better than the Pacers this year</p>

<p>&lsquo;05 - Malice at the Palace.  No bad opponent luck here, but the Pacers were probably the best team in the league that year and got absolutely neutered by the suspensions</p>

<p>&lsquo;14 - Ran into the Heatles at the peak of their run</p>

<p>Shift each of those windows by a year or two and Indy could absolutely have a ring.  Ultimately though, the teams weren&rsquo;t quite good enough.  horseshoes and hand grenades.</p>

It was a dent a few years back, but looking at this still ongoing resume now, it´s more like an imperfection that makes the whole picture complete. Also was later said to be mostly a team issue, which makes sense.</p>

It would have eliminated the choker motif that was played around that time as he would have carried a team to a championship at 22 years old.
The win then makes the next few years hurt less with the Recession and the decision. Z gets his ring.</p>

A repeat in dominating fashion which may have triggered some butterfly effect to voters seeing him as the next mj  resulting in him winning  mvp in 06 plus FMVP. Doesn&rsquo;t injure his shoulder in 07 and finishes career top 10-15 rather than regarded as top 20-30. Dont think Big 3 era helped Wade&rsquo;s solo case all that much outside of being the one who threw the pin point lobs to Bron. A lot of youngins see him as some 2nd option that wasn&rsquo;t capable of winning as the main guy when he did.</p>

Who the hell knows what that team would look like if they had gone to the ECF, maybe the finals, or even more maybe win it all? They ended up giving the raptors the closest series so they might have done it, or the warriors might have another ring. I think there are a lot of questions that are really hard to answer just from the kawhi buzzer going the other way.</p>

<p>Hell, even DeRozan&rsquo;s legacy will be affected and he didnt play in that series. Without that 2019 run, it wouldnt be clear who won the Kawhi-DeRozan trade.</p>

<p>Does Miami blow up after only two years? Does the mental hurdle get to LeBron and derail his career path? Does Ray go to Miami in the offseason?</p>

<p>Do the Celtics go on and win that Finals w Rondo as MVP? 3 Finals trips in 5 years with 2 rings for KG, Pierce and Ray</p>

<p>Does Danny do the Nets deal that lands Tatum and Brown?</p>

<p>Game 6 was really the defining moment in LeBron’s career. He was obviously a great player beforehand but the way he came out and got whatever he wanted, knew what the game needed possession to possession and was there to make crucial back breaking plays down the stretch to step on their throats was the moment everyone was waiting for.</p>

<p>He was in complete control of the game at every moment. It truly was something else to watch. The league and especially the Eastern Conference was on notice from then on</p>
