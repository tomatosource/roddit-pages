</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I find it fascinating how a playoff series that comes down to a few plays here and there can affect the narratives around players&rsquo; historical standing so greatly.</p>

<p>Which single series do you think could have changed how a player is/will be remembered if the series outcome was reversed?</p>

<p>Some contenders:</p>

<p>Kobe, 2008 Finals: could have matched Jordan on 6 rings &amp; 2x threepeats, would only trail MJ and LeBron in Finals MVPs, exclusive club of MVP &amp; FMVP in same year</p>

<p>LeBron, 2011 Finals: no chokejob/stain on record, threepeat in Miami to serve as a peak that rivals Jordan along with superior longevity, stronger GOAT claim</p>

<p>Moses Malone, 1981 Finals: historic achievement of only championship team with a losing record in the regular season, exclusive club of FMVP run with no All-Star teammates, elite club of FMVP with two teams, would be almost impossible to exclude from top 10 conversations.</p>

<p>Garnett, 2004 WCF: matched up vs. the 04 Pistons arguably better than the Lakers (more egalitarian, perimeter-focused offense to avoid Ben Wallace; 2-0 vs. Pistons in regular season). A championship would mean Garnett came in as a HS kid and led a small market expansion team that had never made the playoffs before him to the mountaintop. Arguably best ring ever.</p>

      <label for="llkdzc9" class="commentText"><p>Similarly, I think LeBron is the significant majority GOAT if he wins the finals in 2011.  He would have a 3 peat, possibly the heaviest ring ever in 2016, and the 2020 ring.  Obviously there would still be 6&amp;gt;5 type people, but literally the number 1 argument you hear against LeBron is the 2011 finals.</p>

<p>Obviously this doesn’t really “reverse the narrative” on Bron as a whole but it’s a very important championship</p>

      <label for="llk2jkv" class="commentText"><p>This is definitely a good answer. Bud would’ve been fired, the Bucks probably hire someone worse, Giannis is likely still seen as a playoff choker because although he had a great game 7 in his own right against Brooklyn win or lose, all of the most legendary parts of that run for him took place afterward. </p>

<p>Khris might also be seen quite differently, as he really didn’t start lighting it up and having his clutch moments until game 3 against Atlanta. Heck, he might even no longer be a Buck. </p>

<p>If it had been that off-season, I bet they would have pursued Carlisle or Stotts pretty hard. Not saying they are better, but there were good coaches on the market at that time</p>

<p>See I would actually pick the 06 series v the Suns, Up 3-1 on the 2nd seed with the MVP(not yet named, but Nash was the favourite)</p>

<p>If the Lakers secure one whole rebound, they win that series and Phil/Kobe get their playoff masterclass with one of the worst rosters surrounding an MVP all time.</p>

<p>2008 too many things have to change for things to go right. But for the 2006 series? Legit just one rebound needed to go their way.</p>

<p>When CP3 was on, he sometimes looked as close to Jordan to be honest in the 4th, hitting midrange shot after shot at an insanely high clip, especially with the Suns in his first run there. Definitely deserved to win if not for injuries, which ironically, is also part of his legacy&hellip;.</p>

      <label for="llk4h3u" class="commentText"><p>97 and 98 Finals. Huge effect on MJ&rsquo;s legacy, and even bigger effect on Stockton and Malone&rsquo;s legacies if things went the other way. Probably a wild impact on the sport itself, as the popularity of the Bulls and Jordan carried the league to it&rsquo;s high level of success and global reach in the 90s. No doubt that the Jazz winning would have hurt the sport&rsquo;s popularity. Who knows if we&rsquo;d even have seen the amount of international players we have now if Jordan didn&rsquo;t dominate that decade.</p>

<p>Lebron would probably be the undisputed GOAT. Stockton and Malone would be champs. It&rsquo;d be harder to deny that Malone is an all time great. His horrific off-court life combined with the zero rings make it easy to pretend he isn&rsquo;t one of the best to ever play the sport. It&rsquo;d be a lot harder if he took 2 rings from Jordan.</p>

A repeat in dominating fashion which may have triggered some butterfly effect to voters seeing him as the next mj  resulting in him winning  mvp in 06 plus FMVP. Doesn&rsquo;t injure his shoulder in 07 and finishes career top 10-15 rather than regarded as top 20-30. Dont think Big 3 era helped Wade&rsquo;s solo case all that much outside of being the one who threw the pin point lobs to Bron. A lot of youngins see him as some 2nd option that wasn&rsquo;t capable of winning as the main guy when he did.</p>

      <label for="llkio62" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not about the greatest series by either player, but what changes if they had actually won it. So to that end, 2018 is not relevant to any in the GOAT debate against MJ. His early career playoff failures is arguably the biggest weakness in MJs resume, and that he couldn&rsquo;t win a chip until other future stars got on the Bulls. Same thing happened with LeBron in his first stint in Cleveland. </p>

<p>So if LeBron won against the dynastic Spurs, then he would have done something that MJ couldn&rsquo;t, akin to MJ knocking off the Celtics led by Bird in the 80s which obviously didn&rsquo;t happen either.</p>

If it&rsquo;s Simmons the whole time, I wonder if he could have gotten a cleaner contest on the shot. If Simmons gets a game defining block to go into overtime and potentially send the Sixers to the ECF, i think that changes a lot of the perception around him.</p>
