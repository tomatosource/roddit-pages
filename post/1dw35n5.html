      <p>A lot of players that get lumped in that tag I’ve noticed have failed. Thon Maker, Dragen Bender, Poku, etc.</p>

<p>Has any prospect with the ‘Giannis’ tag succeeded in developing into a great player since he’s been drafted? <em>(obviously not as great as Giannis, but become a really solid player. Very good-All Star Caliber)</em></p>

He&rsquo;s been a finesse athlete who used to rely on his motor but then way improved his footwork and shot to get to his now quite excellent midrange game.</p>

<p>I hate when people say this about Giannis because he was still an allstar by 22. Saying he took a long time to develop puts an unrealistic timeline on the players of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Giannis showed flashes that he was going to be a star but for the most part, he was incredibly raw and not a tremendous asset. But you could see that if he put it all together, he was a potential star</p>

      <label for="lbs1kws" class="commentText"><p>He was still in the league for a while before then and blew way past all star status, wasn’t near his peak at 22.</p>

<p>Most players that become stars are much more obviously productive much quicker.  Usually being really productive at a young age is the minimum criterion for stardom. Kobe and, to a lesser extent, Kawhi are the only other stars I can think of that took so long to blossom and became superstars.  All three of them needed sustained and mostly linear rates of improvement lasting multiple seasons to touch stardom, Giannis improved in almost every single statistical category for at least five consecutive seasons upon entering the league.</p>

      <label for="lbsfkga" class="commentText"><p>The other guy answered with the newer doc that came out, but Mirin Faders bio on Giannis that came out in 21 has amazing stories from his time in Greece. He did have nba scouts coming to his 2nd division Greek league games, games where the old guys on the team would smoke cigs at halftime lol. But it was really only the bucks and hawks that were seriously interested.</p>

<p>Everything was done in secrecy so as not to give way the big amount of interest the bucks had in him, they even met in a secret place to talk to Giannis. All that being said, it was really just the bucks and hawks who were definitely picking him and the hawks ended up being a pick or two behind the bucks and we got him and a ring in the process. Kinda poetic they played the hawks on the road to that ring</p>

      <label for="lbru8c3" class="commentText"><p>I think you need to clarify exactly what you mean by raw prospect. People are answering Jaylen Brown, and while I agree he was a reach at 3 and raw in terms of shooting, he is certainly not in the same category as anyone you mentioned. He’s closer to the category of Scottie Barnes, so if you are going to mention Brown, then Barnes and a whole bunch of raw prospects succeeded. </p>

<p>But for me, I don’t consider that a true raw prospect. A true raw prospect from college would be like Peyton Watson, who has somewhat exceeded expectations.</p>

<p>EDIT: In the last few drafts, here are the names of players who I consider exceptionally raw (not saying they are the exact same archetype as Giannis though) </p>

<p>Tidjane Salaun</p>

<p>AJ Johnson</p>

<p>Bilal Coulibaly</p>

<p>Dereck Lively II (only on offense though)</p>

<p>Ousmane Dieng</p>

<p>Peyton Watson</p>

<p>Jonathan Kuminga (maybe but he’s probably a tier higher due to his G League play)</p>

<p>Kai Jones</p>

<p>Poku </p>

<p>I feel like these players are closer to the type of prospect you are looking for</p>

<p>He was still seen as incredibly raw and had started playing basketball at 15, moved to the US at 16, and didn’t start on Montverde right away.  He was drafted with the injury just because he was seen as the ultimate high ceiling player.</p>

      <label for="lbru3dt" class="commentText"><p>The sad part about Poku is that he was actually starting to crack the bench rotation early on this year before his injury.</p>

<p>Every few games or so Poku would have a play where you’re just like, “how the fuck did he do that, that was actually incredible” but 70% of the time he played poorly.</p>

<p>I hope the Hornets give him the opportunity to shake that label.</p>

      <label for="lbs2pnd" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is a true anomaly; a lot of people get that type of tag but it feels like they’re closer to Kawahi than what Giannis went through. Kawahi enters the league and then works to become a better shooter and a better offensive weapon. Most guys getting the Giannis tag should really get the Kawahi tag.</p>

<p>The big reason I differentiate is because what Giannis went through ain’t normal, the dude was big and lanky then got taller and packed on muscle at an insane rate. You can’t do that shit, he didn’t just work on his game but his frame developed differently than anyone expected.</p>

<p>The guys that are in the Giannis mold are the mid lottery to late first rounders who after the summer or first year suddenly grew more. That’s when you should be like oh shit this might have the same trajectory. But even then to really be in that mold you have to physically change on top of improving your game.</p>

Grew 6 inches in one summer, Drafted at 6&rsquo;6, just grew 2 more inches to 6&rsquo;8 this summer and is putting on muscle. Most likely won&rsquo;t be giannis but I&rsquo;d give him that same kinda tag. Had a highly efficient rookie season which surprised due to his low offensive skills pre-nba. In France he was on the junior team before getting moved up to the main squad with Wemby.</p>

Coming out of that year his shot, his handle, and his BBIQ were all questioned.</p>

<p>He was productive for a hustle player, but among the 5 guys who played between 889-1011 minutes for them that year (he played 939) he was 5th in win shares per 48. And thats on a team that couldn&rsquo;t get past 13 seed Hawaii in round 1. So its not like he was 5th dude on a powerhouse.</p>

<p>Giannis was also regarded as a project, but I wasn&rsquo;t comparing him to Giannis who was a different situation for sure. I was just saying - you can be a guy projected to 7-8 and still be a project.</p>

Hilariously, dude isn&rsquo;t even 30 yet and did just put up 25  and 9, 3 blocks and 2 steals against Montenegro in the Olympics Qualifying Tournament. Maybe he was actually 5 years away from being 5 years?</p>
