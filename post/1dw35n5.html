      <p>A lot of players that get lumped in that tag I’ve noticed have failed. Thon Maker, Dragen Bender, Poku, etc.</p>

<p>Has any prospect with the ‘Giannis’ tag succeeded in developing into a great player since he’s been drafted? <em>(obviously not as great as Giannis, but become a really solid player. Very good-All Star Caliber)</em></p>

      <label for="lbs1kws" class="commentText"><p>He was still in the league for a while before then and blew way past all star status, wasn’t near his peak at 22.</p>

<p>Most players that become stars are much more obviously productive much quicker.  Usually being really productive at a young age is the minimum criterion for stardom. Kobe and, to a lesser extent, Kawhi are the only other stars I can think of that took so long to blossom and became superstars.  All three of them needed sustained and mostly linear rates of improvement lasting multiple seasons to touch stardom, Giannis improved in almost every single statistical category for at least five consecutive seasons upon entering the league.</p>

      <label for="lbru8c3" class="commentText"><p>I think you need to clarify exactly what you mean by raw prospect. People are answering Jaylen Brown, and while I agree he was a reach at 3 and raw in terms of shooting, he is certainly not in the same category as anyone you mentioned. He’s closer to the category of Scottie Barnes, so if you are going to mention Brown, then Barnes and a whole bunch of raw prospects succeeded. </p>

<p>But for me, I don’t consider that a true raw prospect. A true raw prospect from college would be like Peyton Watson, who has somewhat exceeded expectations.</p>

<p>EDIT: In the last few drafts, here are the names of players who I consider exceptionally raw (not saying they are the exact same archetype as Giannis though) </p>

<p>Tidjane Salaun</p>

<p>AJ Johnson</p>

<p>Bilal Coulibaly</p>

<p>Dereck Lively II (only on offense though)</p>

<p>Ousmane Dieng</p>

<p>Peyton Watson</p>

<p>Jonathan Kuminga (maybe but he’s probably a tier higher due to his G League play)</p>

<p>Kai Jones</p>

<p>Poku </p>

<p>I feel like these players are closer to the type of prospect you are looking for</p>

<p>He was still seen as incredibly raw and had started playing basketball at 15, moved to the US at 16, and didn’t start on Montverde right away.  He was drafted with the injury just because he was seen as the ultimate high ceiling player.</p>

      <label for="lbs2pnd" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is a true anomaly; a lot of people get that type of tag but it feels like they’re closer to Kawahi than what Giannis went through. Kawahi enters the league and then works to become a better shooter and a better offensive weapon. Most guys getting the Giannis tag should really get the Kawahi tag.</p>

<p>The big reason I differentiate is because what Giannis went through ain’t normal, the dude was big and lanky then got taller and packed on muscle at an insane rate. You can’t do that shit, he didn’t just work on his game but his frame developed differently than anyone expected.</p>

<p>The guys that are in the Giannis mold are the mid lottery to late first rounders who after the summer or first year suddenly grew more. That’s when you should be like oh shit this might have the same trajectory. But even then to really be in that mold you have to physically change on top of improving your game.</p>

      <label for="lbs2qta" class="commentText"><p>People keep listing one and some prospects that were five star recruits and were productive for high major teams.  Pretty much opposite of Giannis.</p>

<p>Siakam probably closest bet, he has a somewhat similar trajectory.  In general, Giannis wasn’t that special of a prospect outside of the eye test, extremely rare mega raw prospects to hit and they usually have relatively low upside</p>
