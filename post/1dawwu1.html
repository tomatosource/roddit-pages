      <p>If a prospect was guaranteed to be a perfect role player, never making an all-star or all-nba team, but does everything a perfect role player would do—would it be enough to be #1 overall? Or is the risk of a prospect becoming a star too good to overlook?</p>

<p>edit: did not necessarily “earn” the first pick, could always have gotten it through earlier trades etc. Hope it makes for more intriguing conversation</p>

      <label for="l7o75zl" class="commentText"><p>I would argue that Klay Thompson was essentially exactly that. Big, strong wing that can play all-defence level on the perimiter, while being an outstanding 3 point shooting threat. Can&rsquo;t really build round him due to his weak shot creation and playmaking but basically the absolute peak of what you can expect from a 3 and D player.</p>

<p>Draymond too for that matter, you can&rsquo;t build round him but he will absolutely elevate your team playing his role.</p>

It got to meme levels how he could score 20 in a quarter on 1 dribble all the damn time because they were all catch and shoots. <em>And that&rsquo;s OK.</em> Every championship team needs championship level role players, and Klay was undisputably championship level with the role he played.</p>

      <label for="l7obnt1" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s his point. The best role players are all stars. But Klay played his role to perfection. Can&rsquo;t dribble, only ok at passing. All-time shooter and elite wing defender. Literally, the 3 and D wing every team wants. Klay would never be the primary ball handler. You don&rsquo;t give him the ball at the end of the game and let him cook. He gets open and spots up or takes one dribble before a shot or pass back out. But hes so good at shooting and was an elite wing defender that he could put up all star numbers with a guy like Steph handling the star player duties. Klay is not seeing 30 pt seasons as a first option anywhere. People would choose Prime Klay over Prime Harden because you could pair Klay up with almost any legit star, not because they thought he was a better individual player than Harden. Harden needs the ball in his hands. Klay needs it in someone else&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>3&amp;D, especially the D part, isn&rsquo;t some small role. It&rsquo;s a huge task that gets underrated. If you can lock down perimeter defenders and be a shooting threat yourself taking difficult shots, you aren&rsquo;t a role player anymore.</p>

      <label for="l7ojedy" class="commentText"><p>The reason this is wild is because Klay wasent a 3/d player. While he was a phenomenal shooter and defender. He also was great at back door cuts, could post up smaller defenders and had a mean fadeaway. Also as we have seen with a competent big he is comfortable running the pick and role offense. His only weakness keeping him from being a top 5 ish player was his handling ability.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t even add that the warriors won multiple playoff games with Klay being the man when Steph was out.</p>

      <label for="l7ojxba" class="commentText"><p>It really comes down to how OP define the term &ldquo;role player&rdquo;. You seem to almost use it derogatory, where a role player is a 7th man at best. Whereas they seem to use the term literally, where the player has a very specific skillset and can only play a specific role for a team.  </p>

<p> I&rsquo;m not sure which definition is &ldquo;right&rdquo;, I feel like I could make an argument for either one.</p>

      <label for="l7nr5ln" class="commentText"><p>I don’t say this lightly, I know it gets thrown around a lot, but it seems like you genuinely don’t understand how basketball works. It’s not as simple as “guy is really good on this team as a 4th option, he would automatically be great on a team as a 1st option”.  Often times players are better <em>because</em> they are 4th options. If they had the ball in their hands at all times and had defenses pressuring them as a first option they wouldn’t be so good. White is a prime example of a guy who thrives specifically because he’s effective at making defenses suffer for having to focus on guys like the Jays or KP.</p>

<p>He’s a fantastic player, but he’s not an iso scorer, he’s not a 3 level scorer, he makes sense as more of a connective or supporting piece than a centerpiece.  To be an elite 1st option you need to be elite at either scoring or passing, or both. That’s it. Even as a role player white isn’t elite at either—he’s good, but not elite.</p>

      <label for="l7o3fy5" class="commentText"><p>Yep. A star can almost always do everything a role player can and more. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re stars and role players are role players. Basketball is no longer a sport where people hyper-specialize in on or two skills. The best players are generally elite in most areas. Even if you&rsquo;re the best team in the NBA you&rsquo;d still improve more by adding one star than one role player &ldquo;who fits perfectly,&rdquo; just look at KD joining the Warriors. They actually lost multiple role players and they were still a net positive.</p>

      <label for="l7ob0a3" class="commentText"><p>I think with the first overall pick you shouldn’t draft a role player but it’s not true that elite players are elite in everything. The stars are stars usually because they drive the offense and can create for themselves and their teammates. It’s probably the most difficult skill and that’s why it’s highly valued but it’s not everything.</p>

<p>Roster construction matters. You need that player to drive the offense but you also need rebounding, 3andD guys, rim protection.</p>

<p>Look at someone like Luka. He drives the offense like no one else but he isn’t anything special on defense and also doesn’t play great off ball. You need players to compliment his skill set. You couldn’t put a bunch of on ball players with him and think it would work. There is only one ball and you need different skill sets.</p>

      <label for="l7nplo4" class="commentText"><p>I disagree, he made Boston the perfect situation.</p>

<p>There is a lot of things to address regarding JT situation, iirc he was drafted to ECF exist team and Hayward just signed with so he wasn’t supposed to play that much, being that good and ready from the go.</p>

<p>Then IT injury come in and he was their best player in postseason that year, the very next Kyrie stunted his development.</p>

<p>He took a leap every season since so you got to give Tatum credit for his development because he was a major of why Boston is turning into a contender since two years ago.</p>

<p>No one had Tatum contending for a top 5 players spot before entering the <sup>2021</sup>&frasl;<sub>2022</sub>.</p>

      <label for="l7ndqlp" class="commentText"><p>I disagree with a lot of the other comments.</p>

<p>Sure, in almost all other drafts your prioritise ceiling when picking this high.</p>

<p>But in this one? You can only choose from what&rsquo;s available. And there clearly is nobody who is a usual tier 1 prospect, and probably no tier 2 guys either (depending on how you rate it).</p>

<p>Out of the rough top 5 of Sarr, Risacher, Shepherd, Castle and Clingan - are you betting money on any of them individually to make multiple all star games? Even 1? Is not &ldquo;perfect role player&rdquo; basically a 95% ceiling for any of these guys?</p>

<p>Maybe you think Holland or Dillingham look more prototypically like a future all star. But do you expect/predict that outcome? Hell no, I&rsquo;m not.</p>

<p>If you can garauntee your pick to reach that &ldquo;perfect role player&rdquo; level? I think that guy is the clear number 1 in this draft.</p>

<p>If the draft is weak and you have a superstar, the role player works, if you don&rsquo;t (and you&rsquo;re resigned to several years of being bad) might as well swing.</p>

<p>Should Shane Battier have gone #1 over Kwame Brown in 2001? Probably the last time we seriously had this question. Obviously the answer is yes, but that ignores Tyson Chandler and Pau Gasol.</p>

<p>For the most part taking a player as the first pick in the draft, really the first 5 picks, you kind of need them to be all stars. </p>

<p>I remember when the sixers took Turner at 2, he was actually a decent role player and it set the franchise back 5 years. But when we took iggy at 9 I think, he’s the ultimate role player, and really helped the franchise.  </p>

<p>If you get that high in the draft I think you always have to shoot for the best lottery ticket you can get. </p>

Calling Rodman a role player seems a bit disrespectful, but it was true he played a limited role on his teams without being expected to do more than that. Similar to how you wouldn’t really call Rudy Gobert a star but at the same time he’s a bit more than “just” a role player.</p>

<p>Draymond is the most interesting one. He does so much more than a role player, but at the same time, he’s not really a player who can do much without his stars.</p>

<p>There are different levels. MVP caliber (usually top 3-5), all nba (around top 15-20), all star (top 30ish) fringe all star (top 35-50ish),</p>

<p>Then you start getting into different level starters (high,average,low) and different level bench players (6th,7th,8th man etc )</p>

<p>My litmus test for whether a player is indeed a role player is: would you trade 2 players of that caliber for a generational star?</p>

<p>And I think I would trade 2 of prime Klay/Draymond/Rodman for a prime  curry / lebron / duncan / shaq / kobe / Jokic without a doubt.</p>

<p>However, I would not trade 2 of them for stars just a tier below that like AD/Garnett/Pierce/Dwight/Dirk/Wade/Harden/Westbrook.</p>

<p>Nor would I trade any 2 of the stars above for 1 generational star (with maybe the exception of lebron &amp; jordan).</p>

<p>A guy whose not a real allstar. Literally, on any team that wasn&rsquo;t the warriors with Steph, he&rsquo;s not an allstar even once in his career. </p>

<p>A perfect role player on the perfect team would probably still get voted to the game at some point tho. </p>

<p>Think Jeff Teague. Or Derrick White/Porzingis this year. These are all allstar level impact players, even if they haven&rsquo;t been voted as such (for White anyways) </p>

Players with “role player” skill sets at a sufficiently elite level don’t count as the “perfect role player”—you can’t get Korver or Gobert or Iguodala. Over <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of recent #1 picks have been all stars, so we’re trading a very high chance of getting a worse player (ignoring peak duration, since that wasn’t specified for the perfect role player) and all upside beyond that (the normal #1 pick is almost as likely to win an MVP as to be a bust, in the sense of never making the all star game.</p>

      <label for="l7obmxb" class="commentText"><p>What is the perfect role player? Is it the league’s best perimeter defender and the league’s best three point shooter? Basically, is it Tony Allen shooting like Kyle Korver? At that level of skill I may question whether that’s a role player, even though they fit the mold. But if that’s what we’re talking about, then yes I would. Anything else I can’t really justify the expense and opportunity cost.</p>

They are not good enough to be a top 2 player on a championship team, and they won’t make an All-Star team, but they could be your best player on any night, and they play their role about as well as you can.</p>

<p>If you had the first overall pick, you should be swinging for a player better than Derrick White or Aaron Gordon, no offense.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned though, if you get the first pick a lot went wrong for you, taking a support player(i.e a role player) would be asinine. Imagine if Detroit picked a role player, we&rsquo;d clown them to the end of time.</p>

<p>The Warriors picking Wiseman over LaMelo is a prime example.  It would be one thing if they thought he was BPA which would be wild.  However if they were just looking for a rim running big that protects the paint, they should&rsquo;ve just gone with LaMelo.  He definitely could&rsquo;ve contributed and would have been a good trade asset for them.</p>

It was considered a tossup between the top 3 and lots of people had questions about Lamelo (although were probably always underrating him a bit due to Lavar). In retrospect, that’s obviously not the case, but that year especially, it was very difficult to evaluate prospects (and it’s always difficult to determine who is truly the best player available).</p>
