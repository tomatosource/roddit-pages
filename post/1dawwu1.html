      <p>If a prospect was guaranteed to be a perfect role player, never making an all-star or all-nba team, but does everything a perfect role player would do—would it be enough to be #1 overall? Or is the risk of a prospect becoming a star too good to overlook?</p>

<p>edit: did not necessarily “earn” the first pick, could always have gotten it through earlier trades etc. Hope it makes for more intriguing conversation</p>

      <label for="l7o75zl" class="commentText"><p>I would argue that Klay Thompson was essentially exactly that. Big, strong wing that can play all-defence level on the perimiter, while being an outstanding 3 point shooting threat. Can&rsquo;t really build round him due to his weak shot creation and playmaking but basically the absolute peak of what you can expect from a 3 and D player.</p>

<p>Draymond too for that matter, you can&rsquo;t build round him but he will absolutely elevate your team playing his role.</p>

It&rsquo;s about the kind of things he did, not how well he did them. It&rsquo;s not an insult to call him the best role player of all time. It got to meme levels how he could score 20 in a quarter on 1 dribble all the damn time because they were all catch and shoots. <em>And that&rsquo;s OK.</em> Every championship team needs championship level role players, and Klay was undisputably championship level with the role he played.</p>

      <label for="l7p1ck4" class="commentText"><p>That Warriors team was full of players that wouldn’t work as well in other environments. In a lot of ways they’re a testament to complimentary roster construction. Neither Steph or Draymond reach the same heights without each other’s contributions. Klay benefited from Draymond taking some playmaking duties that he was average at for a player of his ability. Add the attention Steph drew to help Klay’s shot profile.
Both Iggy and Wiggins were miscasted as a number 1 and got to play the play a more optimised role for GS.</p>

      <label for="l7p2ugn" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying. My point is that if you were to build the &lsquo;perfect role player&rsquo; his skillset would basically be Klay. You can rely on them to guard the best wing, make his defender work on the other end and guarantee him to make his 3s.</p>

<p>I know Klay was elite in his prime, he&rsquo;s one of my favourite players. Being a role player or saying he has a role player skillset isn&rsquo;t a slight.</p>

<p>The perfect role player doesn&rsquo;t exist because flaws in key areas like shot creation are why they are role players to begin with. But if they did they wouldn&rsquo;t be too far off Klay in terms of defence and shooting. That&rsquo;s what makes the whole premise flawed because if you were guaranteed to draft Klay number one its a no brainer.</p>

<p>I think this is people interpreting the question differently. There are people that see it as would you be happy with a Derrick White with a first pick, where I see it as a perfect roleplayer would be someone that contributes at an extremely high level but lacks the key superstar attributes like scoring, iso shot creation and playmaking. But that player already existed and it was Klay or Draymond.</p>

      <label for="l7o6t7l" class="commentText"><p>Ya. The premise of this post is silly in my opinion. Famous 6th men of the year have all star level production and sneak on there sometimes. Peak Kyle korver was absolutely a role player, but if you have 10 seasons of peak Korver he is I the hall of fame</p>

      <label for="l7p9rql" class="commentText"><p>I was thinking about OG and AG, but those guys aren&rsquo;t perfect role players because they have real flaws in their games.</p>

<p>If you make OG a faster decision maker/better ball mover, he probably moves full on into star territory.</p>

<p>If you make AG an high quality 3-point shooter, the Nuggets have a big 3 and Murray might not be the number 2.</p>

Derrick White is not even close to a role player. He’s a starter for one thing, an incredible defensive player all round, and an extremely capable offensive player too.</p>

      <label for="l7nr5ln" class="commentText"><p>I don’t say this lightly, I know it gets thrown around a lot, but it seems like you genuinely don’t understand how basketball works. It’s not as simple as “guy is really good on this team as a 4th option, he would automatically be great on a team as a 1st option”.  Often times players are better <em>because</em> they are 4th options. If they had the ball in their hands at all times and had defenses pressuring them as a first option they wouldn’t be so good. White is a prime example of a guy who thrives specifically because he’s effective at making defenses suffer for having to focus on guys like the Jays or KP.</p>

<p>He’s a fantastic player, but he’s not an iso scorer, he’s not a 3 level scorer, he makes sense as more of a connective or supporting piece than a centerpiece.  To be an elite 1st option you need to be elite at either scoring or passing, or both. That’s it. Even as a role player white isn’t elite at either—he’s good, but not elite.</p>

      <label for="l7p9q4i" class="commentText"><p>Nah.  Nets Bridges is actually better than Suns Bridges.  Difference is he gets so much more defensive attention on the Nets, and he&rsquo;s asked to do more which has cratered his defense.  That&rsquo;s what almost every role player will look like when you turn them from a number 3 option to number 1.  And that&rsquo;s why even though guys like him and Derrick White should still grade out to top 40 players, they can&rsquo;t be number 1 picks.  They benefit so much from being allowed to go 1 on 1 against the third best defender instead of getting the best defender and occasional doubles.</p>

<p>Why would it be a big deal if you got another #1 pick? Expecting a franchise turnaround in one season is kinda crazy.</p>

      <label for="l7o3fy5" class="commentText"><p>Yep. A star can almost always do everything a role player can and more. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re stars and role players are role players. Basketball is no longer a sport where people hyper-specialize in on or two skills. The best players are generally elite in most areas. Even if you&rsquo;re the best team in the NBA you&rsquo;d still improve more by adding one star than one role player &ldquo;who fits perfectly,&rdquo; just look at KD joining the Warriors. They actually lost multiple role players and they were still a net positive.</p>

      <label for="l7ob0a3" class="commentText"><p>I think with the first overall pick you shouldn’t draft a role player but it’s not true that elite players are elite in everything. The stars are stars usually because they drive the offense and can create for themselves and their teammates. It’s probably the most difficult skill and that’s why it’s highly valued but it’s not everything.</p>

<p>Roster construction matters. You need that player to drive the offense but you also need rebounding, 3andD guys, rim protection.</p>

<p>Look at someone like Luka. He drives the offense like no one else but he isn’t anything special on defense and also doesn’t play great off ball. You need players to compliment his skill set. You couldn’t put a bunch of on ball players with him and think it would work. There is only one ball and you need different skill sets.</p>

<p>Sure, in almost all other drafts your prioritise ceiling when picking this high.</p>

<p>But in this one? You can only choose from what&rsquo;s available. And there clearly is nobody who is a usual tier 1 prospect, and probably no tier 2 guys either (depending on how you rate it).</p>

<p>Out of the rough top 5 of Sarr, Risacher, Shepherd, Castle and Clingan - are you betting money on any of them individually to make multiple all star games? Even 1? Is not &ldquo;perfect role player&rdquo; basically a 95% ceiling for any of these guys?</p>

<p>Maybe you think Holland or Dillingham look more prototypically like a future all star. But do you expect/predict that outcome? Hell no, I&rsquo;m not.</p>

<p>If you can garauntee your pick to reach that &ldquo;perfect role player&rdquo; level? I think that guy is the clear number 1 in this draft.</p>

<p>The Spurs right now: probably. They don&rsquo;t need a superstar. They need role players.</p>

<p>The Wizards: probably not. They have some role players, they need high end talent.</p>

<p>If the draft is weak and you have a superstar, the role player works, if you don&rsquo;t (and you&rsquo;re resigned to several years of being bad) might as well swing.</p>

<p>Either give a name you think reaches that bar, suggest a realistic trade with that level value- or - you will have to accept that you need to change your expectations.</p>

<p>Why do you think there are all these talks of Atlanta trying to trade the pick? Everyone knows it&rsquo;s not a usual draft at the top, and you just aren&rsquo;t getting good value</p>

      <label for="l7n9yru" class="commentText"><p>Depends on the draft, honestly. In a very weak draft at the top (think 2013), I&rsquo;d probably take it. Getting an underperforming first pick that can actually still ball and be a great addition to any team is better than betting on the wrong horse in terms of stars.</p>

<p>If you have a bunch of role players on your roster than you would want to draft star talent, but if you have obvious star talents (shai, edwards etc) than you would want to draft the right complimentary player to them.</p>

      <label for="l7nu43m" class="commentText"><p>Who else is in the draft ?? If it’s this years draft ? Then sure. If it’s last years draft then obviously no. </p>

<p>For the most part taking a player as the first pick in the draft, really the first 5 picks, you kind of need them to be all stars. </p>

<p>I remember when the sixers took Turner at 2, he was actually a decent role player and it set the franchise back 5 years. But when we took iggy at 9 I think, he’s the ultimate role player, and really helped the franchise.  </p>

<p>If you get that high in the draft I think you always have to shoot for the best lottery ticket you can get. </p>

      <label for="l7obmxb" class="commentText"><p>What is the perfect role player? Is it the league’s best perimeter defender and the league’s best three point shooter? Basically, is it Tony Allen shooting like Kyle Korver? At that level of skill I may question whether that’s a role player, even though they fit the mold. But if that’s what we’re talking about, then yes I would. Anything else I can’t really justify the expense and opportunity cost.</p>

I&rsquo;d say that player is worth it if the draft class is weak. If a player averaging a consistent 18ppg 9rebs 4ast on 65%TS is still great. Maybe in his peak he could average 23/10/6 on 68%TS.</p>

So let’s imagine a slightly worse Rodman without the baggage, who was also a model citizen and an amazing leader in the locker room. He might go first in a really bad draft (like this year’s).</p>

      <label for="l7nkt0f" class="commentText"><p>Defensive stars who have limited offensive capabilities will always be put in a weird category. Calling Rodman a role player seems a bit disrespectful, but it was true he played a limited role on his teams without being expected to do more than that. Similar to how you wouldn’t really call Rudy Gobert a star but at the same time he’s a bit more than “just” a role player.</p>

<p>Draymond is the most interesting one. He does so much more than a role player, but at the same time, he’s not really a player who can do much without his stars.</p>

      <label for="l7nongs" class="commentText"><p>I think Klay and Draymond are both role players. Albeit,  perfect role players (in their prime).</p>

<p>My litmus test for whether a player is indeed a role player is: would you trade 2 players of that caliber for a generational star?</p>

<p>And I think I would trade 2 of prime Klay/Draymond/Rodman for a prime  curry / lebron / duncan / shaq / kobe / Jokic without a doubt.</p>

<p>However, I would not trade 2 of them for stars just a tier below that like AD/Garnett/Pierce/Dwight/Dirk/Wade/Harden/Westbrook.</p>

<p>Nor would I trade any 2 of the stars above for 1 generational star (with maybe the exception of lebron &amp; jordan).</p>

      <label for="l7odf91" class="commentText"><p>I think the issue is people seem to have a mindset of roleplayer or star player</p>

<p>There are different levels. MVP caliber (usually top 3-5), all nba (around top 15-20), all star (top 30ish) fringe all star (top 35-50ish),</p>

<p>Then you start getting into different level starters (high,average,low) and different level bench players (6th,7th,8th man etc )</p>

<p>A guy whose not a real allstar. Literally, on any team that wasn&rsquo;t the warriors with Steph, he&rsquo;s not an allstar even once in his career. </p>

<p>A perfect role player on the perfect team would probably still get voted to the game at some point tho. </p>

<p>Think Jeff Teague. Or Derrick White/Porzingis this year. These are all allstar level impact players, even if they haven&rsquo;t been voted as such (for White anyways) </p>

<p>Probably worth it if the team is already very good</p>

Players with “role player” skill sets at a sufficiently elite level don’t count as the “perfect role player”—you can’t get Korver or Gobert or Iguodala. Over <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of recent #1 picks have been all stars, so we’re trading a very high chance of getting a worse player (ignoring peak duration, since that wasn’t specified for the perfect role player) and all upside beyond that (the normal #1 pick is almost as likely to win an MVP as to be a bust, in the sense of never making the all star game.</p>

<p>So many 1st overalls don&rsquo;t become superstars. You take the best player with the first pick, regardless of whether they&rsquo;re projecting to be a star or a role player.</p>

They are not good enough to be a top 2 player on a championship team, and they won’t make an All-Star team, but they could be your best player on any night, and they play their role about as well as you can.</p>

<p>If you had the first overall pick, you should be swinging for a player better than Derrick White or Aaron Gordon, no offense.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned though, if you get the first pick a lot went wrong for you, taking a support player(i.e a role player) would be asinine. Imagine if Detroit picked a role player, we&rsquo;d clown them to the end of time.</p>

<p>The Warriors picking Wiseman over LaMelo is a prime example.  It would be one thing if they thought he was BPA which would be wild.  However if they were just looking for a rim running big that protects the paint, they should&rsquo;ve just gone with LaMelo.  He definitely could&rsquo;ve contributed and would have been a good trade asset for them.</p>

It was considered a tossup between the top 3 and lots of people had questions about Lamelo (although were probably always underrating him a bit due to Lavar). In retrospect, that’s obviously not the case, but that year especially, it was very difficult to evaluate prospects (and it’s always difficult to determine who is truly the best player available).</p>
