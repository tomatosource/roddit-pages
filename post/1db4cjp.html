    <h2>
      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1db4cjp/this_years_bos_team_in_genuinely_different_from/"><p>This year&rsquo;s BOS team in genuinely different from the last few seasons. For example, they were good at the end of close games all season ( 15.4  net rating in clutch situations). And their offense was one of the best in the last decade, even if you adjust for the league&rsquo;s offensive explosion.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I feel like a lot of people were expecting Boston to fall apart and lose once they met real competition in the playoffs, in the same way they have fallen apart and lost in the last few seasons. But this year&rsquo;s team in just different.</p>

<p>From NBA Clutch stats (<a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/clutch-advanced?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=NET_RATING), Here" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/clutch-advanced?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=NET_RATING), Here</a> is Boston&rsquo;s Net Rating (Points scored - Points allowed per 100 possessions) in clutch situations over the last 5 seasons:2019-20:: 4.4 (12th)<br>
2020-21: -9.8 (25th)<br>
2021-22:   -9.5   (26th)<br>
2022-23: 4.6 (8th)<br>
2023-24:  15.4 (4th)</p>

<p>And Boston&rsquo;s offensive rating in the clutch (120.5) almost matches their league leading overall offensive rating (122.2). So their offense kept humming, even in tight situations.</p>

<p>(They were even better in the playoffs, but that is just the Indiana series. Outside of that they didn&rsquo;t need to play close games).</p>

<p>As for the offense. Boston had the best Offensive Rating in the league (122.2). That rating isn&rsquo;t just good, it&rsquo;s the best ever in a regular season.</p>

<p>To which you might reply: &ldquo;Big deal, offenses have been getting more and more efficient, so the best offense any given year has a good chance of being the best ever&rdquo;. And to that I say: you are absolutely right. In fact, the second best offense ever was put up by Indiana this season.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s look at this another way. If you take all possessions by all teams, and average the points scored, you get 114.54. So that&rsquo;s basically an average offense in the 2023-24 season.</p>

<p>Boston scored 6,68% more points per possession than that average.</p>

<p>If you look over the 10 previous seasons, there is only one team that had more efficient scoring compared to the average of the league: the 73 wins 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, which scored 7,52% more efficiently than the league as a whole.</p>

<p>(This is basically from just going over seasons here: <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?SeasonType=Regular+Season" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?SeasonType=Regular+Season</a>, and doing some math.)</p>

<p>Even if you take into account the evolution of scoring in the NBA, this Boston Celtics team is still one of the very best offenses in the last decade. Paired with one of the best current defenses.</p>

<p>One extra bit, they also got better at turnovers. Here are the last 5 season:</p>

<p>2019-20:: 13.7% (8th)<br>
2020-21: 14.1% (18th)<br>
2021-22:  13.9% (13th)<br>
2022-23: 13.3% (7th)<br>
2023-24: 12.1% (1st)</p>

<p>And they have kept their turnover down in the playoffs too, with a 12.3%. Two years ago, when they made the finals and lost, their turnover rate climbed all the way to 15.4% in the playoffs, and to 17.6% in the Finals. (<a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;Season=2021-22" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;Season=2021-22</a>).</p>

<p>Dallas can still win (especially if Kyrie is more like himself in the next few games, instead of&hellip; whatever that was Game 1). But I think it&rsquo;s going to have to be because Dallas plays great, and not because Boston shoots themselves in the foot. They are just at another level this year.</p>

      <label for="l7ojltj" class="commentText"><p>People have been constantly bringing up what the Celtics did in the previous two years to justify why they&rsquo;ll choke in the finals etc., so it&rsquo;s probably worth pointing out the ways in which they&rsquo;re different as a team rather than just listing players. Same thing Mavs fans get annoyed with when you bring up pre trade deadline play on their part.</p>

      <label for="l7ok2r7" class="commentText"><p>If they didnt add Jrue and Porzingis, I wouldnt discount the possibility of them choking again, but they did add those players. It&rsquo;s too much talent for Mavs and most of the NBA to overcome. Tatum doesnt need to be a top 5 guy anymore like he needed to be on those past rosters.</p>

<p>But the point is, maybe people got used to Boston being in the postseason and having certain weaknesses. This years team did a lot to adress those problems and is just in onother level compared to the (very good) BOS teams of the last few years.</p>
