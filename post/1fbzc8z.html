</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>When it comes to the Hall of Fame, winning a championship is such a feather in your cap that it almost feels like part of the dress code. If you&rsquo;re going to make the Hall <em>without</em> a title, you have to be undeniably great.</p>

<p>Of course, if you had your choice, you&rsquo;d rather waltz into the club with the ring, the feather in your cap, and the full outfit on. For many of these future Hall of Famers, the <a href="https://histeria.fandom.com/wiki/Father_Time" target="_blank">clock</a> is ticking to get one. Here&rsquo;s a ranking of the older legends with the best chance to grab some jewelry.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(8) Chris Paul, San Antonio</strong> (<em>100% HoF probability according to basketball-reference</em>)</p>

<p>Chris Paul is the most famous example of a ring-less future Hall of Famer, but this season may represent a brief reprieve from that pressure. Even if Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs take a massive leap, it&rsquo;d be too much to ask for them to go all the way from 22-60 to a championship right away. More realistically, they&rsquo;ll use this season to gauge whether or not to turn on the turbo jets in 2025-26 (or wait instead). CP3 is only under a one-year contract here, but if it goes well from a chemistry standpoint, you presume that he&rsquo;d be able to hang on for that end game.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(7) James Harden, L.A. Clippers</strong> (<em>100% HoF probability</em>)</p>

<p>With the departure of Paul George and with all the uncertainty about Kawhi Leonard, it feels like any title expectations have abandoned the L.A. Clippers. In fact, their over/under is all the way down to 40.5. If the team can hang tough as a playoff team, James Harden (and coach Ty Lue) will receive a lion&rsquo;s share of credit for it. Still, getting over the hump and winning the entire title would be an unrealistic ask.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(6) Jimmy Butler, Miami</strong> (<em>73% HoF probability</em>)</p>

<p>After a few surprise Finals runs, it feels like the needle is pointing down on Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat. They finished 46-36 last year and their over/under is even lower than that this year at 44.5. Part of the issue with their team is that Butler can&rsquo;t seem to sustain a full season anymore. In fact, he hasn&rsquo;t played more than 65 games in any regular season since 2016-17. The playoffs are always a different story, but with the top of the East improving, it may be more difficult for the Heat to flip a switch.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(5) DeMar DeRozan, Sacramento</strong> (<em>46% HoF probability</em>)</p>

<p>Should DeMar DeRozan be included in the list of future Hall of Famers? He&rsquo;ll be borderline. He&rsquo;s quietly racking up impressive durability and volume stats (including 12 straight years of 20 PPG), but he&rsquo;s largely ignored. The Sacramento Kings are largely ignored. That sense of relative irrelevance is why his &ldquo;pressure meter&rdquo; is only mid-level.</p>

<p>Still, there&rsquo;s <em>some</em> chance of lightning in a bottle with his new club. In their 2022 breakout, the Kings went toe-to-toe with Golden State (at the time, the defending champs). To start <em>winning</em> those playoffs series, they&rsquo;ll need to charge hard and try to get a favorable seed again. With three stars capable of averaging 20 PPG, it&rsquo;s possible that they&rsquo;ll rise back up into that <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> range.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(4) Rudy Gobert, Minnesota</strong> (<em>26% HoF probability</em>)</p>

<p>We may have to reset our narrative around Rudy Gobert. He&rsquo;s often a punching bag in the player-run &ldquo;new media&rdquo;, but he&rsquo;s a 4-time Defensive Player of the Year and a likely Hall of Famer in my estimation despite the low basketball-reference odds. Of course, winning a championship would change that narrative completely. The Minnesota Timberwolves should be good, but will they be good <em>enough</em>? That question may depend less on Gobert (a fixed product at this point) and more on the upside of younger guards Anthony Edwards and Rob Dillingham.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(3) Russell Westbrook, Denver</strong> (<em>100% HoF probability</em>)</p>

<p>Give Russell Westbrook credit for embracing a Sixth Man role and trying to win a title on some good teams. Ultimately, it didn&rsquo;t work out with the Lakers, or Clippers, but now he&rsquo;ll have as good of a chance as ever on the Denver Nuggets. I don&rsquo;t really understand the chemistry fit from a basketball perspective, but given the limited bench, Westbrook should be able to soak up a lot of minutes and activity for the team in the regular season. His effectiveness in the <em>playoffs</em> will be the bigger test of the new marriage.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(2) Damian Lillard, Milwaukee</strong> (<em>99% HoF probability</em>)</p>

<p>The 2023-24 Milwaukee Bucks felt like a disaster. Damian Lillard was out of rhythm (shooting only 35% from deep). Khris Middleton wasn&rsquo;t 100%. The coaching staff was a soap opera. Yet, despite all of that, the team won 49 games and could have had a chance at a deep run if Giannis Antetokoumpo had been healthy. They&rsquo;ll get at least one more bite of the apple this year with their aging core, but the clock is ticking louder than a Hans Zimmer score. Lillard is 34, Middleton is 33, and Brook Lopez is 36.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(1) Joel Embiid (and Paul George), Philadelphia</strong> (<em>66% and 98% HoF probability, respectively</em>)</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Sixers were in a similar boat last year &ndash; despite James Harden&rsquo;s trade request and Joel Embiid&rsquo;s injury, they still won a respectable 47 games. If Embiid can play 65+ games with an actual supporting cast this time around, then they&rsquo;ll represent Embiid&rsquo;s best chance of winning a title in years. More than anyone else on this list, Embiid would get the most credit for the title as well. Paul George is a great complementary star and Tyrese Maxey is an All-Star in his own right, too, but this is Embiid&rsquo;s team. This is his chance.</p>

The Spurs get a vet to mentor the young roster, and then pick up another asset at the trade deadline.</p>

<p>The Clippers let Paul George go for nothing, and Kawhi left the Olympics for his knee. They have KPJ now.</p>

      <label for="lm8h4zk" class="commentText"><p>If everyone in the league is 100% healthy, I definitely have the pels and grizzlies ahead of the clippers. The loss of PG is gonna hurt the Clippers. The Grizzlies were the #2 seed last time they were healthy &amp; a healthy pelicans team is no joke either. Plus, you can&rsquo;t underestimate the addition of Dejounte Murray to the pels.</p>

<p>Also, as a Rockets fan, I&rsquo;m surprised you don&rsquo;t have more faith in your team. They showed a lot of growth last year, and they&rsquo;re still a really young team expected to get even better.</p>

<p>And the guy you responded to said a low seeded playoff team if you&rsquo;re going by his statement. That would only be 7 teams at most better than them (assuming everyone is healthy)</p>

<p>People are really forgetting how good the clippers were last season. Were the best team in the west at one point, ended up as the 4th seed. The loss of pg isn’t sending them to the play in.</p>

      <label for="lm9oinm" class="commentText"><p>Keep in mind that the West was extremely close last season. They were the 4 seed with 51 wins. The Pelicans were in the play in game with 49 wins. Even the 10 seed warriors had 46 wins. The Grizzlies should now be healthy this year.</p>

<p>Instead of looking at how many seeds the loss of PG will cost them, think about how many games the loss of PG will cost them. He was an all-star last year. If the loss of an all-star for nothing in return costs them even 2 or 3 wins, that could easily put them in the play-ins. If it costs them 6 wins, it could potentially move them out of the play-ins entirely.</p>

      <label for="lm5h6yf" class="commentText"><p>Dame is the most obvious one from the list to me. Bucks got a starter-level player for minimum, who&rsquo;s proven to work well with Lillard. Trent is also a pretty efficient corer on PnR. A straight upgrade over Beasley. They got Delon Wright and Taurean Prince, two solid backup pieces.</p>

<p>A darkhorse pick would be Harden. They actually have a decent roster: Harden/Dunn, Norm/Mann, Kawhi/Coffey/KPJ, DJJ/Batum, Zubac/Bamba/Kai. Dunn is a pretty good backup for Harden and was a necessary piece. Feels like not much has changed, they are still a contender <em>if</em> they can stay healthy.</p>

      <label for="lm53xdn" class="commentText"><p>It’s not AI, it’s a statistical model based on the careers of the guys who did and didn’t make the HoF (out of all those who are eligible).</p>

<p>There’s no guesswork or bias here, it’s just a computer trying out the exact factor that should be applied to each variable to spit out a prediction of HoF or not that best fits the available data.</p>

<p>As a consequence of that, the model will obviously struggle to figure out what to do with players whose career doesn’t match any retired player.</p>

<p>The model isn’t trying to predict who will have a HoF worthy career from here on, it’s predicting who would make the HoF if they retired today. And it’ll struggle with someone like Luka for example because there are no players in the database the model is based on that have a prime as good as Luka but also no longevity.</p>

<p>So for active players the model will tend to underrate peak and overrate longevity.</p>

      <label for="lm4zf77" class="commentText"><p>Which years in your opinion should he have won?</p>

<p>He’s definitely not like a top 3 coach in the league or anything but this idea that he’s one of the worst is crazy.</p>

<p>Lob city clippers, despite being entertaining, were never a contender. Idk why anyone expected Griffin or CP3 to lead a team to a title.</p>

<p>Kawhi and PG you can say he fumbled in 2020 but it’s not like those two played amazing in that blowing of 3-1 lead and they haven’t exactly done anything since.</p>

<p>No coach is taking the sixers to the finals or even ecf with Embiid hurt every year. I mean we seen it with Nurse, this sub thinks he’s a top 3 coach and he won as many games in the playoffs as Doc with more talent lol</p>

      <label for="lm673lf" class="commentText"><p>Dude, he’s blown a record 3 3-1 leads, 4 3-2 leads, 1 2-0 lead, and lost 4 home game 7s. That combined with a 30 year old Giannis who’s visibly declined on defense and a 35 year old Dame who frankly looked washed last year is not a good formula. Not to mention back to back 1st round exits as the favorite for the Bucks. Window is very likely closed.</p>

      <label for="lm69q3x" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is 29 and he didn’t decline lmao. Bucks starting 5 had the best defensive rating last season, who do think that was because of?</p>

<p>Dame is 34 and didn’t look washed at all lol especially when he became the first option. Was pretty clear he needed time to adjust.</p>

<p>We were the favorites in 2023 but Giannis was always hurt which you conveniently left out</p>

<p>Bucks were not the favorites against the pacers either.</p>

<p>It really seems like you just purposely added an extra year to dame and Giannis and came in with 0 knowledge of everything else to try and act like you know shit when you don’t.</p>

<p>Everytime except the last time he lost a 3-1 lead he had the worse team and Kawhi and pg didn’t exactly play well when they were blowing it.</p>

<p>Blowing a 3-2 lead happens all the time, that’s not some crazy lead. Kerr blew the first ever 3-1 lead I. The finals does that mean he’s overrated? And again, the last 3-2 lead that got blown was 2023 against Celtics, go look up Embiids and hardens stats in games 6 and 7.</p>

      <label for="lm4xeid" class="commentText"><p>It’s not a slight against Dame it’s just what these individual players have as their situations. I guess you’re right in that CP3 would be last in this list I just think it’s more likely than not he gets dealt to a team trying to win. Gobert and Russ are on WCF contenders, and I’d put Philly’s chances at making the ECF higher than MKE’s chances as it stands rn.</p>

      <label for="lm4ypj6" class="commentText"><p>Gobert chances hang heavily on Ant taking another step and becoming more consistent.</p>

<p>I don’t think people realize how bad Denver’s roster really is either. They have 0 bench at all, then you got 1 injury prone starter (Murray) and another somewhat injury prone (MPJ) that are gonna have to play a lot.</p>

<p>I don’t see how Philly has a better chance at a ecf either, they got two of the most injury prone superstars in the league.</p>

      <label for="lm510l1" class="commentText"><p>Frankly I just don’t see how MKE’s chances are better than Philly’s, that’s all. Embiid and PG are injury prone yes but Giannis and Dame aren’t the picture of health, Doc is not the coach you want in the playoffs whereas I know what Nick Nurse can do, and overall I think Philly’s roster is better built to sustain those inevitable injuries.</p>

<p>Denver’s roster is weaker yes, but unless they face Minny in the playoffs again I’m not counting them out of the WCF just yet. West overall might be better but the parity isn’t as wide and it’s matchup dependent as we saw in last years playoffs.</p>

<p>What exactly has nurse done? Won a chip when he had a stacked team? He still got taken to 7 by Bud and Brett Brown lmao. Nurse won the same amount of games in the playoffs as Doc with more talent.</p>

<p>Philly also has 0 bench.</p>

<p>As for Denver, I just see them as like the 3-4th best team in the west</p>

<p>Not saying Dame isn&rsquo;t a HOFer, but Rudy&rsquo;s probability seems really low compared to his.</p>

<p>I mean it pretty obviously not and it doesn’t seem like you’re very good at identifying AI then. Just because AI exists doesn’t mean that people have forgotten how to write more than a paragraph. Not to mention AI is horrible at pulling exact numbers and stats which his post includes. His top posts from 5+ ago look exactly like this with the same writing style.</p>
