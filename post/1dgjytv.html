He was basically the only one showing in the first Mavs two games and the best Mavs players in the 4 games. Even after the first 2 games where Kyrie was a Ghost, they were very careful criticizing him but Luka despite being the only Mavs showing up in Boston was trashed by American media.</p>

      <label for="l8sxa0q" class="commentText"><p>Oh, of course he can be criticized.</p>

<p>But going from &ldquo;MVP&rdquo; chants to &ldquo;this guy is the reason why our season fails&rdquo; (while there initially wasn&rsquo;t even reasonable expectations to even make the finals) in one single step is completely out of proportion.</p>

<p>It is nothing new that Doncic struggles against quicker guards and even if it looks bad at that end several times a game he makes up for that on the other end <em>and</em> that&rsquo;s the reason why they got Gafford and PJ in the first place to help. No Mavs loss has actually been on him as the main culprit, not even game 3. Even if he takes full responsibility in post game pressers you usually just need to look at how many open looks he created that were brutally bricked by his team, it is breathtaking how bad they sometimes shoot from the looks he creates.</p>

<p>Also, when he is bad from 3 that is usually not much of a problem (like today) and demanding that he does not shoot is idiotic: he needs the threat of making these shots (much improved 38 or so percent in the regular season on high difficulty, after all) to get in the paint as easily as he does. And no opponent wants him to sink his signature shot even when he is 0-4 at that point.</p>

<p>Sorry, didn&rsquo;t want to write an essay and if it is incoherent nonsense please forgive me (am dead tired&hellip; watched yesterdays game live from Europe despite having a schedule this morning, followed by a friends birthday where the lady met too many of &ldquo;her girls&rdquo; to leave at a reasonable time - haven&rsquo;t slept much recently ;-) )</p>

      <label for="l8syidh" class="commentText"><p>I mean I personally didn&rsquo;t take it that far. I isolated my criticism to how he carried himself in game 3. He also missed a lot of bunnies he normally makes. Those 2 things to me were enough to pin the loss on him. The other things he did well are expected of him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there have been some crazy takes out there. To me the 1st 2 games were largely on irving and &ldquo;the others&rdquo;. Game 3 Luka had a bad game in my eyes and a plus minus can&rsquo;t convince me otherwise. And again it wasn&rsquo;t just how he played but how he carried himself and acted. Complaining to refs and not getting back on defense. Committing emotional fouls after missing a shot or being upset with the refs etc</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a great player and was/is in conversation as best player in the league. He&rsquo;s going to get criticized when he has a game like that. That doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s still not the best player and reason the mavs are where they are.</p>

      <label for="l8tbh58" class="commentText"><p>Early on, in Lebron&rsquo;s career, he received some criticism too.  He&rsquo;s always held himself well, but back then, they&rsquo;d criticize him for deferring too much (i.e., not taking the winning shot).  When a team loses, and you had a chance to be the reason they could have won, you get criticized.</p>

<p>It has to do with the narrative that a star player has to come up big (be Superman) at the big moments that leads the team to a win.  Had the Mavericks won Game 3, I doubt there would have been complaints.  My feeling was that Game 3 went as well as the narrative could have went.  Both Kyrie and Luka scored well.  PJ had his share of points.  But, it&rsquo;s much easier to blame a guy that fouled out than the role players couldn&rsquo;t make shots.  Kyrie also missed a 3 pt shot after Luka fouled out and he didn&rsquo;t get blamed for that.</p>

<p>If Luka wasn&rsquo;t the number 1 for the Mavs or if he didn&rsquo;t whine so much, then maybe it could have been forgiven.</p>

<p>To me, points are points.  When a team loses, no one wants to say the other team was better.  Let&rsquo;s face it, the Mavs were down by a LOT, and to have it winnable in the fourth quarter should have been a miracle, but fans almost never credit the other team for being too good even if it feels like their team has to be perfect to win.</p>

<p>I would imagine that Minnesota fans didn&rsquo;t say the Mavericks were too good and beat them.  Instead, they blame their players for mistakes they made.  They want to believe their team has a chance.</p>

<p>Even in the Game 4 blow out, how many Celtics fans believe the Mavs were too good?  No, they&rsquo;ll say the Celtics were terrible.  I mean, points wise, that&rsquo;s true, but in single sports (like tennis), most people believe Federer was much better than other players in the top 10 (outside of Nadal and Djokovic).  He was undefeated against the number 4 player (Ferrer).  Everyone knew he was better.  Ferrer&rsquo;s game just didn&rsquo;t match up well (nor his mentality) and the guy tried hard.  But in team sports, it seems like the better team rarely gets credit.  Fans delude themselves that their team is competitive.  Even now, Mavs fans say &ldquo;win in 7&rdquo; instead of the more realistic &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll probably lose&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Why?  Because it&rsquo;s so much more exciting when it does happen.  Years ago, the Red Sox went down to the Yankees 3-0 in the post season, and fans reluctantly admitted that the hated Yankees had their number and they&rsquo;d have to wait another year.  The Red Sox eventually came back to win a few close games then blew out the Yankees in Game 7, then go to the World Series and win for the first time in nearly 100 years.  Fans were over the moon.</p>

<p>Then, the Red Sox would go win like 3 more times, and fans became complacent.  But I&rsquo;m sure had it been their only win, fans were thrilled they went through that experience of winning, and the way they won it, the unlikely defeat of the Yankees (though it is easier to come back from 3-0 in baseball compared to basketball).</p>

      <label for="l8t3hc5" class="commentText"><p>The finals are where legends are made in the NBA. From Jordan to Kobe and LeBron most of them don’t find success right off the bat. They have to find that extra gear of great offense and great defense and all the intangibles that will their team to win. Luca has shown flashes of that and certainly a great score but he hasn’t done the other things until the last game. Game four show that he is capable of it, and I hope to see him in future finals now that he understands what it takes</p>

<p>its hard to put into words how ruthless the criticism was of lebron in the 2011 offseason. even as a mavs fan, and a younger one, i was like &ldquo;damn this is pretty lame, lebron is really good lol&rdquo;</p>

<p>and it&rsquo;s a big reason why lebron&rsquo;s 2012 game 6 <a href="https://grantland.com/features/the-consequences-caring/" target="_blank">vehicular manslaughter</a> of the Celtics is one of the most epically <em>cathartic</em> sports performances of all time.</p>

<p>i think it&rsquo;s already been long enough that a lot of fans dont remember this, or werent fans yet. lebron was getting dumped on like a dead coral reef every single day for months</p>

<p>Something I don’t understand with US media. Why Luka is so criticized? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was getting nothing but praise before he acted like a complete bitch in game 3. Whining for fouls, committing horrible fouls then whining when they were called, and implied the refs were rigging the game against him when he fouled out. Just pathetic behavior from a dude who&rsquo;s supposed to be a leader.</p>

<p>his set-shot makes him better from above the break than PJ and DJJ fundamentals wise, plus he’s still a smart defender with a good enough handle to attack closeouts. Green has the same issue as PJ and DJJ (can’t shoot outside the corners.) </p>

<p>The issue is everyone not named Luka was ice cold shooting in Boston. I really think that early on the lights were too bright for the role players. They seem to have settled down and it made a tremendous difference in the way they play.</p>

      <label for="l8rcavz" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s one of the most terrifying feelings as a Mavs fan. It&rsquo;s not just Luka being out but part of it is because of who goes in.</p>

<p>Like when Luka is out it&rsquo;s usually some combo of Kyrie with Maxi, Green, Hardy, Exum and/or THJ. It never works. It&rsquo;s literally just two or three minutes of hoping they can hold a lead before Luka comes back.</p>

<p>Exum, Green and Maxi are fine when Luka is in there. But if there is ever a significant amount of time when THJ/Hardy get the ball we&rsquo;re fucked.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure Kidd tried a lineup like this early in the first quarter of game 1 in Boston before things got out of hand. It&rsquo;s part of why things got out of hand.</p>

Bc if the game is tight and it’s time for his rest….that 2-4 minutes could be the difference between getting blown out or staying in the game. That’s what makes me the most nervous. Kyrie has to be on point. Get over the Boston ghosts.</p>

      <label for="l8rsxiv" class="commentText"><p>This is the issue with heliocentric basketball see lebron, harden, and Russell teams everytime they leave the floor it’s the same. A lot has to do with roster makeup and play style of the role players all they’re asked to do is shoot and make cuts everyone once in a while. I do believe there was a reason that kristaps and Brunson were unable to play to full potential with luka. Even kyrie has sacrificed a lot of usage to him. Luka is kinda tough to play with unless you’re strictly a 3-D player. You as a player won’t be able to get in rhythm cause luka spams high pnr and if he doesn’t like it he will pass to his big just to go get it straight back. There was literally a point in the Timberwolves series where luka went four straight plays with passing the ball and just shooting a step back jumper. This isn’t a shit on luka post but rather observation of his style of play and why the offense craters when he is off the floor. Would love to see him do more off the ball whether that mean just spotting up, screening for others or just in general being engaged in the offense when he doesn’t have the ball</p>

      <label for="l8sqkg4" class="commentText"><p>I believe the opposite. Jalen Brunson and KP are very good next to Luka.</p>

<p><strong>KP and Brunson</strong></p>

<p>Jalen Brunson is a 2nd round pick in the same draft with Luka, he developed into a star playing next to Luka and get his 100 mil pay check from Knicks. He exceeded his potential.</p>

<p>Luka and KP are like 1A and 1B in the bubble, but KP couldn&rsquo;t stay on the Court and when he is playing he is nowhere near 100%. Celtics is one of the few teams that are so stacked they can let him rest.</p>

<p>Imagine the Mavs still had KP instead of Kyrie and he only played 2 game in the playoffs against the Clippers like it&rsquo;s the 2020. The Mavs would have to rely on Tim Hardaway Jr., which is a salary dump in the KP trade but ended up being the actual 2nd option of the Mavs when KP is out.</p>

<p><strong>Ball Handler</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s beneficial to have more ball handler next to Luka instead of 3-D players. Otherwise, the other team can just double team Luka and nullify his Iso-game. Luka also takes the pressure off the other ball handler. With or without the ball, the opposing team put their best player on Luka (so Luka setting screen is meaningless), he isn&rsquo;t a efficient cutter given his speed, but he is a good spot up shooter.</p>

<p>Trey Burke, Spencer Dinwiddie, Dante Exum and even Kyrie all revived their career &amp; reputation playing next to Luka.</p>

<p>Even in 2022, when Luka had a ridiculous usage, Jalen Brunson &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie are among the highest usage 2nd and 3rd option among playoffs team.</p>

<p>The narrative that Luka Doncic cannot co-exist with other ball-handler doesn&rsquo;t not match up with reality.</p>

<p>I believe it started with Dennis Smith Jr.&rsquo;s dropped in usage and point per game when the Mavs drafted Luka. There is truth in it because when Luka entered the league people do not respect his shooting as much, and Luka is not drawing double team. However, the real reason is the Mavs was no longer tanking so they no longer allowed DSJ to take low % shots.</p>

      <label for="l8szatk" class="commentText"><p>Heck, to your point you don&rsquo;t even have to go back to the 2020 playoffs with KP. If the Mavs have KP instead of Kyrie and he only plays 4 games before the finals like he did <em>this very year</em> the Mavs would&rsquo;ve been bounced a long time ago and people would be saying he doesn&rsquo;t work with Luka. It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s dominating the ball with all kinds of touches as a 3rd option on a stacked team like the Celtics either, his usage rate is actually lower than it was on the Mavs</p>

And often times perhaps it’s not worth implementing another system/paying another high lever playmaker completely for 10 mins of no luka/heliocentric star?</p>

<p>He was a full 21 points better in plus/minus going into game 4 than Kyrie, for example. And the momentum of game 3 shifted toward Boston at the end of the first quarter when Luka subbed out (they cut like an 8 point lead to 1), and Dallas never regained momentum until the 4th quarter run.</p>

<p>He had a seriously awful meltdown in the second half of game 3 but it just did not warrant the degree of vitriol and unhinged attacks that sprung from Windy&rsquo;s postgame tirade.</p>

      <label for="l8s9ugp" class="commentText"><p>It’s ridiculous tbh. In games 1-3 every time Luka would sit, the Celtics would get some easy buckets and then the mavs were forced to sub Luka back in to prevent the game from slipping away.</p>

<p>He’s the reason Mavs are even in this spot. Yes he can be better and shouldn’t be crying to the officials but without him Mavs are a second round team at best.</p>

People just dislike him and were itching to find a reason to shit on him for everything they dislike and being down 3-0 was a good one. Never in my life have I ever seen a dumber argument than the whole Luka&rsquo;s complaining is losing them the series. Do they think complaining actually puts points on the board for the other team or something? Or that being annoying negatively affects your odds of winning a game? Baffling dude</p>

      <label for="l8tgmp3" class="commentText"><p>As a Rockets fan, I couldn’t possibly care less about the success of other teams. I would actively root for all teams other than mine to go 0-82 if it were possible. There are some teams that I would love to watch fail more than others.</p>

<p>I was a temporary Clippers fan for the playoffs until PG stunk it up (and so did Kawhi but he gets the injury pass every season). Zubac was exceptional just like any big Harden has ever played with.</p>

<p>I have also vowed to temporarily root for the Nets as my East team starting in 2028 (after we don’t own their picks) for a year or two. Mostly because I’m so thankful for Tari Eason + 3rd overall in 2024 + pick swaps in 2025 &amp; 2027 + 2026 pick outright. But also because I owe it to them after I’ve actively rooted against them for the better part of a decade.</p>

<p>At least Jerry West was still competing against that stacked Boston team when he got the only FMVP on a losing team.</p>

He locked in last game and was serviceable on defense while being his usual otherworldly self on offense. That’s call he can be for now, but all the Mavs need is for him to be ok on defense.</p>

<p>Ironically, when he’s healthy and locked in, he’s actually pretty good on defense.</p>

Best players on the floor don&rsquo;t give up 5 on 4&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re bitching at refs or foul out with like 5 minutes left of a must win game. Yesterday&rsquo;s game was great because he worked on defense and didn&rsquo;t bitch. Look at the results.</p>
