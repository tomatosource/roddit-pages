</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Throwaway for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 35 and the mother to a 19 year old girl. We live in a state where abortion is legal. I had my daughter very young and I don&rsquo;t regret it, but I would never encourage it due to how hard it was. I had little to no support and I would never wish the pain I went through on anyone. My daughter&rsquo;s father passed when I was pregnant and she has no step father. It has always just been the two of us. I was kicked out of my home the second my family found out that I was pregnant, no questions asked, and we haven&rsquo;t been in contact since then. I&rsquo;ve since moved halfway across the country, and I will not ever be reconciling.</p>

<p>My daughter has been dating her boyfriend for roughly 4 years now. Her boyfriend is the same age as her and not a bad kid, but he is still a child in my eyes. They both are. Her boyfriend still lives with his parents and refuses to go to college. My daughter wanted to be a nurse but is now deciding that she won&rsquo;t pursue a career because she wants to be a SAHM forever. She would&rsquo;ve been going to school this fall, but decided to unenroll before it began.</p>

<p>When my daughter came to me two weeks ago telling me that she&rsquo;s 2 months pregnant I sat her down. I did not want her to go through the same things I went through. I asked her how this happened and she said that it was planned. She and her boyfriend mutually decided that they wanted to be parents and this horrified me because she knows all about the struggle we went through together and that I went through alone. I regretfully called her stupid and was upset, but told her that we can work through this together. Since she decided that she was keeping this baby, I gave her stricter rules, told her how it works, told her what&rsquo;s going to change, and that she will be getting an education under my roof. These terms are nonnegotiable.</p>

<p>My daughter did not like these terms. She fully expected me to allow her boyfriend to move in (who is unemployed, by the way), give her her college fund as money to spend on the baby, the two of them as a couple, and whatever else she wants, not pursue an education, and still go out whenever she wanted. I told her that I will watch her baby when she&rsquo;s at school and for a few hours a day when she does homework. I also said that I will watch her baby on Saturdays and Saturdays alone so that she can still have fun and be somewhat of a teenager. I wish that I was given one day out of the week to recharge, take a break from being a mom, and enjoy my childhood. I know that this is very lenient, but I love my daughter.</p>

<p>We ended up arguing almost every day since and my daughter&rsquo;s demands have gotten out of hand. She claims that they&rsquo;re very unfair and I told her to look up what teen pregnancy is like and what motherhood is all about because the conditions and rules that I gave her are very, very lax. I told her that if she will not abide by these rules, then she&rsquo;ll have to live with her boyfriend&rsquo;s family. She cried and yelled at me, but I put my foot down. She ended up moving out three days ago. We&rsquo;ve never had a fight like this. We&rsquo;ve argued about petty things such as sleepovers and parties, but it was always resolved within a few hours and was never serious like this. I&rsquo;ve texted her multiple times that if she changes her mind on the pregnancy or the rules then she&rsquo;s more than welcome back home and that I will always love her no matter what she chooses. I also told her that she&rsquo;ll always be my baby girl and that I didn&rsquo;t want her to go, but we have no space for a full family and being a mother means that your entire life will change.</p>

<p>My heart aches. I love my daughter and feel like I failed her as a mother despite being so involved. She knows all about safe sex, was never bullied, we were basically best friends (though I am still her mother and she has always known that. It isn&rsquo;t just fun. I do discipline her when I have to and we get along amazingly), and we do everything together. I never thought this would happen. She had no better reason to get pregnant than &ldquo;I wanted to be a mom and I&rsquo;m ready&rdquo; but she isn&rsquo;t thinking about what a mother actually does. I know I made single motherhood look &ldquo;easy&rdquo; but it never was. I worked two-three jobs for the majority of my life and didn&rsquo;t eat some days so that my daughter never went hungry and always had nice clothes. I only finally got a &ldquo;real&rdquo; job as a nurse 2 years ago after being in and out of school for over a decade.</p>

<p>AITA for kicking her out? I thought that this was the best thing to do to teach her that things will be changing. I want her to come home, I really do, but if she won&rsquo;t accept these new rules and understand that motherhood is not easy, I can&rsquo;t just let her back in willingly. I feel like such an asshole.</p>

<p> As soon as I got to the part where they mutually agreed to be parents I was completely appalled. Neither of them have an income or their own home and just expect their PARENTS to be the parents while they still get to be kids?? The daughter doesn&rsquo;t even want to get an education anymore but wants op to just HAND the college money over to &ldquo;spend on the baby&rdquo;?</p>

<p> BS, If they still wanna be kids they shouldn&rsquo;t have decided to bring another child into the world wtf. 😒</p>

<p> This isn&rsquo;t a fucking puppy or a tomagachi ffs it&rsquo;s a human being. They will blow that money and op and the other grandparents will be scrambling to even get the car seat to bring the baby from the hospital, nevermind all the other necessities like a bassinet, clothes, etc.</p>

<p>But hey, baby clothes are cute so maybe daughter will at least splurge a little on that, right?? Playing dress up is totally fun 😒</p>

      <label for="l6e5uo8" class="commentText"><p>Completely agree. These 2 tried to baby trap OP, so to speak. If their grand plan was to move in with OP so she could provide everything, then <em>that</em> should have been a pre-preggers convo. But of course they thought she’d cave if the bun was already in the oven. </p>

<p>Which pretty much proves neither one of them is mentally or financially ready to be a parent. Maybe OP should put together a breakdown of what it will cost these two to provide for a child until it’s old enough for kindergarten</p>

Baby isn&rsquo;t here yet, which is why I assume the previous poster said a year. And you&rsquo;re both right,  they won&rsquo;t last, but by then it will be too late and an Innocent baby will be paying for it. I am sure at that point OP will end up at the very least with the baby to take care of, which will be very sad, but who wants to leave their grand baby on the street&hellip; Which I&rsquo;m sure the daughter will be counting on.

I actually think the OP&rsquo;s rules were pretty freaking lenient and awesome. Some people though, they don&rsquo;t learn from their parents&rsquo;, friends&rsquo;, or whatever mistakes. They need to screw themselves over in order to learn the hard way.</p>

<p>OP in no way has to take on this responsibility, again, if she chooses not to.</p>

<p>But giving a baby up for adoption is hard, and there is another path that also doesn&rsquo;t involve OP doing all the work and providing all the financial support.  The daughter made this mistake.  The daughter should be chasing down every bit of federal and state assistance out there, starting now.  She is 19, about to be a single parent, and needs a reality check.</p>

<p>OP, develop even tougher boundaries and conditions.  &ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t like the first deal because you felt entitled to my free labor and money?  How about these apples?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do not do all the work here.  Do not derail your life.  She&rsquo;ll just have more kids.</p>

<p>And that education fund is yours, BTW.  Add it to your retirement funds.</p>

<p>I would love to have been a fly on the wall when they were talking about becoming parents. <em>Just because you both consent to being parents does not make this a planned pregnancy.</em></p>

<p>There is no safety net, financial or otherwise. NTA mom is now not going to offer support (and those rules were lenient), and I wonder if his parents even know? Will they continue supporting both these young adults if neither have a job or go to college?</p>

<p>No accounting for what if the child is born disabled? Not knocking disabled kids as it&rsquo;s not their fault, but I have seen the stress of raising a child with disabilities because often the money and health support systems that supposedly exist to make their lives easier, do not actually function. It would be a nightmare, even for adults ten to twenty years their senior. The extra needs of even an ablebodied and neurotypical child can destroy whole relationships.</p>

<p>this was devastating to read honestly I feel for this child and it hasn&rsquo;t even been born yet</p>

<p>ETA: I was not disabled legally as a child, but I had and have health issues physical and mental that really destroyed my ability to function especially now as an adult. I am now disabled as an adult, legally and getting SSI.</p>

<p>Arguably there are people out there who are more disabled than I am and get along on their day to day and manage themselves better than I do, and I am proud to see they don&rsquo;t let it stop them from living fully! Depression and anxiety often revolving around ableism really seems to create more barriers than just having the physical aspect of any disability.</p>

My mom once called me the million dollar baby because she got pre eclampsia and I ended up being born premature. Between her and my hospital bills we racked up the charges. I was in the NICU for like three months and needed continuous extra care for years.</p>

<p>At that time at least I wasn’t considered disabled just had some developmental delays n learning difficulties. Only became disabled in the past 5 years or so due to developing several new health problems, unclear if there’s any relation to birth circumstances given there isn’t a ton of research on premies later in life.</p>

<p>Hell, my cousin’s baby was born a few weeks early and though is substantially healthier than I was, she still needed some extra hospital time. Babies in general are expensive, god forbid they get sick or have any kind of unforeseen problems that cost more thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Believe you me I would have aborted had I found out sooner, but I could not live with myself having an abortion that late into pregnancy.

<p>It was a huge struggle, we lost our apartment and were couch surfing during the pregnancy. As soon as the baby came we used what money we had to pay to rent a hotel room until we finally got into our house 5-6 months later. That was a solid 8 years ago. I don&rsquo;t regret my son at all, or either of my other 2 but Even planning a pregnancy doesn&rsquo;t mean it will work out how you want. Sometimes life just wants to punch you so hard in the gut that you blow chunks. </p>

<p>For these kids to treat planning something so important with such casual borderline indifference is so frustrating. They don&rsquo;t even have a plan beside &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get pregnant and then have our parents help with it&rdquo; </p>

<p>Too many brats see a ‘popular’ video and just assume things are really like that. I bet they think those cutaways in shows are literally happening right then and there.</p>

<p>I’ve always felt like we do a vast disservice sheltering our children from the horrors of the world. They need to see and experience the soul crushing nature of things, in small doses.</p>

<p>To kind of inoculate them from the spoilt brat bs of tiktok/generic trashy social media propaganda. They are children and think the universe revolves around them. Like a child at a store having a pampered fit being told not to climb an unstable display, as an about 10-13 yr old, smfh.</p>

<p>I’ve felt for years that working in retail for 2 years while going through army reserve should be mandatory after high school.</p>

<p>Really show how little the world cares and how others will view you. Doesn’t matter if they fail out. Just having made a remotely honest, by independent opinion, try would be enough. Some idiot parents will never accept that their perfect angels were not jesus 2: electric boogaloo.</p>

<p>If it breaks some… well it’s better now than with a family and their own children dependent on them. Just a dose off reality to temper the insane rambling of some spoilt brats.</p>

OP taught her all about safe sex and the difficulties of being a very young mother.  The daughter and her unemployed and uneducated BF ignored this because they WANTED to be parents. But they don&rsquo;t want to be real parents - they want mom to do everything.  And the college fund mom has been saving since daughter was born - it would be gone in a month if OP gave it to the parents to be. NTA.  If they want to be parents then they can get jobs and be parents.</p>

      <label for="l6e2u3e" class="commentText"><p>As an aside it’s crazy to me how many young people feel so entitled to the college fund. They treat it like a blank check they should get to use on whatever they want, but in most all cases it’s basically just money your parents set aside so they could afford to help handle college expenses for you. It’s still their money. So many kids I grew up with wanted their parents to just hand it over so they could buy a nice car (and honestly probably expected their parents to still pay for college if they changed their mind later)</p>

His reasoning was exactly that, he doesn’t want any of the grandkids to feel entitled to some money, he wants to support their education if they choose that path.</p>

The craziest part of the story is that daughter expected to be a SAHM, with an unemployed partner, and had no plans to actually take care of the kid.  This is beyond delusional. Good thing OP is young cause one way or the other she&rsquo;s going to be raising that child by herself eventually.</p>

I’m horrified for OP that her daughter is this clueless and selfish.</p>

      <label for="l6dvyzd" class="commentText"><p>what’s even crazier about this is that’s basically what op is offering to do, she’s just putting certain conditions on doing so in order to make sure her daughter at least has an education when this all goes tits up for her. absolutely insane she would turn her nose up at that kind of support just because the condition is that she has to go to school (which is paid for already. and therefore another favor that she is receiving from her mother). very few pregnant 19 year olds have this kind of opportunity to set their lives up for success regardless of being on a more difficult path. i bet if you looked in one ear you’d be able to see straight through the other ear! girl has not made one single smart decision</p>

      <label for="l6dx7a3" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, young girls and women far too often make drastic decisions and have personality changes due to their partners. I hope the daughter wakes up and realizes the harm she will cause to herself, her child, and everyone around her. We all might kind of shake our heads, but an actual life is being brought into the world in this mess, all because she has no idea who she is or how life works.</p>

      <label for="l6dubgg" class="commentText"><p>I want to know whose health insurance the daughter is on. Our pregnancy / birth / postpartum journey was <span class="math inline">\(25k *out of our pocket* (insurance covered the remaining \)</span>40k) - and that&rsquo;s not even including the $350/mo we pay each month for the privilege to <em>have</em> insurance. Plus, add on the usual financial suck (diapers, car seats, formula/bottles if EBF doesn&rsquo;t work out, etc.) you have with any infant.</p>

<p>OP sounds like someone who has very generously broken her back to shield her daughter from the harsh reality of how <em>awfully</em> expensive adulthood is and has no grasp on reality.</p>

It was sooo expensive and that was 13 years ago.

For example, she assumed she would have her college money to blow away, but had clearly given no thought to what will happen once the money runs out. It’s unrealistic to expect you to support her and her unemployed boyfriend indefinitely. And what about paying for her baby’s future education? It’s hard to get a well paying job with only a high school education.</p>

If the boyfriend got a job, would you allow him to live there if he paid rent or something? So that way both parents would be in the same home? It’s pretty much impossible to be a stay at home mom or dad nowadays unless one partner is making really good money. She realizes that right? You’re offering her a place for her and the baby to stay, money to attend school, free day care… most single moms would jump at the chance for that arrangement. I’d give her time because she’s very young and she’s probably not thinking through everything. Right now her thought process is probably “boyfriend + baby + stay at home all day = happy fun times with roses and gummy bears”. We both know that’s not the reality.</p>

I do not want them to be split up, but if he got a job or went to college or decides to pursue a trade I&rsquo;d be more than happy to figure something out. I wouldn&rsquo;t charge anything outrageous and would also help with baby expenses and helping them with government aid, but I can&rsquo;t just allow him to move in with no goals in sight and no money. I don&rsquo;t make enough for that, and even if I did, I would not allow it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what his parents are thinking or going through at the moment even though I&rsquo;ve reached out. They have 6 children of their own so I know that their hands are full and children are always coming in and out. I assume that the story wasn&rsquo;t said in full, but I had texted them letting them know that my daughter is very welcome home and that I want all of us to figure something out together. They have not yet responded.</p>

Once your daughter’s due date approaches, I have a feeling she will reconsider and appreciate your generous offer of support. Im shocked the boyfriend and your daughter planned a baby based on their lack of motivation, I would be very cautious about letting the boyfriend move in regardless of his circumstances positively changing . You could still end up financially supporting all three of them and ultimately feel like a guest in your own home. I wouldn’t trust them to follow through on a job or education based on what you said in your original post.
Stand your ground, stay strong and best wishes to your family.</p>

At this age she CHOSE to have a kid without any realistic expectations about the cost of raising a baby (which is a luxury). This wasn’t an oopsie.

      <label for="l6ddeh2" class="commentText"><p>This is a tough situation but I think NTA.</p>

<p>You laid out a boundary and your daughter doesn’t want to follow the rules. You didn’t kick her out, she decided to move into a home she thinks will support her delusion of never having to work and to mooch off individuals alongside her boyfriend.</p>

<p>The boyfriend’s parents may support/let her live with them but I wonder how much support they’ll actually give her when the baby is born.</p>

<p>You laid out what seems very sensible and reasonable expectations of her having to learn to balance being a new mom but also still pursuing education to be able to be a functioning adult in the future. It’s a tough situation to be in, but I think it was smart to not let the BF move in because I doubt he’d find a job; but then again you could have gave the caveat he can move in <strong>if</strong> he pursued education or work, and if he didn’t he’d have to move back out to his parents. But that compromise is a thin line of boundaries getting tested and crossed.</p>

<p>I hope your daughter realizes you’re still in her court. Keep contact with her throughout the pregnancy, and hopefully she’ll realize sooner than later you’re trying to help her be successful. Because the delusion of being a “SAHM forever” when her partner has no income is far from realistic.</p>

<p>The rules you set down were pretty chill under the circumstances. You offered to help a lot with the baby. You didn&rsquo;t kick her out.</p>

<p>She decided that she wouldn&rsquo;t live at your house unless it was on her terms.</p>

<p>She decided that she was ready to get pregnant.</p>

<p>The reality is that as people age, the amount of influence that parents have steadily decreases. That&rsquo;s appropriate and healthy. But it does mean that when your kid gets a really fucking stupid idea lodged in their brain sometimes there&rsquo;s nothing to do. While it&rsquo;s an absolutely terrible outcome and your daughter has no fucking idea what she&rsquo;s in for, I&rsquo;m sure that baby will still be a little bundle of joy. Silver lining, right?</p>

      <label for="l6dwipf" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re right that parental influence decreases, the other thing that&rsquo;s new for this generation is social media influence. There&rsquo;s a ton of tradwife/SAHM influencers out there pushing people into a lifestyle that&rsquo;s not achievable, realistic or sustainable for a lot of people. They all wear pretty dresses and show videos in their perfectly clean, curated house where they make all their food organically from scratch and it looks so pretty and idealistic. The problem is most of them have a) an income stream from social media to fall back on b) nannies c) cleaners, or they only show one room, usually the kitchen or living room, that&rsquo;s spotless and beautifully decorated. They make it seem like anyone can stay home and have what they have but it&rsquo;s not true at all and a lot of women are being influenced by this and ending up in abusive relationships with no finances to fall back on.</p>

      <label for="l6ddwia" class="commentText"><p>I strongly feel that parenting a young adult is about making sure they don&rsquo;t wind up a couch potato. I think your daughter thought you would pick up all her slack and carry the weight of her pregnancy and child. You were right to set fair boundaries and not let her make bad decisions on your watch. You can&rsquo;t control her from here. Someday soon she&rsquo;s going to realize that what you offered was a really sweet deal. Just keep that deal open to her. NTA.</p>

If you watch the baby so she can live her youth on weekends you’ll end up with another grandchild, and probably other baby daddy, down the line. She made a stupid choice, she must face the consequences or she’ll never learn.</p>

I was freshly 20 when my girl was born, I was very fortunate that my mother would babysit for me on some weekend evenings so I could have somewhat of a social life, but I also had to pay her rent and take care of my own shit. Even earlier than I became a mom actually because I had to pay my way through adult ed on my own as a 17yo after I dropped out (I needed more support and had undiagnosed ADHD). I moved out when my daughter was 4 months old, and I was single. Shit was hard. Nobody had a single dollar for me much less a college fund. I feel for this poor mama.</p>

<p>The only issue I see, is the offer of babysitting.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to babysit for her. She chose her path, and the hardships that follow. The only people who should do anything, are her and her baby daddy.</p>

<p>The offer to allow him to move in (even if he finds a job) is also a set-up for a second baby.</p>

<p>Planning to be a SAHM with no income?  Planning to conceive with a guy that doesn’t have a job / financial means to take care of a child?  This girl is an idiot!  Translation, Mom is supposed to cover everything.  She didn’t learn anything from watching her Mom struggle to raise her.  Instead, she wants to keep things rolling and have her Mom pay for/ raise her baby as well.  Disgusting!</p>

<p>I wouldn’t babysit for her either.
This fairytale is gonna turn into a reality check very soon!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d take her shopping for absolute baby essentials (pack of onesies, box of diapers, wipes, bottle and formula, blanket, carseat and bassinet). Keep a tally on a calculator. Once the absolute bare minimum for the first week is in the cart, show her the total and ask how <em>they&rsquo;re</em> going to pay for it.</p>

<p>See if that kicks something into place and go from there.</p>

I’m here when you’re ready to talk.’ And leave it at that. She and her baby daddy have pretty unrealistic expectations and it doesn’t help that they’re probably feeding off of each other. Let her deal with the outcome and consequences herself. She’ll either rise to the challenge or she’ll fall and call you for help.</p>

<p>I personally think your rules were too lenient and generous. When she does come back, because she will, you should not be giving her that much free time. It allows her to escape the consequences of her choices so she won’t learn from them. It also gives her the free time to go amd create some new consequences. You should help with her child when she is in school, studying and sleeping and no other times. Anything more is asking for trouble. Also help doesn’t mean do everything.</p>

<p>NTA. You are a great mom. You raised her the best you could. Sometimes you can&rsquo;t teach common sense and reason.

I get that you love your daughter, but you agreeing to basically 100% of the childcare while she goes to school, lives for free, does not work, and gets weekends with her friends is one of the most insane things I’ve ever heard of. It makes me think she’s learned that she’s entitled to your sacrifices in exchange for no effort on her part for the rest of your life. At 19 she expects you to be her sole provider, maid, nanny, and probably her cook too. Even best friends don’t sign up for this. I’m sorry she’s so selfish and out of touch with reality. Clearly something went wrong along the way despite you doing your best (with no support). It’s time for her to grow up and get the rude awakening that is awaiting her. Good luck, OP.</p>

<p>I think this is going to be heartbreaking for you to see your daughter and grandchild suffer, but I think if you don’t let her figure it out, you will end up raising your grandchild and having your daughter freeload (and possibly her boyfriend, too) for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Please stay strong about that money not being handed over to her. I would caution you to never hand over money to them from now on. Pay for things directly, whether it’s tuition, groceries or baby supplies. If she feels she should be able to go out whenever she wants and that it’s ok to intentionally get pregnant when your partner is unemployed, I have zero faith that any money will be spent wisely or even on what she says it would.</p>

<p>I would consider speaking with the boyfriend’s parents and hearing what they have been told and plan on.</p>

<p>As someone else said, you didn’t kick her out. You told her what the rules were going to be. She didn’t like them so she left.</p>

<p>Youre a great mom and didnt kick her out.  She chose a different path and the fact you are still sticking by whatever option she chooses, while offering her freedom and independence, is highly commendable.</p>

Neither her or her BF working or going to school to get a career? Honestly, your rules are more than generous. She will either come back or end up at some low wage job to just get by. I doubt the BF’s parents will want them there forever with neither of them working. Those two need a hard dose of reality. Neither of them are ready to become parents.</p>

Does she realize somebody actually needs to be working for that to be an option?? And that someone isn’t you!! Keep her college money. Let them struggle and find out how much life actually costs. Her entitlement is pretty gross. I’m sorry your relationship with your daughter is changing. You’ve done the right thing here. Making this easy now means she’ll never work for anything and expects to be taken care of without effort on her part. NTAH. Stick to your plan.</p>

<p>She’s being an idiot, the boyfriend too. If they want to raise a child, <em>they</em> need to step up and be ready for that, not expect grandma to enable the two of them doing nothing productive.</p>

<p>He needs a job and she needs her education. If they elect to forgo that, well, that’s on them.</p>

<p>Wants to be a SAHM forever but has an unemployed boyfriend with no prospects? You are extremely nice OP, and your rules were very fair, but it appears your daughter has turned out extremely entitled because her plan is for you to be the provider and the mother. And the boyfriend was suppose to move in lol. She wants to take advantage of you.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t budge on your conditions. This girl is needs a fucking education and a job if she&rsquo;s going to provide for a child herself. If you budge, she will never mature into a mother. Time for her to grow the fuck up. NTA.</p>

You even agreed to watch the baby while she was in school and even to give her some fun time. If she won’t agree to that then she needs to have a dose of reality. Two unemployed teens planning to have a baby is stupid. Plain stupid. They both need a dose of reality. And don’t worry, you didn’t fail. You did the best job that you could with what you had and it sounds like you really did do a good job. You did it alone too and that takes extra hard work but you did it. She just made a dumb decision. But lots of teens make dumb decisions.</p>

      <label for="l6dpi1y" class="commentText"><p>NTA. You had completely reasonable and even lenient boundaries for her staying in your home, she didn&rsquo;t like them, and she left. She purposely is having a baby with someone unemployed and plans to never work because she&rsquo;s living in some fairytale world. Do NOT let her back when reality hits, and it will hit her hard, until she agrees to the terms that you set or you will be raising a newborn AND your daughter AND your daughter&rsquo;s shiftless babydaddy AND working full-time. She needs to learn some hard lessons and unfortunately you can&rsquo;t learn them for her. It&rsquo;s a purely experiential lesson at this point. Sending you hugs.</p>

<p>And please don&rsquo;t blame yourself. Some kids just get ideas when their brains aren&rsquo;t fully cooked and you are hardly the only influence in her life. Lord knows what the boyfriend or her friends or some Tiktoks she&rsquo;s been watching came up with to justify all of this.</p>

      <label for="l6ds6sc" class="commentText"><p>NTA.  You offered too much anyway.  Giving away Saturdays for over a decade? Just stop.  She made her choice and kicking her out is the least of what should happen.  You are not her daycare solution you are the exception to it! Meaning if she&rsquo;s old enough to be a parent she&rsquo;s old enough to find child care.  You should be the back up only.  She&rsquo;s got some lessons to learn.   And you need to let her learn them.  Your place now is to only be the Grandma. That&rsquo;s it. Change is always hard to swallow but it&rsquo;s up to you now to make sure that the boundaries are met and your new relationship thrives as a grandparent and not the parent. You&rsquo;ll need a strong spine&hellip; good luck!</p>

      <label for="l6dsd1z" class="commentText"><p>NTA. I’m not a mom, but my sister got pregnant when she was 20 and my mom offered her a similar ultimatum. My sister took her up on it which is good as her boyfriend hit the road when he realized how hard it would be.</p>

<p>I also just want to say, and while I don’t know you and your daughter, my mom also offered up regular childcare on the weekends so my sister could have a life. I think she lived to regret this. There became an expectation and with it grew some resentment. I think, if we could redo it, my mom would choose to stress the sacrifice of having a child, and that the burden should/would fall squarely on my sister’s shoulders for the rest of her life. My niece is 14 now and my sister has been out of my parent’s house for nearly a decade, but the relationship my mom and sister share remains broken.</p>

<p>Last, my niece was an absolute joy. The second she arrived we were all mesmerized. I know you know, but it’s nice to be reminded that through all the struggle and confusion, you get a new love.</p>

<p>Wishing your family the best!</p>
