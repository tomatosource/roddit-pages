Barthelona is in Spanish but if you actually want to make someone there happy it’s better to say it in Catalan (Barselona, but the vowels are pronounced differently), which is closer to how English people say it.</p>

      <label for="l77xagv" class="commentText"><p>Quality of living in Europe is much, much higher than in the US though. It is easier to live out a decent life if you&rsquo;re low-income in the EU vs low-income in the US. Prices for grocery items are much better and the EU is way more strict on what ingredients go inside processed food compared to the FDA (go Red 40!!!). Public transportation is an actual viable method to get somewhere because it is pretty efficient and much cheaper than a car (plus it&rsquo;s usually around <span class="math inline">\(5-6 per gallon of gasoline). However, salaries are much lower and equal in companies that are based there. Very rarely you will see someone with a salary higher than \)</span>100k USD so 40k-60k is considered the high-end of salaries (not high-income but for European prices, you can live comfortably enough).</p>

<p>Having been to New York, Chicago, Bilbao, and Barcelona - Barcelona&rsquo;s the best city to live in by far, no doubt about it.</p>

The OP said living in BCN is better than living in the US, which is perfectly fine, and you discredited that notion with only the &ldquo;north of Spain&rdquo; as a comparison, which is way off.</p>

<p>Reddit does hate the US, but this was not one of those cases. It&rsquo;s actually funny that you upheld the american stereotype by immediately getting defensive without having been to the city discussed, lol.</p>

<p>he looked absolutely devastated and destroyed in that video. Like I dunno, I’ve seen people cry tears of joy many times, and none of them looked remotely like that</p>

<p>This seems like he’s just trying to save Barca a bit of face bc he probably feels badly that ppl were interpreting his reaction as “damn he probably feels horrible that he now has to deal with playing for some shitty team in Europe instead of the glamorous NBA! Look at how sad he is about how horrible his life turned out!”</p>

<p>and felt self conscious about ppl in Barcelona thinking that he wasn’t happy with his experience there and him thinking about being forced to be there literally brought him to tears and and that he’d rather be in America. And this is his way of saying “no I’m actually very a grateful and happy to be here!” (Which I’m sure he is)</p>

<p>you&rsquo;ve never been going thru some bad shit in your life and your mom asks you how you&rsquo;re doing and you lie and say &ldquo;oh Im fine Ma, yeah everything is great!&rdquo; because you dont want her to worry or be negatively impacted by your feelings of sadness or anger or whatever?</p>

<p>literally everyone has done something like that at one point or another&hellip; Jabari lying about being sad in order to not hurt the feelings of those who he is grateful to in the Barca organization for helping get his career back on track is no different than that&hellip;</p>

<p>and like I already said, I dont even think he&rsquo;s lying about what he is saying in this clip. I think that&rsquo;s 100% true and from the heart (even tho he sounds like he has a gun to his head in this audio lol). I just dont think those were tears of happiness in the original video 🤷‍♂️ sue me.. you guys can simp for the PR statement if you want, doesnt bother me lol</p>

<p>I do it, you do it, we all do it. its incredibly common human behavior.. why would it be a stretch to think that is what&rsquo;s happening here?</p>

<p>he has a lot of gratitude and warm feelings towards Barcelona, and doesnt want them to interpret his tears as a sign of ungratefulness or anger signaling that he&rsquo;s upset or unhappy that he&rsquo;s been reduced to playing in europe</p>

<p>you dont need to have a psychology degree to understand that when you see someone breaking down like they were just told they lost a parent, with a clenched jaw, furrowed brow, and 1000 yard stare, they probably arent experiencing intense amounts of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;</p>

<p>that being said, someone generally being happy with their life, is not some magical preventive shield that prevents them from having any sad/reflective emotions at ANY time EVER&hellip;. and what I saw in that video the other day, was him reflecting on his career and understandably being overcome by emotion after reflecting back on his career and all the hardships he has been thru, and what could have been.</p>

<p>he was sad in that moment. while ALSO probably being generally happy overall, considering he lives an incredibly charmed life, gets to live in one of the coolest cities in the world, and has made more money than 99.999999999999999% of people in the world will see even 5% of in their lifetimes. both things can be true</p>

<p>but my comment was getting a bit long, and I figured you guys would get my point. I guess not 🙄</p>

<blockquote>
<p>barcelona fc is worth much more than most nba teams my dude</p>
</blockquote>

<p>very odd point to make, <em>my dude</em>, considering the soccer team accounts for 95% of that worth/income, and the basketball team doesnt really make very much money at all in the scheme of things.</p>

<p>barcelona&rsquo;s highest paid basketball player gets paid like 2 million dollars. how does that stack up to the highest paid player on the average nba team?? are you really sure you wanna keep arguing about this? lol</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barcelona&rdquo; as you are using the term, is a sporting club with over 20 sports teams so that seems like a weird comparison for you to make vs one NBA team&hellip;..</p>

<p>pretty sure if you made a big group of the Yankees, Knicks, Rangers, Giants, Red Bulls, Liberty, Gotham FC, Rutgers and St Johns, that &ldquo;club&rdquo; would be worth a lot more then most NBA teams (and most soccer teams) too, <em>my dude</em> ;)</p>

<p>you posting footage of him doing some random soulless podcast appearance from five months ago has literally NOTHING with him getting extremely emotional and sad a few days ago when reflecting on the end of his first season outside the nba. does literally NOTHING to disprove the point I&rsquo;m making any more than if you were showing me footage of his high school graduation ceremony and saying &ldquo;look how happy he is! there&rsquo;s no way he ever was sad as a teenager!&rdquo;</p>

<p>he gives some meandering non answer about 6.5 minutes in when asked about returning to the nba of &ldquo;well I dont know I guess Ill have to see where Im at and how barcelona feels when the season ends&rdquo; LOL. RINGING endorsement that he wants to stay in barcelona forever🙄</p>

<p>my takeaway is that its pretty clear that Jabari is not a particularly compelling figure on the mic and doesnt have many interesting things to say at all lol. beyond doing his best impression of what he&rsquo;s heard other media-trained pro athletes say on other podcasts and basically regurgitating those same generic talking points every time he opens his mouth</p>

<p>still not sure how this 5 month old podcast of him talking to some random lithuanian dude has anything to do with disproving my point that even generally happy ppl can feel sadness in certain specific moments but ok🤷‍♂️</p>

It&rsquo;s feasible to think something like that could have weighed on someone to the point of being depressed about it. It&rsquo;s good that he&rsquo;s keeping things in perspective instead of thinking that way.</p>

<p>“To continue on this topic: Can you imagine how much of an ego hit it must be to have already washed out of the league and your old teammates/friends group chats are still blowing up with stories about their ongoing NBA experiences.

      <label for="l784ffv" class="commentText"><p>There would be people in his position still crippled by bitterness of what went wrong, what might have been and jealousy of his former NBA peers.</p>

<p>And you see that in all walks of life. It&rsquo;s all relative. There will always be those better off than you and those worse off, so you can always be jealous, or always be grateful. And life, sooner or later, will put you through the ringer, it&rsquo;s a certainty, the question is how will you react to it.</p>

      <label for="l76t77v" class="commentText"><p>people on r/nba feel extremely comfortable calling anyone who is a bottom 3 or 4 guy on any given nba team&rsquo;s 12 man roster a bum (9th man or below). comments referring to players on this tier as &ldquo;bums&rdquo; or &ldquo;scrubs&rdquo; or  other similar such insults are regularly upvoted and mostly agreed with</p>

<p>by my math, that would mean that there are at least 120 bums in the nba, and probably more, considering these are mostly guys that dont play at all, and there are plenty of other guys that play regularly, who are also considered consensus &ldquo;bums&rdquo;. lets just get crazy and say that there is an additional 1 bum per team by this metric&hellip; that puts us at 150 total bums</p>

<p>so if Jabari cant even be like the 149th best bum in the nba, and cant even crack the top 3 in scoring on his much lesser than nba talent overseas team (he finished 4th on barcelona this year, with 10.3 pts on 8.2 shots 🥴)&hellip;</p>

<p>I sincerely ask you&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; at what point IS he allowed to be called a bum?? why is he so precious that he is completely bulletproof from being called a bum?? if he dropped to 6th leading scorer on Barca would it be ok then?</p>

<p>Dillon Brooks is called a bum every day of his life, yet he recently mad an all nba defensive team and averaged more points, assists, FT%, threes etc than Jabari Parker last year, while playing in an exponentially more talented league&hellip;. so why is it totally fine to call Dillon a bum, but not Jabari??</p>

He also wasn&rsquo;t too bad at 3pt shooting at the end of his Milwaukee tenure, he had decent efficiency. He was a way better shooter than Exum was before this year. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna be a sharpshooter or anything, but he could probably be a decent spot up shooter if he put his efforts into it.</p>

<p>Now defensively, meh. Probably gonna get cooked.</p>

      <label for="l76f0jw" class="commentText"><p>It is a shorter 3pt line, but their line is about the same distance as a corner 3pt shot in the NBA, which if he could hit the corner 3 consistently, shit that&rsquo;s worth something coming off the bench. But yeah, I&rsquo;m not actively watching EL games either so I have no idea what his mobility is like. I doubt he&rsquo;s become too great of a defender, but I&rsquo;d also hope he&rsquo;s matured away from the mindset he used to have when he said &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t get paid to play defense&rdquo;.</p>

I liked Jabari&rsquo;s game better, his offensive bag was deep and he was big, but injuries took it all away. I imagine he was just overcome with emotion whenever that reporter asked that which is understandable given everything that&rsquo;s happened to him. Barcelona is a really awesome city though and he&rsquo;s still pro hooping so his life is still at least 30x better than mine lol</p>
