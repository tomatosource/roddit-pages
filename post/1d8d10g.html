      <label for="l75vq3o" class="commentText"><p>I mean while I 100% believe everything he‚Äôs saying in this statement is true and he‚Äôs being totally honest about his feelings towards Barcelona and his experiences there, I‚Äôm still a bit skeptical that he‚Äôs being honest about his reaction in the original video being ‚Äútears of happiness‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>

<p>he looked absolutely devastated and destroyed in that video. Like I dunno, I‚Äôve seen people cry tears of joy many times, and none of them looked remotely like that</p>

<p>This seems like he‚Äôs just trying to save Barca a bit of face bc he probably feels badly that ppl were interpreting his reaction as ‚Äúdamn he probably feels horrible that he now has to deal with playing for some shitty team in Europe instead of the glamorous NBA! Look at how sad he is about how horrible his life turned out!‚Äù</p>

<p>and felt self conscious about ppl in Barcelona thinking that he wasn‚Äôt happy with his experience there and him thinking about being forced to be there literally brought him to tears and and that he‚Äôd rather be in America. And this is his way of saying ‚Äúno I‚Äôm actually very a grateful and happy to be here!‚Äù (Which I‚Äôm sure he is)</p>

<p>you&rsquo;ve never been going thru some bad shit in your life and your mom asks you how you&rsquo;re doing and you lie and say &ldquo;oh Im fine Ma, yeah everything is great!&rdquo; because you dont want her to worry or be negatively impacted by your feelings of sadness or anger or whatever?</p>

<p>literally everyone has done something like that at one point or another&hellip; Jabari lying about being sad in order to not hurt the feelings of those who he is grateful to in the Barca organization for helping get his career back on track is no different than that&hellip;</p>

<p>and like I already said, I dont even think he&rsquo;s lying about what he is saying in this clip. I think that&rsquo;s 100% true and from the heart (even tho he sounds like he has a gun to his head in this audio lol). I just dont think those were tears of happiness in the original video ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sue me.. you guys can simp for the PR statement if you want, doesnt bother me lol</p>

      <label for="l7634e7" class="commentText"><p>why is it a stretch? people tell little white lies about their true feelings every day, in order to protect the feelings of people we care about when we are worried our actions/words/feeling might be interpreted in a way we dont want them to be.</p>

<p>I do it, you do it, we all do it. its incredibly common human behavior.. why would it be a stretch to think that is what&rsquo;s happening here?</p>

<p>he has a lot of gratitude and warm feelings towards Barcelona, and doesnt want them to interpret his tears as a sign of ungratefulness or anger signaling that he&rsquo;s upset or unhappy that he&rsquo;s been reduced to playing in europe</p>

<p>you dont need to have a psychology degree to understand that when you see someone breaking down like they were just told they lost a parent, with a clenched jaw, furrowed brow, and 1000 yard stare, they probably arent experiencing intense amounts of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;</p>

<p>but my comment was getting a bit long, and I figured you guys would get my point. I guess not üôÑ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>barcelona fc is worth much more than most nba teams my dude</p>
</blockquote>

<p>very odd point to make, <em>my dude</em>, considering the soccer team accounts for 95% of that worth/income, and the basketball team doesnt really make very much money at all in the scheme of things.</p>

<p>barcelona&rsquo;s highest paid basketball player gets paid like 2 million dollars. how does that stack up to the highest paid player on the average nba team?? are you really sure you wanna keep arguing about this? lol</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barcelona&rdquo; as you are using the term, is a sporting club with over 20 sports teams so that seems like a weird comparison for you to make vs one NBA team&hellip;..</p>

<p>pretty sure if you made a big group of the Yankees, Knicks, Rangers, Giants, Red Bulls, Liberty, Gotham FC, Rutgers and St Johns, that &ldquo;club&rdquo; would be worth a lot more then most NBA teams (and most soccer teams) too, <em>my dude</em> ;)</p>

It&rsquo;s feasible to think something like that could have weighed on someone to the point of being depressed about it. It&rsquo;s good that he&rsquo;s keeping things in perspective instead of thinking that way.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo continue on this topic: Can you imagine how much of an ego hit it must be to have already washed out of the league and your old teammates/friends group chats are still blowing up with stories about their ongoing NBA experiences.

<p>Makes sense why many players describe their time overseas initially as feeling lonely or isolating. (Aside from being in a different country obviously)</p>

He still gets paid to play basketball but injuries have had a drastic effect compared to where he thought he was meant to go. I can&rsquo;t tell you for sure whether he&rsquo;s being genuine that his tears were only happy, but if you don&rsquo;t understand why he might feel bitter then you aren&rsquo;t thinking hard enough.</p>

Dude was definitely feeling the entirety of his journey.</p>

One could interpret it like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a total pleasure&rdquo; or the more often usage of &ldquo;dream&rdquo;, which interprets it like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a dream of mine&rdquo;, which is not factually true. Of course he didn&rsquo;t dream of playing for FCB, he dreamed of playing in the NBA.</p>

<p>The wording was a little strange for me in that one part.</p>

He also wasn&rsquo;t too bad at 3pt shooting at the end of his Milwaukee tenure, he had decent efficiency. He was a way better shooter than Exum was before this year. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna be a sharpshooter or anything, but he could probably be a decent spot up shooter if he put his efforts into it.</p>

<p>Now defensively, meh. Probably gonna get cooked.</p>

      <label for="l76f0jw" class="commentText"><p>It is a shorter 3pt line, but their line is about the same distance as a corner 3pt shot in the NBA, which if he could hit the corner 3 consistently, shit that&rsquo;s worth something coming off the bench. But yeah, I&rsquo;m not actively watching EL games either so I have no idea what his mobility is like. I doubt he&rsquo;s become too great of a defender, but I&rsquo;d also hope he&rsquo;s matured away from the mindset he used to have when he said &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t get paid to play defense&rdquo;.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure he is grateful, but I&rsquo;m also sure that he&rsquo;s upset life didn&rsquo;t take him where he thought it would. If so, hopefully he can just enjoy his life cause he still has it pretty amazing.</p>

      <label for="l75p62z" class="commentText"><p>I believe this to be a half truth most likely. I remember the hype between him and Wiggins was crazy. I liked Jabari&rsquo;s game better, his offensive bag was deep and he was big, but injuries took it all away. I imagine he was just overcome with emotion whenever that reporter asked that which is understandable given everything that&rsquo;s happened to him. Barcelona is a really awesome city though and he&rsquo;s still pro hooping so his life is still at least 30x better than mine lol</p>
