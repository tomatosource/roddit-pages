      <label for="lt8gkky" class="commentText"><p>Bulls to me finish 10th by default but pick protections could come into play&hellip;I just feel they&rsquo;ll end up with the Hornets just being too good to not finish 10th or perhaps 11th&hellip;too good compared to the rest of the bottom dwellers.</p>

<p>I think if Kawhi plays 55-60 games that the Clippers finish above .500.</p>

<p>Spurs are maybe the hardest team to predict outside of some of the injury risk teams because it really does bet and hinge on how much growth their young guys make and how much impact old Barnes and Paul make and that&rsquo;s volatile.</p>

They&rsquo;re just an easy to trash talk team, but they&rsquo;re still gonna produce wins.Thirty seven is way too low. Mid forties is way more like it. They&rsquo;re gonna be a really good pick and roll team. They have great rim protection and insane poa defense</p>

      <label for="lt8wt9b" class="commentText"><p>They also had to integrate Harden after the season had already started, and Zubac missed 14 disastrous games.</p>

<p>Dunn/KPJ is an upgrade over Westbrook. Bamba/Jones are upgrades over Theis/Plumlee. Batum is a massive upgrade over PJ Tucker. DJJ is a great addition, and there&rsquo;s legit upside in second year players Miller and Brown.</p>

<p>Paul George is a bigger loss than most Clippers fans are willing to admit, but  Powell can make up a chunk of his scoring, (and I think the hope is KPJ can make up Norm&rsquo;s bench scoring).</p>

<p>Without Kawhi, I think scoring could conservatively break down like:</p>

<p>Harden - 20 ppg</p>

<p>Norm - 17</p>

<p>KPJ - 15</p>

<p>Zubac - 14</p>

<p>Mann - 13</p>

<p>DJJ - 10</p>

<p>Dunn - 8</p>

<p>Coffey/Miller/Brown (all will be 9th/10th man) - 8</p>

<p>Bamba/Jones - 7</p>

<p>Batum - 6</p>

<p>If Kawhi comes back and can average between 20-24 points (even with some regression, he&rsquo;ll get more shots up this season with PG out of the picture) over 50-60 games.</p>

<p>If the Clippers win less than 42 games, it&rsquo;s because Kawhi, Harden, and Zubac all miss significant time, and the rest of the West is healthier than usual.</p>

      <label for="lt8k1zp" class="commentText"><p>Scoring is going to be interesting forsure. Clippers will have to be a much better rebounding team, and manufacture more transition points from the defensive end.</p>

<p>But they will not be a stinky defensive team like last season. Harden won&rsquo;t have to force feed an inconsistent PG13 for 27% of the shots every night too with the ball sticking and not moving from PGs hands.</p>

      <label for="lt8fvxb" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think people realize how bad the russ and g duo was in a lot of their losses and losing plumlee and not playing p j.Tucker anymore is going to result in more wins</p>

<p>Like pg&rsquo;s averages look great, but he was very inconsistent on offense, and he took hella, plays off on defense and never did any of the dirty work and would complain when he had to.  he would cost you games versus good teams and then look like a superstar against bad teams.</p>

<p>There were a lot of warts with last year&rsquo;s team that aren&rsquo;t there anymore and they have way more hustle, guys with athleticism, this year</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t have the same ceiling obviously for the playoffs, but their floor I think is higher. Better regular season, depth more. Buy in more established rolls. Less guys playing to not get hurt or thinking there too good to do certain things</p>

      <label for="lt8imbj" class="commentText"><p>It’s not just PG’s averages that look great, his impact stats were absolutely huge. He also directly brought several important skills they didn’t replace, such as being one of the teams only creators and being a high volume 3 point shooter on good efficiency and one of their only large wings that can effectively scale up defensively.</p>

<p>Now assuming Kawhi misses half the year which seems like a given, you have a post prime harden having to do 90% of the creation for a team full of scrappy but fairly raw and generally undersized athletes. Doesn’t seem like it compares out west to very many teams</p>

      <label for="lt8klq4" class="commentText"><p>PG had way more run with starters than Harden. They gave Harden shittier lineups to work with because they couldn&rsquo;t trust PG to run with anything other than the starters or Norm lol.</p>

<p>PG was not a good creator. His playmaking was ass, his turnovers were hilariously unforced, and he fouled a ton when asked to guard good players. His ISO PPP was barely cracking 1.0 while Harden and Kawhi were both over 1.15. PG was a great spot up shooter last year. That&rsquo;s the only thing he was elite at.</p>

<p>Harden was better than PG</p>

      <label for="lt8o3y7" class="commentText"><p>All 10 of Hardens most frequent lineups involved PG or Kawhi, 5 of them involved both, 8 of them involved at least 3 other starters playing with harden.</p>

<p>PG’s creation is miles and miles ahead of any non harden-kawhi player on the current roster. Losing that constrains the offensive versatility, ability to stifle minutes,  as well as insurance for injuries.</p>

<p>Whether harden was better than PG is not relevant since you lost PG outright, you didn’t swap him for harden. You had both.</p>

      <label for="lt8xmk1" class="commentText"><p>You are right about PG, but I am not sure why Kawhi missing the start of the season means it&rsquo;s a given that he&rsquo;ll miss half the year.</p>

<p>The only position at which Clippers are undersized is PF. Harden is big for his position, Powell and Mann are average, DJJ is a big short but with great length and vertical, and Zubac/Bamba are massive. KPJ, Dunn, Batum, Jones, and Coffey are all average to big for their positions.</p>

<p>Really tough team to forecast because of the Kawhi factor, and thus I don&rsquo;t think 37 is a terrible number.  If Kawhi doesn&rsquo;t play at all this year, for example, they may not even win 30 games.</p>

      <label for="lt8ugbm" class="commentText"><p>The Bulls were unusually clutch last season thanks to Demar DeRozan. He&rsquo;s gone now and won&rsquo;t be there to eek out those close wins. They have also lost Caruso/Drummond. That&rsquo;s <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> net positive players gone from last season. They&rsquo;ll be bad</p>

      <label for="lt8w40c" class="commentText"><p>This sub is notoriously bad with any real predictions, just default to last seasons narratives.</p>

<p>I remember last year arguing with someone who thought there would only be two 50-win teams in the west. And that the 1 seed would have 53 wins. This is because in 2023 the 1 seed Nuggets did in fact have 53 wins, but that was the lowest win total for a #1 seed since 2002. And second lowest in any season ever. Obviously that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen again.</p>
