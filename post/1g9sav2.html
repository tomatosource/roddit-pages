      <label for="lt8d0vc" class="commentText"><p>The clippers are definitely being underrated. They&rsquo;re just an easy to trash talk team, but they&rsquo;re still gonna produce wins.Thirty seven is way too low. Mid forties is way more like it. They&rsquo;re gonna be a really good pick and roll team. They have great rim protection and insane poa defense</p>

      <label for="lt8k1zp" class="commentText"><p>Scoring is going to be interesting forsure. Clippers will have to be a much better rebounding team, and manufacture more transition points from the defensive end.</p>

<p>But they will not be a stinky defensive team like last season. Harden won&rsquo;t have to force feed an inconsistent PG13 for 27% of the shots every night too with the ball sticking and not moving from PGs hands.</p>

      <label for="lt8fvxb" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think people realize how bad the russ and g duo was in a lot of their losses and losing plumlee and not playing p j.Tucker anymore is going to result in more wins</p>

<p>Like pg&rsquo;s averages look great, but he was very inconsistent on offense, and he took hella, plays off on defense and never did any of the dirty work and would complain when he had to.  he would cost you games versus good teams and then look like a superstar against bad teams.</p>

<p>There were a lot of warts with last year&rsquo;s team that aren&rsquo;t there anymore and they have way more hustle, guys with athleticism, this year</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t have the same ceiling obviously for the playoffs, but their floor I think is higher. Better regular season, depth more. Buy in more established rolls. Less guys playing to not get hurt or thinking there too good to do certain things</p>

      <label for="lt8imbj" class="commentText"><p>It’s not just PG’s averages that look great, his impact stats were absolutely huge. He also directly brought several important skills they didn’t replace, such as being one of the teams only creators and being a high volume 3 point shooter on good efficiency and one of their only large wings that can effectively scale up defensively.</p>

<p>Now assuming Kawhi misses half the year which seems like a given, you have a post prime harden having to do 90% of the creation for a team full of scrappy but fairly raw and generally undersized athletes. Doesn’t seem like it compares out west to very many teams</p>

      <label for="lt8klq4" class="commentText"><p>PG had way more run with starters than Harden. They gave Harden shittier lineups to work with because they couldn&rsquo;t trust PG to run with anything other than the starters or Norm lol.</p>

<p>PG was not a good creator. His playmaking was ass, his turnovers were hilariously unforced, and he fouled a ton when asked to guard good players. His ISO PPP was barely cracking 1.0 while Harden and Kawhi were both over 1.15. PG was a great spot up shooter last year. That&rsquo;s the only thing he was elite at.</p>

<p>Harden was better than PG</p>

      <label for="lt8e9mh" class="commentText"><p>I think 37 wins is baking in risk of Kawhi not playing half the season.  They&rsquo;ll smash 37 if they get another 70 games out of him, but that looks very doubtful this year.</p>

<p>Really tough team to forecast because of the Kawhi factor, and thus I don&rsquo;t think 37 is a terrible number.  If Kawhi doesn&rsquo;t play at all this year, for example, they may not even win 30 games.</p>

<p>I think if Kawhi plays 55-60 games that the Clippers finish above .500.</p>

<p>Spurs are maybe the hardest team to predict outside of some of the injury risk teams because it really does bet and hinge on how much growth their young guys make and how much impact old Barnes and Paul make and that&rsquo;s volatile.</p>
