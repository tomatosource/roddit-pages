      <label for="l7eq5ig" class="commentText"><p>EXACTLY. I&rsquo;m sure ARod/Lore have shared all the pertinent details with Bloomberg&rsquo;s lawyers, and there&rsquo;s no way Bloomberg would be cool putting this out there (since it doesn&rsquo;t gain him anything yet anyways) unless he was certain ARod/Lore would come out on top.</p>

<p>This goes back to what I&rsquo;ve been saying all along - Taylor&rsquo;s only real play here is to sow enough discord to try to get the league to disapprove, and the only argument he really has is &ldquo;they might not be rich enough.&rdquo; ARod/Lore know that public opinion (and opinions of the owners) matters, and this announcement should put that concern to bed.</p>

      <label for="l7erc6p" class="commentText"><p>Something I am sure the arbiter is taking into account is the precedent that could be set by ruling in Taylor&rsquo;s favor. Essentially, Taylor is arguing that Lore/Arod did not &ldquo;try hard enough&rdquo; (the legalese way of stating this is commercially reasonable efforts) to secure the funding. Lore and Arod did in fact submit the final paperwork and proof of funding ~1 week prior to the deadline. So, a ruling in Taylor&rsquo;s favor would set precedent that this whole process that Taylor himself set up is an invalid way to purchase an NBA franchise and that deadlines aren&rsquo;t actually deadlines.</p>

      <label for="l7fe65b" class="commentText"><p>Lore/Arod were late with their payment in 2023, Glen gave them more time to pay. They were late on their payment in 2024, and he cancelled the deal. Financial agreements like this are subject to all parties following the agreed upon terms. Glen is a complete self serving snake, but he&rsquo;s 100% allowed to cancel the contract because Lore/Arod failed to follow the terms of the sale. The fact that it already happened once and Taylor allowed them a grace period is why he&rsquo;s going to win. The arbiter is going to say he acted in good faith, and Lore/Arod did not.</p>

<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s in arbitration, so it should all come out in the wash.<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39768940/a-rod-marc-lore-lose-backing-deal-majority-stake-timberwolves" target="_blank"> But the NBA is on record saying Lore/Arod&rsquo;s claim that the league delayed the payment because they didn&rsquo;t OK the capital investment firm who was joining Lore/Arod was false</a>. The NBA didn&rsquo;t have any issue with the The Carlyle group, the Carlyle group pulled out for undisclosed reasons and Lore/Arod couldn&rsquo;t come up with the money on time (again). Lore/Arod have already been caught in a lie, and have failed to make payments on time. So that&rsquo;s at least 2 strikes against them.</p>

<p>Also, IIRC, the Rudy Gobert deal was also lobbied by Lore and Rodríguez. In the past, Taylor would have never signed off on acquiring such an expensive player.</p>

      <label for="l7eppy6" class="commentText"><p>There are a subset of fans that only listen to legacy media sources that are literally owned by Taylor, and have long memories of other teams leaving / Taylor being a savior to that end that make them loyal. But most of us recognize that he&rsquo;s not good at owning a team and believe that new owners will breathe new life into the franchise (they already have).</p>

      <label for="l7esq4c" class="commentText"><p>Taylor has unlimited money (probably more untethered money than Lore/A-Rod) but is one of the biggest buffoons in terms of making major decisions and is the biggest reason why the franchise shot itself in the ass and foot and mouth several times since KG was drafted.</p>

<p>That said, I am semi-concerned that Lore/ARod will be semi-hamstrung financially even with Bloomberg involved and that some of the early moves to spend big are more flashy &ldquo;new owner energy&rdquo; than sustainable commitment.</p>
