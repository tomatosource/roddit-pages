    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Caruso is a 30 year old guard that relies on his athleticism, giddy is a 21 year old raw prospect who had a really bad year compared to his previous season</p>

<p>Caruso is the better player right now but if giddey produces the same as he did in 2023 then id say the trade is even just based on pure talent.</p>

<p>Caruso also only has 1 year left on his contract, meaning he is a UFA in 2026 and EVERY team in the league will be wanting him as a role player, meaning his cost is going to shoot up and OKC will need to pay him</p>

<p>finally, the fact that the bulls didnt get a pick isnt really that big a deal, they still should have, but if OKC is contending for the next few years (which they will be) the pick would be in the late first round anyway.</p>

<p>I might just be stupid so feel free to roast me</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine Giddey being the best haul possible for a piece that valuable even if the Bulls themselves don&rsquo;t see a use for him</p>

<p>Also just not getting any picks for a rebuilding team when you&rsquo;re making a trade with a team that has like 500 picks is kind of funny</p>

<p>This, IMO. The Bulls are obsessed with tall/long guards and our only &ldquo;true&rdquo; PG is Lonzo Ball who posted a dunking clip on insta within the last 2 years. And what bulls fans have forgotten is that even when he was healthy, he was a full court PG and resorted to catch and shoot 3&rsquo;s in the half court. Another tall PG with hopes of passing (and lack of shooting) is right up Billy D/AK&rsquo;s alley.</p>

His ability to play floor general, hit the 3 at a really respectable rate, and defend at a high level made him such a complete player.

      <label for="l9ksz86" class="commentText"><p>He was absolutely not a floor general. Derozan and Lavine took turns playing halfcourt PG when he was in. He was a Marcus Smart or this years Jrue type player who could also do the Ben Simmons and find shooters on a fast break. But yes, he was very good in that role and him and Caruso were a terrifying defensive backcourt.</p>

      <label for="l9latie" class="commentText"><p>But still it&rsquo;s their job to play hardball and try to get the best return possible. Even if they desperately love Giddey and think he&rsquo;s got all-nba upside. Its only June! The season literally just ended and the team your dealing with controls an outsized portion of picks going forward.  It&rsquo;s baffling tbh, this should be a leverage trade for you guys I can&rsquo;t make sense of it, I feel like if anything could there have been some secret Caruso sauce telling them I only want OKC but even then it still doesn&rsquo;t make sense because of how early this is, you just don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t roll over like that.</p>

<p>And I get the point of the original post value wise you can argue Giddey is competitive with Caruso esp long term.  But this isn&rsquo;t about pure value its about negotiating power and its super confusing how this trade played out like OKC had upper hand.</p>

<p>With the report that we&rsquo;ve floated 15 varying offers to Sixers and the Jazz for Lavine, I think our FO just talks too much. Like a rigid, needy ex or something that forgot shutting the fuck up sometimes yields better results. It makes it easy for opposing GMs to handle things on their terms, and I think that&rsquo;s what happened here.</p>

<p>Unless we are talking about a pick that can realistically turn into a top5 or max Top10 pick, getting a player like giddy is the best thing you can hope for when using said pick.</p>

<p>So, why not get the prospect directly, knowing pretty well what he is capable of after several years in the league, instead of taking the risk.</p>

I think you guys have <em>7</em> picks next year, 5 FRPs and 2 seconds. OKC can&rsquo;t use all 7 in the draft, so some of them have to be dealt. A smarter FO should have been able to at least poach 1 or 2 of the second round picks you guys have over the next 5 drafts. Hell, Hayward netted young players and 2 seconds.

Still can&rsquo;t shoot, can&rsquo;t drive to the basket, can&rsquo;t break down a defender, and is a bad defender. He&rsquo;s a player that needs the ball in his hand because he&rsquo;s a good passer with good vision but he&rsquo;s not a real playmaker because he can&rsquo;t create openings with his offence. He&rsquo;s simply not a good player lmao.</p>

      <label for="l9kumux" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m buying stock in Giddey and I&rsquo;ll tell you why&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Kobe Bryant averaged 30 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 2.2 steals with 45%/38% shooting in 2002-03.</strong></p>

<p>He then allegedly raped someone.  The fallout from that alleged rape caused quite the distraction in the 2003-04 season.  The criminal trial was eventually dropped when the victim refused to testify contingent on Kobe admitting that he now understood she didn&rsquo;t see the encounter as consensual and that the civil suit would proceed.</p>

<p>Said Kobe in his statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year… I also want to make it clear that I do not question the motives of this young woman. No money has been paid to this woman… I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter… I issue this statement today fully aware that while one part of this case ends today, another remains. I understand that the civil case against me will go forward.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surprising amount of people seem to be confused about the difference between criminal trials (potential prison) and civil trials (monetary damages). The civil trial was eventually dropped when Kobe settled out of court for millions.</p>

<p><strong>But let&rsquo;s take a look at Kobe&rsquo;s production during the rape season:</strong></p>

<p>24 points (20% decrease), 5.5 rebounds (20.2% decrease), 5.1 assists (13.5% decrease), 1.7 steals (22.7% decrease), 43.8%/32.7% (14% decrease)</p>

<p>He was also dreadful in the playoffs shooting 41% from the field and 24% from three, singlehandedly shooting the Lakers out of the Finals with 38% shooting from the field and 17% from three.</p>

<p>What does this tell us about Josh Giddey?</p>

<p>Giddey allegedly statutory raped a 15-16 year old girl he allegedly had a relationship with.  It was widely reported that the family had hired Gloria Allred - one of the biggest names in civil litigation.  Police investigated, but the girl and the family was unwilling to cooperate.  Nothing else was reported about the Gloria Allred hire.  Basic common sense/wild speculation would suggest a civil suit was in play but Josh was able to avoid further public embarrassment and a public trial keeping him out of the season/playoffs the good ol settlement route.</p>

<p><strong>Giddey&rsquo;s performance 2022-23:</strong>  16.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 48% shooting</p>

<p><strong>Giddey&rsquo;s rape season in 2024:</strong>  12.3 points (25.9% decrease), 6.4 rebounds (18.9% decrease), 4.8 assists (22.5% decrease), 47.5% shooting</p>

<p>Like Kobe, Giddey was also dreadful in the playoffs during his rape season shooting a miserable Kobe-rape-season-esque 43.2% FG and 18.8%  3p% in their eliminated series.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re following along, based on the sample size of Kobe and Giddey, we can objectively say that NBA players with rape allegations hovering over their season will see a 20% decrease in statistical output across the board.</p>

<p>Ironically, Kobe at one point post-rape requested a trade and nearly was traded to, of all teams, the Chicago Bulls.  Apparently the Bulls are pretty receptive to alleged sexual offenders.  That trade never ended up happening, but in a post-rape Lakers world, Kobe did eventually rebound and have some of his greatest statistic seasons ever.  Let&rsquo;s jump forward 2 seasons post-rape and highlight his 2005-06 season for a 45 win Laker squad.  In that season, Kobe averaged a career high 35.4 points per game on 45% shooting.</p>

<p>35.4 points = 18% increase from Kobe&rsquo;s 2002-03 season</p>

<p>35.4 points = 47.5% increase from Kobe&rsquo;s rape season</p>

<p>Lets say GIddey sees a similar 18% pre-rape season or 47.5% rape season bump in his stats.  He&rsquo;d average the following:</p>

<p><strong>18% increase on GIddey&rsquo;s pre-rape season stats:</strong>  19.59 points, 9.3 rebounds, 7.3 assists</p>

<p><strong>47.5% increase on Giddey&rsquo;s rape season stats:</strong>  18.1 points, 9.4 rebounds, 7.1 assists</p>

<p>Ya&rsquo;ll aint ready for post rape allegation Giddey.</p>

<p>Bulls are blowing it up and have no need for Caruso. He’s a very good role player but he’s not returning a star’s haul in a trade. Giddey, for all his warts, is a talented young prospect. He’s only 21 - he’ll develop immensely and almost surely turn out better than Caruso.</p>

      <label for="l9kxpsm" class="commentText"><p>Agree. Giddey is a 21yo primary ball-handler and OKC had him playing off-ball and standing in the corner watching SGA and his massive usage rate.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t many 30yo primary ball-handlers who can make that adjustment without some pain. Giddey was trying to do it all with a massive negative off-court spotlight on him, as well.</p>

<p>I fully expect the Thunder will be better with Caruso next season.</p>

<p>I also fully expect in years to come OKC will have some &ldquo;Dang. Could&rsquo;ve used this version of Giddey.&rdquo; moments. There is a long list of talented players who develop a respectable jumpshot as they approach their mid-20s.</p>

<p>I mean there had to have been better trade offers with picks included , was Giddey really the best option?</p>

<p>DeMar’s probably gone , so there’s a huge hole for scoring , maybe this move would entail more movement as opposed to the heliocentrism offense</p>

This is the most normal trade I’ve seen and people are acting like it was a LeBron for Michael Carter Williams or something. It’s a great trade. NBA fans just like to hate on shit.</p>

<p>The problem is the value. The Bulls could have gotten way more at the deadline but their moronic owner decided to pretend they are a contender. They likely could have gotten way more now as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is INSANELY valuable to every single team in the league trying to win. You would be hard pressed to find a role player more valuable to a contender than Caruso when you factor in that contract. All this makes him an A+ addition for any GM in the league.</p>

<p>Yet the best they could do is a one of the worst shooting guards in the NBA who is unathletic? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think Giddey can be a solid player IF he can fix his shooting but damn&hellip;</p>

<p>Giddey is going to be 22 while Caruso is about to turn 31 this season. Caruso is a great defender, but he can&rsquo;t even start on the mediocre bulls. He&rsquo;s injury prone and not great offensively. Giddey isn&rsquo;t good on defense, and he regressed as a shooter, but he&rsquo;s a high upside swing, great size, good Play maker, and you think he can get his shot back to something more league average.</p>

<p>I like this trade more for Chicago than OKC, because I don&rsquo;t think wing defense was OKCs flaw.</p>

      <label for="l9ltj5f" class="commentText"><p>Right. They already have SGA and Dort who are this kind of player, but better in all other areas. And they have Cason, who I think will break out this year and push Caruso further back in terms of need.</p>

<p>They need size in the middle. They need rebounding. This didn&rsquo;t help that.</p>

The idea that the Thunder should have included first-round picks in the trade is crazy to me. The Bulls need to rebuild around young guys and don&rsquo;t need a 30-year-old stopper.</p>

      <label for="l9kpvhb" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a few things behind the trade itself as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is a win now player, so trading him away means the Bulls are no longer trying to win now, which is fine.</p>

<p>But they are repeating mistakes of the past in trading proven players for unproven ones and hoping they pan out.</p>

<p>Caruso for Giddey indicated ownership is still hoping to have their cake and eat it too. They want to rebuild the lineup without ever being really bad.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see similar young players coming back for Lavine or Ball or Vuc instead of picks.</p>

<p>Which means we are going to be bad but not bad enough to get a crack at a franchise caliber talent in the draft, limp into the play in tournament and rebuild again in 6 or 7 years.</p>

<p>Giddey is a young prospect with high upside if he can find his shot again.</p>

<p>Caruso immediately makes OKC better and removes OKC’s biggest weakness which was hiding Giddey on D (bad fit).</p>

<p>I think everyone’s overreacting about a first round pick that would have likely been late anyway.</p>

<p>I can only surmise that Giddey was viewed by the Bulls office as being a better fit than Caruso.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Caruso is a bad player, but might be a case of &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not what the Bulls need as compared to someone like Giddey.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I could see Giddey being out of the league within 3 years or this being a mini Harden for K-Mart disaster. </p>

<p> I am cautiously optimistic but I do really think this trade could blow up for us in a bad way. Giddeys value is at an all time low but he is extremely talented. </p>

<p> Would not surprise me one bit to see this being in one of those &ldquo;six years ago, here&rsquo;s what people thought of the Giddey trade&rdquo; type posts, posted by a sixers flair. </p>

Does he show flashes of brilliance from time to time, yea. But it’s few and far between. But when he’s bad he’s really bad. Left undefended by most teams due to being an abysmal shooter at all spots on the floor, and he will get hunted on defense for switches because he’s a traffic cone defensively. He’ll get you a handful of triple doubles every year if he’s the primary ball handler, but Chicago fans have every right to feel like they got a bad deal here. Giddey would be a great pick up in a different era of traditional point guards, but that era is long gone. The best he can be is a poor man’s Ricky Rubio</p>

      <label for="l9l1t6w" class="commentText"><p>Between this year and last year, Caruso&rsquo;s trade value has been through the roof. Virtually every team that&rsquo;s trying to win playoff games would call for him. Value was nuts coming off an all defense 1st team with 2 years on his deal. Spent the first half of this season showing he was still on that level. We decline to trade him at any point over the last 2 seasons for the sake of &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; (a slur on the bulls subreddit rn). This did nothing except lower his value. Instead of trading one of the best defensive guards with 2 years on his deal, or 1 and a half years on his deal, he&rsquo;s now an expiring contract. No matter how good you are, your value goes down if you&rsquo;re an expiring deal.</p>

<p>The main hurt of this trade is what we COULD have gotten. We passed up on what was likely plenty of great trades so that we could fight for the 9th seed. This FO has done nothing except preach continuity when everyone and their grandma could see that this team badly needs a rebuild. We sold Caruso lower than we could have. We will lose Drummond for nothing, we are going to trade Zach for nothing, we are going to overpay DeRozan and will be again looking to try to offload another bad contract. We have PWill to pay, and pretty soon, will have Giddey to pay. And then, after all that, we will be the 10th seed.</p>

Everyone thought the bulls would get a young player with potential and a draft pick. Rather people like it or not Josh giddey was probably easily the best young player they were going to get in a Caruso trade. Not getting draft picks does hurt this trade but name me a contending team that was going to give you a better Young player than giddey. If you are in the bulls situation why not trade the 30 year old player on the last year of his deal for a 21 year old who has played well in the league at times and has never been allowed to play to his strengths. I know the cool thing to say is giddey sucks but the same fans on Reddit and other social media forms have got it wrong plenty of times on players. There are countless examples in the last few years of NBA fans exploding on social media talking about how bad a player is or how a team over paid for this player and that player goes on to have a good career.</p>

Sure they could&rsquo;ve probably won a couple 2nd round picks if they held on Caruso for a bit longer but overall trading Caruso for Giddey, who is still only 21 and has shown great potential as ball handler, is a solid outcome. I can see a Giddey/White backcourt being fun to watch even though the defense might be ass.</p>

<p>Also Josh Giddey was just essentially unplayable in a playoff series. I&rsquo;m sure his numbers will go up and he will be a hell of a representative for the bulls at next years draft lottery, they will give him a fairly sizable contract and be stuck exactly where they are. Contending for the last spot in the play in with no real chance to improve until Vucevic and Lavine&rsquo;s contracts expire and they can start over.</p>

      <label for="l9ltgl8" class="commentText"><p>Tbh I like it a lot less for OKC than the consensus. Don’t get me wrong, I fully understand why they did it from financial and <em>win now</em> perspectives, but Giddy has legit potential. More than that, OKC’s two biggest weaknesses were a lack of size/rebounding and playmakers behind SGA… from my POV it just seems like they set themselves even further back in those two areas when everyone was saying they need to spend the offseason improving them.</p>

<p>Like I said, I still like and understand the trade for them… <strong><em>because</em></strong> it’s a long offseason and they still have plenty of time to reshape their team a bit. If they’re running it back with this being the only difference, idk how much better it makes them as a team even if Caruso is individually better than Giddy.</p>

<p>People are acting like the Bulls traded god damn Michael Jordan or Prime Derrick Rose.</p>

<p>They are a team that sucks and should be collecting young talent. Having 30+ role players is completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>AND there&rsquo;s the contract situation. On both ends. He doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of money (by NBA standards,) so he wasn&rsquo;t ever going to get a top player back in return. Could not have been a salary dump situation. Plus, he&rsquo;s going into the last year of his deal. Some team is going to be dumb enough to pay him $20m/year, so you know he&rsquo;s a one-year rental.</p>

<p>finally, the fact that the bulls didnt get a pick isnt really that big a deal, they still should have, but if OKC is contending for the next few years (which they will be) the pick would be in the late first round anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OKC literally owns picks from half the league. If the Bulls didn&rsquo;t value OKC&rsquo;s own FRPs they could have pushed for at least one FRP from their stash of Rockets, Heat, 76ers, Jazz, Nuggets, Clippers, and Mavericks picks.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve also got second round picks from some of those teams plus the Hawks, Warriors, Celtics, Grizzlies, Timberwolves, Bucks, and Suns.</p>

<p>On paper sure, they needed to flip Caruso and Giddey could be redeemed and give them a reset, but the fact is that the Bulls had the leverage and got swindled by not getting more back.</p>

      <label for="l9lvgtj" class="commentText"><p>The Thunder have an abundance of picks and Giddey’s value is at an all time low. Even if you believe in his potential, the Bulls definitely should have gotten more for taking on what is essentially a distressed asset right now.</p>

      <label for="l9lvj45" class="commentText"><p>They gave up a coveted 3 and D guy for a guy who can’t shoot. Not really sure how they see him fitting in with DeRozan and White. Maybe they’re thinking he’s Lonzo Ball part two?</p>

<p>Something I haven’t seen being talked about: OKC got torched by Dallas because they couldn’t rebound against them and they just gave up their second best rebounder.</p>

      <label for="l9lvtlp" class="commentText"><p>I really like this trade for both teams.  Giddey is good.  He&rsquo;ll have more freedom in the offense that he didn&rsquo;t have with SGA.  You could argue they should&rsquo;ve gotten a pick but they got a nice player</p>

      <label for="l9lxi0f" class="commentText"><p>It’s not a horrible trade I guess depends how you value giddey. Still they could’ve gotten more I think for caruso. He’s a good defensive guard on a 10 mill expiring. Chicago has a lot of guards. Is giddey a good fit for them? </p>

<p>A kinda ball dominant guard who isn’t much of a shooter or great off ball. And I know the bulls don’t wanna act like a rebuilding team but that’s what they are, weird to not get any first round picks back in this trade </p>

      <label for="l9lxify" class="commentText"><p>I think its actually a pretty great trade for the bulls… finally puts them in a direction to rebuild. I dont think Caruso is actually as valuable as people are pretending he is either. Giddey fits the mold of a player who they know worked exceptionally well for them in Lonzo, and he also has plenty of upside with him being so young. Im not sure what better trades there would be out there, maybe they could get a first but probably not a great first. Jrue Holiday was just traded for basically nothing and hes a way better version of Caruso. Teams arent willing to spend big on old role playing guards</p>

      <label for="l9m1euy" class="commentText"><p>The trade on its face is not that bad.</p>

<p>What matters is the <em>context</em>. Everyone and their mother knew OKC would not be keeping Giddey and there had been very little hype about anyone else wanting to take him. Whereas everyone and their mother knew that certain teams <em>desperately wanted</em> Caruso and were willing to give up a lot more to get him.</p>

<p>For the Bulls to not be able to turn that into <em>at least</em> a few additional picks from OKC, who has like fucking 30 of them, is just awful. Just awful, awful front office management</p>
