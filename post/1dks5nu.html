      <p>Caruso is a 30 year old guard that relies on his athleticism, giddy is a 21 year old raw prospect who had a really bad year compared to his previous season</p>

<p>Caruso is the better player right now but if giddey produces the same as he did in 2023 then id say the trade is even just based on pure talent.</p>

<p>Caruso also only has 1 year left on his contract, meaning he is a UFA in 2026 and EVERY team in the league will be wanting him as a role player, meaning his cost is going to shoot up and OKC will need to pay him</p>

<p>finally, the fact that the bulls didnt get a pick isnt really that big a deal, they still should have, but if OKC is contending for the next few years (which they will be) the pick would be in the late first round anyway.</p>

<p>I might just be stupid so feel free to roast me</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine Giddey being the best haul possible for a piece that valuable even if the Bulls themselves don&rsquo;t see a use for him</p>

<p>Also just not getting any picks for a rebuilding team when you&rsquo;re making a trade with a team that has like 500 picks is kind of funny</p>

<p>This, IMO. The Bulls are obsessed with tall/long guards and our only &ldquo;true&rdquo; PG is Lonzo Ball who posted a dunking clip on insta within the last 2 years. And what bulls fans have forgotten is that even when he was healthy, he was a full court PG and resorted to catch and shoot 3&rsquo;s in the half court. Another tall PG with hopes of passing (and lack of shooting) is right up Billy D/AK&rsquo;s alley.</p>

He was a Marcus Smart or this years Jrue type player who could also do the Ben Simmons and find shooters on a fast break.

It’s fine to say it’s a shit trade because the Bulls need to blow it all the way up and this isn’t helping their cause but they clearly don’t want to do that. They want to continue fighting for play-in spots in perpetuity. Picks don’t help them do that.</p>

<p>To me, a shit trade is one in which a team has a goal in mind, and is likely to fail to achieve it as a result of the trade. That’s not the case here. We can talk shit about how stupid the Bulls’ goals are all day but this trade helps them get where they want to go more than anything another contender could offer them.</p>

<p>OKC don’t need to do a damn thing about their picks, it’s super easy to trade them on draft night (or earlier) for picks in following years. You think they can’t just trade the 12th pick this year for Cleveland’s 2025 first or something? Two seconds this year for a shit team’s 2026 second? They haven’t shown any willingness to move any of their picks to date, it’s not like it’s some free-for-all Chicago missed out on.</p>

They already proved he doesn&rsquo;t fit the team in the playoffs and they probably have to move or replace him.  Bulls could easily just run things back with Caruso, it&rsquo;s not like swapping him for Giddey does much for them.

OG, Batum, Bruce Brown, KCP, Gary Harris, Melton, GP2, Gary Trent and Klay are all available. And that’s just the 2/3’s. There are also multiple 3/4s available if they were willing to move Dort or JDub up a spot to the 2 or 3. Both of these teams are notoriously stingy at this point and neither of them actually needed to do anything.</p>

      <label for="l9kk75b" class="commentText"><p>Having to move somebody (which I agree, OKC clearly did) doesn’t have any bearing on a player’s value if there are multiple suitors. Look at when the Jazz blew the Gobert/Mitchell core up, for example. As for potential destinations for Giddey, there are a few.</p>

<p>San Antonio comes to mind as a team in desperate need of somebody who can pass the ball properly, and Giddey matches their timeline much better than their other potential options even if he is also worse than some of them. They’ve got a few good-not-great players to spare, and a boatload of picks. Depending on what Utah wants to do I could see them being interested. They also have some interesting role players, and of course Lauri is OKC’s big fish if you wanted to turn it into a seriously big package. The Warriors could try to continue some “two timelines” nonsense if Klay leaves and slot Giddey in next to Steph as another guy to set him up. The Heat could look to heavily retool if Jimmy goes, Giddey gives them somewhat of a starting point for that.</p>

<p>That’s not to say any of these are <em>good</em> options for those teams, but they are realistic to varying degrees (Heat and Warriors less so, SA and Utah very realistic). There’s a market for a guy like Giddey, even off a bad year.</p>

      <label for="l9kumux" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m buying stock in Giddey and I&rsquo;ll tell you why&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Kobe Bryant averaged 30 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 2.2 steals with 45%/38% shooting in 2002-03.</strong></p>

<p>He then allegedly raped someone.  The fallout from that alleged rape caused quite the distraction in the 2003-04 season.  The criminal trial was eventually dropped when the victim refused to testify contingent on Kobe admitting that he now understood she didn&rsquo;t see the encounter as consensual and that the civil suit would proceed.</p>

<p>Said Kobe in his statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year… I also want to make it clear that I do not question the motives of this young woman. No money has been paid to this woman… I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter… I issue this statement today fully aware that while one part of this case ends today, another remains. I understand that the civil case against me will go forward.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surprising amount of people seem to be confused about the difference between criminal trials (potential prison) and civil trials (monetary damages). The civil trial was eventually dropped when Kobe settled out of court for millions.</p>

<p><strong>But let&rsquo;s take a look at Kobe&rsquo;s production during the rape season:</strong></p>

<p>24 points (20% decrease), 5.5 rebounds (20.2% decrease), 5.1 assists (13.5% decrease), 1.7 steals (22.7% decrease), 43.8%/32.7% (14% decrease)</p>

<p>He was also dreadful in the playoffs shooting 41% from the field and 24% from three, singlehandedly shooting the Lakers out of the Finals with 38% shooting from the field and 17% from three.</p>

<p>What does this tell us about Josh Giddey?</p>

<p>Giddey allegedly statutory raped a 15-16 year old girl he allegedly had a relationship with.  It was widely reported that the family had hired Gloria Allred - one of the biggest names in civil litigation.  Police investigated, but the girl and the family was unwilling to cooperate.  Nothing else was reported about the Gloria Allred hire.  Basic common sense/wild speculation would suggest a civil suit was in play but Josh was able to avoid further public embarrassment and a public trial keeping him out of the season/playoffs the good ol settlement route.</p>

<p><strong>Giddey&rsquo;s performance 2022-23:</strong>  16.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 48% shooting</p>

<p><strong>Giddey&rsquo;s rape season in 2024:</strong>  12.3 points (25.9% decrease), 6.4 rebounds (18.9% decrease), 4.8 assists (22.5% decrease), 47.5% shooting</p>

<p>Like Kobe, Giddey was also dreadful in the playoffs during his rape season shooting a miserable Kobe-rape-season-esque 43.2% FG and 18.8%  3p% in their eliminated series.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re following along, based on the sample size of Kobe and Giddey, we can objectively say that NBA players with rape allegations hovering over their season will see a 20% decrease in statistical output across the board.</p>

<p>Ironically, Kobe at one point post-rape requested a trade and nearly was traded to, of all teams, the Chicago Bulls.  Apparently the Bulls are pretty receptive to alleged sexual offenders.  That trade never ended up happening, but in a post-rape Lakers world, Kobe did eventually rebound and have some of his greatest statistic seasons ever.  Let&rsquo;s jump forward 2 seasons post-rape and highlight his 2005-06 season for a 45 win Laker squad.  In that season, Kobe averaged a career high 35.4 points per game on 45% shooting.</p>

<p>35.4 points = 18% increase from Kobe&rsquo;s 2002-03 season</p>

<p>35.4 points = 47.5% increase from Kobe&rsquo;s rape season</p>

<p>Lets say GIddey sees a similar 18% pre-rape season or 47.5% rape season bump in his stats.  He&rsquo;d average the following:</p>

<p><strong>18% increase on GIddey&rsquo;s pre-rape season stats:</strong>  19.59 points, 9.3 rebounds, 7.3 assists</p>

<p><strong>47.5% increase on Giddey&rsquo;s rape season stats:</strong>  18.1 points, 9.4 rebounds, 7.1 assists</p>

<p>Ya&rsquo;ll aint ready for post rape allegation Giddey.</p>

<p>Bulls are blowing it up and have no need for Caruso. He’s a very good role player but he’s not returning a star’s haul in a trade. Giddey, for all his warts, is a talented young prospect. He’s only 21 - he’ll develop immensely and almost surely turn out better than Caruso.</p>

<p>I mean there had to have been better trade offers with picks included , was Giddey really the best option?</p>

<p>DeMar’s probably gone , so there’s a huge hole for scoring , maybe this move would entail more movement as opposed to the heliocentrism offense</p>

<p>The problem is the value. The Bulls could have gotten way more at the deadline but their moronic owner decided to pretend they are a contender. They likely could have gotten way more now as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is INSANELY valuable to every single team in the league trying to win. You would be hard pressed to find a role player more valuable to a contender than Caruso when you factor in that contract. All this makes him an A+ addition for any GM in the league.</p>

<p>Yet the best they could do is a one of the worst shooting guards in the NBA who is unathletic? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think Giddey can be a solid player IF he can fix his shooting but damn&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l9k97rb" class="commentText"><p>It’s a great even trade completely about fit. Caruso will mesh perfectly with the Thunder as a win now piece. Giddey will probably get the ball back in his hands on the Bulls and continue his rise and development. This is the most normal trade I’ve seen and people are acting like it was a LeBron for Michael Carter Williams or something. It’s a great trade. NBA fans just like to hate on shit.</p>

<p>Have nothing against Josh personally, but he really was a horrible player for us. Man can&rsquo;t shoot, loves his floaters but aren&rsquo;t effective at it, when he&rsquo;s focused he&rsquo;s an average defender at best.</p>

<p>Man&rsquo;s only redeeming quality for me was his stationary passing, he likes his out of bounds plays for sure. He can also see cuts when he stops his dribble. Other than that, good riddance really.</p>

<p>He will go on a good streak during the season at times which will make fans go &ldquo;oh?&rdquo; and then the regression to the mean hits soon thereafter.</p>

      <label for="l9k5z3o" class="commentText"><p>100% agree.</p>

<p>Giddey is going to be 22 while Caruso is about to turn 31 this season. Caruso is a great defender, but he can&rsquo;t even start on the mediocre bulls. He&rsquo;s injury prone and not great offensively. Giddey isn&rsquo;t good on defense, and he regressed as a shooter, but he&rsquo;s a high upside swing, great size, good Play maker, and you think he can get his shot back to something more league average.</p>

<p>I like this trade more for Chicago than OKC, because I don&rsquo;t think wing defense was OKCs flaw.</p>

<p>maybe some better gm could&rsquo;ve gotten more for caruso if he was traded before with a desperate almost contender, but as it is now it is fine. giddey is on average better than most top 10 picks in most drafts, and this one is not a particularly promising draft anyways.</p>

Giddey&rsquo;s ceiling is much higher than that. Yes you&rsquo;ve got the sure thing in Caruso vs the prospect in Giddey but there&rsquo;s really not much of a risk there unless he does a Ben Simmons and goes mental.</p>

      <label for="l9k83ti" class="commentText"><p>I guarantee in 10 years time we’re going to come back to this thread and see that this trade was a win for both teams.</p>

<p>Giddey is a young prospect with high upside if he can find his shot again.</p>

<p>Caruso immediately makes OKC better and removes OKC’s biggest weakness which was hiding Giddey on D (bad fit).</p>

<p>I think everyone’s overreacting about a first round pick that would have likely been late anyway.</p>

<p>Everyone overvalues picks.</p>

      <label for="l9kvj1j" class="commentText"><p>He’s legitimately one of the top 5-7 wing defenders in the league and he can hit open 3s and is great at keeping the ball moving. Probably the best 5th starter/1st guy off the bench in the league. If Iggy was a 10 in that role Caruso is probably a 9. So he’s not mediocre, but he shouldn’t have gotten much more of a return which is why the Bulls didn’t get it despite them trying to strong arm more from teams for the past 6-7 months.</p>

      <label for="l9kj3ph" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s cause they traded without getting a pick for a valuable asset that a lot of teams wanted. Last season, the bulls were offered a 1st round pick for him, but they didn&rsquo;t want it, and you&rsquo;re saying caruso is old while giddey is young and can develop but his basically ben simmons with pedo allegations</p>

<p>And for the bulls who refuse to rebuild and always say they are trying to win now, why would they trade a young piece, hoping he will develop and trade away a win now player so i really looks like they don&rsquo;t know what they are doing thats my opinion tho.</p>

      <label for="l9kpvhb" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a few things behind the trade itself as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is a win now player, so trading him away means the Bulls are no longer trying to win now, which is fine.</p>

<p>But they are repeating mistakes of the past in trading proven players for unproven ones and hoping they pan out.</p>

<p>Caruso for Giddey indicated ownership is still hoping to have their cake and eat it too. They want to rebuild the lineup without ever being really bad.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see similar young players coming back for Lavine or Ball or Vuc instead of picks.</p>

<p>Which means we are going to be bad but not bad enough to get a crack at a franchise caliber talent in the draft, limp into the play in tournament and rebuild again in 6 or 7 years.</p>

<p>Turns out they had only 1 FRP offered. And it was in the weak 2024 draft. So now, it makes sense to trade for Giddey, as they know what to expect.</p>

<p>OKC just got an incredible starter/role player for cheap, though. It&rsquo;s like the Celtics trading for Jrue Holiday last year.</p>

      <label for="l9kcdkg" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not that this makes the teams worse (including potential). It&rsquo;s that their perceived value isn&rsquo;t the same. AC&rsquo;s a high value player even with his expiring contract, because he&rsquo;s an in demand role player. Giddey&rsquo;s a raw prospect with decent upside and a down year. Imo their trade value isn&rsquo;t the same. The bulls are gonna be fine, but surely they could&rsquo;ve gotten more out of this.</p>

<p>Caruso also only has 1 year left on his contract, meaning he is a UFA in 2026 and EVERY team in the league will be wanting him as a role player</p>

<p>Yup, it&rsquo;s very hard to get value out of players with 1 year left on their contract.</p>

<p>Could have done better than Giddey though.</p>

      <label for="l9kag3y" class="commentText"><p>There is absolutely no way that the best offer available for Caruso was Giddey. The reported GSW trade of Moses Moody + a pick is way more valueable bc GS is about to really suck in a few years. I get they didnt want any picks this draft because its considered a weak class but still.</p>

<p>In my oppinion its even worse because Giddey is an on ball playmaker and so you have to take away ball handling minutes from Coby White or Ayo Dosumu both players who IMO have much higher ceilings, so youre stifling the development of your own players.</p>
