    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Caruso is a 30 year old guard that relies on his athleticism, giddy is a 21 year old raw prospect who had a really bad year compared to his previous season</p>

<p>Caruso is the better player right now but if giddey produces the same as he did in 2023 then id say the trade is even just based on pure talent.</p>

<p>Caruso also only has 1 year left on his contract, meaning he is a UFA in 2026 and EVERY team in the league will be wanting him as a role player, meaning his cost is going to shoot up and OKC will need to pay him</p>

<p>finally, the fact that the bulls didnt get a pick isnt really that big a deal, they still should have, but if OKC is contending for the next few years (which they will be) the pick would be in the late first round anyway.</p>

<p>I might just be stupid so feel free to roast me</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine Giddey being the best haul possible for a piece that valuable even if the Bulls themselves don&rsquo;t see a use for him</p>

<p>Also just not getting any picks for a rebuilding team when you&rsquo;re making a trade with a team that has like 500 picks is kind of funny</p>

<p>This, IMO. The Bulls are obsessed with tall/long guards and our only &ldquo;true&rdquo; PG is Lonzo Ball who posted a dunking clip on insta within the last 2 years. And what bulls fans have forgotten is that even when he was healthy, he was a full court PG and resorted to catch and shoot 3&rsquo;s in the half court. Another tall PG with hopes of passing (and lack of shooting) is right up Billy D/AK&rsquo;s alley.</p>

His ability to play floor general, hit the 3 at a really respectable rate, and defend at a high level made him such a complete player.

      <label for="l9ksz86" class="commentText"><p>He was absolutely not a floor general. Derozan and Lavine took turns playing halfcourt PG when he was in. He was a Marcus Smart or this years Jrue type player who could also do the Ben Simmons and find shooters on a fast break. But yes, he was very good in that role and him and Caruso were a terrifying defensive backcourt.</p>

      <label for="l9latie" class="commentText"><p>But still it&rsquo;s their job to play hardball and try to get the best return possible. Even if they desperately love Giddey and think he&rsquo;s got all-nba upside. Its only June! The season literally just ended and the team your dealing with controls an outsized portion of picks going forward.  It&rsquo;s baffling tbh, this should be a leverage trade for you guys I can&rsquo;t make sense of it, I feel like if anything could there have been some secret Caruso sauce telling them I only want OKC but even then it still doesn&rsquo;t make sense because of how early this is, you just don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t roll over like that.</p>

<p>And I get the point of the original post value wise you can argue Giddey is competitive with Caruso esp long term.  But this isn&rsquo;t about pure value its about negotiating power and its super confusing how this trade played out like OKC had upper hand.</p>

      <label for="l9kaa8t" class="commentText"><p>Right, even if OKC’s own picks are too good next year, they have picks from other teams that might be good.</p>

<p>Plus I read a Bull reporter complaining that Giddy is now behind a bunch of other Bulls guard prospects, so if they were going for a young player, shouldn’t it have been at a different position with more roster room?</p>

      <label for="l9kplhs" class="commentText"><p>The thing about Giddey-type players (big but with passing/handling abilities) is that they let you play combo-guard types rather than needing a true PG. He could fit well with Dosunmu and White if the coaching staff is willing to get a bit creative.</p>

<p>He’s in the class of players like OG and Jrue that every team wants (though he’s a bit below both of them imo).</p>

<p> OKC was the best team in the regular season, the Bulls really couldn&rsquo;t pry the 30th pick in what is allegedly a terrible draft from them?  </p>

<p>Or next year&rsquo;s 29th/30th pick? Because they&rsquo;ll be great next year, especially after this trade.</p>

      <label for="l9kumux" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m buying stock in Giddey and I&rsquo;ll tell you why&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Kobe Bryant averaged 30 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 2.2 steals with 45%/38% shooting in 2002-03.</strong></p>

<p>He then allegedly raped someone.  The fallout from that alleged rape caused quite the distraction in the 2003-04 season.  The criminal trial was eventually dropped when the victim refused to testify contingent on Kobe admitting that he now understood she didn&rsquo;t see the encounter as consensual and that the civil suit would proceed.</p>

<p>Said Kobe in his statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year… I also want to make it clear that I do not question the motives of this young woman. No money has been paid to this woman… I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter… I issue this statement today fully aware that while one part of this case ends today, another remains. I understand that the civil case against me will go forward.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surprising amount of people seem to be confused about the difference between criminal trials (potential prison) and civil trials (monetary damages). The civil trial was eventually dropped when Kobe settled out of court for millions.</p>

<p><strong>But let&rsquo;s take a look at Kobe&rsquo;s production during the rape season:</strong></p>

<p>24 points (20% decrease), 5.5 rebounds (20.2% decrease), 5.1 assists (13.5% decrease), 1.7 steals (22.7% decrease), 43.8%/32.7% (14% decrease)</p>

<p>He was also dreadful in the playoffs shooting 41% from the field and 24% from three, singlehandedly shooting the Lakers out of the Finals with 38% shooting from the field and 17% from three.</p>

<p>What does this tell us about Josh Giddey?</p>

<p>Giddey allegedly statutory raped a 15-16 year old girl he allegedly had a relationship with.  It was widely reported that the family had hired Gloria Allred - one of the biggest names in civil litigation.  Police investigated, but the girl and the family was unwilling to cooperate.  Nothing else was reported about the Gloria Allred hire.  Basic common sense/wild speculation would suggest a civil suit was in play but Josh was able to avoid further public embarrassment and a public trial keeping him out of the season/playoffs the good ol settlement route.</p>

<p><strong>Giddey&rsquo;s performance 2022-23:</strong>  16.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 48% shooting</p>

<p><strong>Giddey&rsquo;s rape season in 2024:</strong>  12.3 points (25.9% decrease), 6.4 rebounds (18.9% decrease), 4.8 assists (22.5% decrease), 47.5% shooting</p>

<p>Like Kobe, Giddey was also dreadful in the playoffs during his rape season shooting a miserable Kobe-rape-season-esque 43.2% FG and 18.8%  3p% in their eliminated series.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re following along, based on the sample size of Kobe and Giddey, we can objectively say that NBA players with rape allegations hovering over their season will see a 20% decrease in statistical output across the board.</p>

<p>Ironically, Kobe at one point post-rape requested a trade and nearly was traded to, of all teams, the Chicago Bulls.  Apparently the Bulls are pretty receptive to alleged sexual offenders.  That trade never ended up happening, but in a post-rape Lakers world, Kobe did eventually rebound and have some of his greatest statistic seasons ever.  Let&rsquo;s jump forward 2 seasons post-rape and highlight his 2005-06 season for a 45 win Laker squad.  In that season, Kobe averaged a career high 35.4 points per game on 45% shooting.</p>

<p>35.4 points = 18% increase from Kobe&rsquo;s 2002-03 season</p>

<p>35.4 points = 47.5% increase from Kobe&rsquo;s rape season</p>

<p>Lets say GIddey sees a similar 18% pre-rape season or 47.5% rape season bump in his stats.  He&rsquo;d average the following:</p>

<p><strong>18% increase on GIddey&rsquo;s pre-rape season stats:</strong>  19.59 points, 9.3 rebounds, 7.3 assists</p>

<p><strong>47.5% increase on Giddey&rsquo;s rape season stats:</strong>  18.1 points, 9.4 rebounds, 7.1 assists</p>

<p>Ya&rsquo;ll aint ready for post rape allegation Giddey.</p>

<p>Bulls are blowing it up and have no need for Caruso. He’s a very good role player but he’s not returning a star’s haul in a trade. Giddey, for all his warts, is a talented young prospect. He’s only 21 - he’ll develop immensely and almost surely turn out better than Caruso.</p>

<p>I mean there had to have been better trade offers with picks included , was Giddey really the best option?</p>

<p>DeMar’s probably gone , so there’s a huge hole for scoring , maybe this move would entail more movement as opposed to the heliocentrism offense</p>

Suddenly they have a way better roster so he played less and it’s blasphemy to acquire him for a 30 year old role player.

      <label for="l9k60y4" class="commentText"><p>All your points are irrelevant. You are essentially arguing why Giddey makes more sense for the Bulls. I don&rsquo;t think anyone is going to dispute that.</p>

<p>The problem is the value. The Bulls could have gotten way more at the deadline but their moronic owner decided to pretend they are a contender. They likely could have gotten way more now as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is INSANELY valuable to every single team in the league trying to win. You would be hard pressed to find a role player more valuable to a contender than Caruso when you factor in that contract. All this makes him an A+ addition for any GM in the league.</p>

<p>Yet the best they could do is a one of the worst shooting guards in the NBA who is unathletic? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think Giddey can be a solid player IF he can fix his shooting but damn&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l9k97rb" class="commentText"><p>It’s a great even trade completely about fit. Caruso will mesh perfectly with the Thunder as a win now piece. Giddey will probably get the ball back in his hands on the Bulls and continue his rise and development. This is the most normal trade I’ve seen and people are acting like it was a LeBron for Michael Carter Williams or something. It’s a great trade. NBA fans just like to hate on shit.</p>

<p>Have nothing against Josh personally, but he really was a horrible player for us. Man can&rsquo;t shoot, loves his floaters but aren&rsquo;t effective at it, when he&rsquo;s focused he&rsquo;s an average defender at best.</p>

<p>Man&rsquo;s only redeeming quality for me was his stationary passing, he likes his out of bounds plays for sure. He can also see cuts when he stops his dribble. Other than that, good riddance really.</p>

<p>He will go on a good streak during the season at times which will make fans go &ldquo;oh?&rdquo; and then the regression to the mean hits soon thereafter.</p>

      <label for="l9k5z3o" class="commentText"><p>100% agree.</p>

<p>Giddey is going to be 22 while Caruso is about to turn 31 this season. Caruso is a great defender, but he can&rsquo;t even start on the mediocre bulls. He&rsquo;s injury prone and not great offensively. Giddey isn&rsquo;t good on defense, and he regressed as a shooter, but he&rsquo;s a high upside swing, great size, good Play maker, and you think he can get his shot back to something more league average.</p>

<p>I like this trade more for Chicago than OKC, because I don&rsquo;t think wing defense was OKCs flaw.</p>

Giddey&rsquo;s ceiling is much higher than that. Yes you&rsquo;ve got the sure thing in Caruso vs the prospect in Giddey but there&rsquo;s really not much of a risk there unless he does a Ben Simmons and goes mental.</p>

<p>maybe some better gm could&rsquo;ve gotten more for caruso if he was traded before with a desperate almost contender, but as it is now it is fine. giddey is on average better than most top 10 picks in most drafts, and this one is not a particularly promising draft anyways.</p>

      <label for="l9kxpsm" class="commentText"><p>Agree. Giddey is a 21yo primary ball-handler and OKC had him playing off-ball and standing in the corner watching SGA and his massive usage rate.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t many 30yo primary ball-handlers who can make that adjustment without some pain. Giddey was trying to do it all with a massive negative off-court spotlight on him, as well.</p>

<p>I fully expect the Thunder will be better with Caruso next season.</p>

<p>I also fully expect in years to come OKC will have some &ldquo;Dang. Could&rsquo;ve used this version of Giddey.&rdquo; moments. There is a long list of talented players who develop a respectable jumpshot as they approach their mid-20s.</p>

<p>Giddey is a young prospect with high upside if he can find his shot again.</p>

<p>Caruso immediately makes OKC better and removes OKC’s biggest weakness which was hiding Giddey on D (bad fit).</p>

<p>I think everyone’s overreacting about a first round pick that would have likely been late anyway.</p>

<p>Everyone overvalues picks.</p>

<p>OKC just got an incredible starter/role player for cheap, though. It&rsquo;s like the Celtics trading for Jrue Holiday last year.</p>

      <label for="l9kvj1j" class="commentText"><p>He’s legitimately one of the top 5-7 wing defenders in the league and he can hit open 3s and is great at keeping the ball moving. Probably the best 5th starter/1st guy off the bench in the league. If Iggy was a 10 in that role Caruso is probably a 9. So he’s not mediocre, but he shouldn’t have gotten much more of a return which is why the Bulls didn’t get it despite them trying to strong arm more from teams for the past 6-7 months.</p>

      <label for="l9kpvhb" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a few things behind the trade itself as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is a win now player, so trading him away means the Bulls are no longer trying to win now, which is fine.</p>

<p>But they are repeating mistakes of the past in trading proven players for unproven ones and hoping they pan out.</p>

<p>Caruso for Giddey indicated ownership is still hoping to have their cake and eat it too. They want to rebuild the lineup without ever being really bad.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see similar young players coming back for Lavine or Ball or Vuc instead of picks.</p>

<p>Which means we are going to be bad but not bad enough to get a crack at a franchise caliber talent in the draft, limp into the play in tournament and rebuild again in 6 or 7 years.</p>

<p>I can only surmise that Giddey was viewed by the Bulls office as being a better fit than Caruso.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Caruso is a bad player, but might be a case of &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not what the Bulls need as compared to someone like Giddey.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I could see Giddey being out of the league within 3 years or this being a mini Harden for K-Mart disaster. </p>

<p> I am cautiously optimistic but I do really think this trade could blow up for us in a bad way. Giddeys value is at an all time low but he is extremely talented. </p>

<p> Would not surprise me one bit to see this being in one of those &ldquo;six years ago, here&rsquo;s what people thought of the Giddey trade&rdquo; type posts, posted by a sixers flair. </p>

<p> Either way, let&rsquo;s see what happens in a few seasons from now.</p>

      <label for="l9l1t6w" class="commentText"><p>Between this year and last year, Caruso&rsquo;s trade value has been through the roof. Virtually every team that&rsquo;s trying to win playoff games would call for him. Value was nuts coming off an all defense 1st team with 2 years on his deal. Spent the first half of this season showing he was still on that level. We decline to trade him at any point over the last 2 seasons for the sake of &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; (a slur on the bulls subreddit rn). This did nothing except lower his value. Instead of trading one of the best defensive guards with 2 years on his deal, or 1 and a half years on his deal, he&rsquo;s now an expiring contract. No matter how good you are, your value goes down if you&rsquo;re an expiring deal.</p>

<p>The main hurt of this trade is what we COULD have gotten. We passed up on what was likely plenty of great trades so that we could fight for the 9th seed. This FO has done nothing except preach continuity when everyone and their grandma could see that this team badly needs a rebuild. We sold Caruso lower than we could have. We will lose Drummond for nothing, we are going to trade Zach for nothing, we are going to overpay DeRozan and will be again looking to try to offload another bad contract. We have PWill to pay, and pretty soon, will have Giddey to pay. And then, after all that, we will be the 10th seed.</p>

      <label for="l9l99by" class="commentText"><p>Unpopular opinion: I think it’s a great trade for the bulls, 21 year old that had a great rookie year just a year b4, 16/7/6 rookie year, had a bad year last year but put up 12/6/4 to Caruso 10/3/3 his career year…know I do know the thunder just got better by trading giddy for Caruso, but that’s fit purposes… I think it was a great trade for the bulls and a great trade for the thunds</p>

Kyle Kuzma ain’t cooking up a 22 piece every game if he’s on the Bucks/Heat/Wolves/Pacers/Knicks but he gets that or more because the Wizards fucking suck.</p>

AC&rsquo;s a high value player even with his expiring contract, because he&rsquo;s an in demand role player. Giddey&rsquo;s a raw prospect with decent upside and a down year. Imo their trade value isn&rsquo;t the same. The bulls are gonna be fine, but surely they could&rsquo;ve gotten more out of this.</p>

Last season, the bulls were offered a 1st round pick for him, but they didn&rsquo;t want it, and you&rsquo;re saying caruso is old while giddey is young and can develop but his basically ben simmons with pedo allegations</p>

<p>And for the bulls who refuse to rebuild and always say they are trying to win now, why would they trade a young piece, hoping he will develop and trade away a win now player so i really looks like they don&rsquo;t know what they are doing thats my opinion tho.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t like they traded him to the Suns where picks are scarce.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s also a bit puzzling, if the Bulls are in a win now mode, getting a 21 year old playmaker coming off a bum season is quite a big risk.  Couple that with trading away your defensive stopper and one of the best defensive guards in the league, there should have been more value.</p>

<p>It might work, time will tell, but as of now it seems a risky trade where the return isn&rsquo;t worth the risk.</p>
