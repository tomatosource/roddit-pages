      <p>Caruso is a 30 year old guard that relies on his athleticism, giddy is a 21 year old raw prospect who had a really bad year compared to his previous season</p>

<p>Caruso is the better player right now but if giddey produces the same as he did in 2023 then id say the trade is even just based on pure talent.</p>

<p>Caruso also only has 1 year left on his contract, meaning he is a UFA in 2026 and EVERY team in the league will be wanting him as a role player, meaning his cost is going to shoot up and OKC will need to pay him</p>

<p>finally, the fact that the bulls didnt get a pick isnt really that big a deal, they still should have, but if OKC is contending for the next few years (which they will be) the pick would be in the late first round anyway.</p>

<p>I might just be stupid so feel free to roast me</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine Giddey being the best haul possible for a piece that valuable even if the Bulls themselves don&rsquo;t see a use for him</p>

<p>Also just not getting any picks for a rebuilding team when you&rsquo;re making a trade with a team that has like 500 picks is kind of funny</p>

<p>This, IMO. The Bulls are obsessed with tall/long guards and our only &ldquo;true&rdquo; PG is Lonzo Ball who posted a dunking clip on insta within the last 2 years. And what bulls fans have forgotten is that even when he was healthy, he was a full court PG and resorted to catch and shoot 3&rsquo;s in the half court. Another tall PG with hopes of passing (and lack of shooting) is right up Billy D/AK&rsquo;s alley.</p>

His ability to play floor general, hit the 3 at a really respectable rate, and defend at a high level made him such a complete player.

      <label for="l9ksz86" class="commentText"><p>He was absolutely not a floor general. Derozan and Lavine took turns playing halfcourt PG when he was in. He was a Marcus Smart or this years Jrue type player who could also do the Ben Simmons and find shooters on a fast break. But yes, he was very good in that role and him and Caruso were a terrifying defensive backcourt.</p>

      <label for="l9latie" class="commentText"><p>But still it&rsquo;s their job to play hardball and try to get the best return possible. Even if they desperately love Giddey and think he&rsquo;s got all-nba upside. Its only June! The season literally just ended and the team your dealing with controls an outsized portion of picks going forward.  It&rsquo;s baffling tbh, this should be a leverage trade for you guys I can&rsquo;t make sense of it, I feel like if anything could there have been some secret Caruso sauce telling them I only want OKC but even then it still doesn&rsquo;t make sense because of how early this is, you just don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t roll over like that.</p>

<p>And I get the point of the original post value wise you can argue Giddey is competitive with Caruso esp long term.  But this isn&rsquo;t about pure value its about negotiating power and its super confusing how this trade played out like OKC had upper hand.</p>

<p>With the report that we&rsquo;ve floated 15 varying offers to Sixers and the Jazz for Lavine, I think our FO just talks too much. Like a rigid, needy ex or something that forgot shutting the fuck up sometimes yields better results. It makes it easy for opposing GMs to handle things on their terms, and I think that&rsquo;s what happened here.</p>

      <label for="l9mdkqc" class="commentText"><p>The problem is that Caruso was wanted by all the “contenders,” which means any picks they got would probably be late-round picks.</p>

<p>Other than late-round picks, the rumor is that they got offered a “top 10 pick” in this year&rsquo;s draft. Since Caruso is only really useful to contenders, that pick was probably the Grizzlies #9 pick. So then the question becomes, is whoever is available at #9 a better prospect than Giddey?</p>

<p>Here are the prospects who seem like they’ll be available according to consensus mock drafts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ron Holland</strong> is probably the prospect on this list that makes the most sense to take over Giddey. However, I could understand if a front-office thought differently.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Nikola Topic</strong> has similar strengths and weaknesses to Giddey, but his injury concerns would scare me. The only skill he’s clearly better than Giddey at is scoring around the rim, and even that may not carry over when he’s matched up against NBA level athletes.</li>
<li><strong>Dalton Knecht</strong> doesn’t really make any sense on the Bulls roster. As an athletic, scoring-focused, 6’5” Guard with a good jumper, and bad defense, his ceiling is basically a worse version of Zach LaVine or Coby White, without the passing upside.</li>
<li><strong>Rob Dillingham</strong> would be even more of a mess on defense than Giddey.</li>
<li><strong>Tidjane Salaun</strong> is another player I would personally select over Giddey, but he’s <em>super</em> raw and will take a while to develop (if he ever does). Giddey is going to be noticeably more impactful for at least the next 2-3 seasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are any of those guys clearly better than a 21 year old 6’6” PG who’s already put up a 17/7/6 season in the NBA?</p>

      <label for="l9meo8w" class="commentText"><p>The only other option we know of is a “top 10” pick from a team at the trade deadline. Since the Grizzlies are the only top 10 team that’s looking to immediately contend, it was probably their #9 pick.</p>

<p>Here are some of the prospects that are likely to be available at #9:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ron Holland</li>
<li>Nikola Topic</li>
<li>Dalton Knecht</li>
<li>Rob Dillingham</li>
<li>Tidjane Salaun</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though he struggled this season, Giddey is still a 21 year old, 6’6” PG that has already put up a 17/7/6 season in the NBA. Knowing that, are any of those players listed above <em>clearly</em> better prospects than Giddey?</p>

<p>Unless we are talking about a pick that can realistically turn into a top5 or max Top10 pick, getting a player like giddy is the best thing you can hope for when using said pick.</p>

I think you guys have <em>7</em> picks next year, 5 FRPs and 2 seconds. OKC can&rsquo;t use all 7 in the draft, so some of them have to be dealt. A smarter FO should have been able to at least poach 1 or 2 of the second round picks you guys have over the next 5 drafts. Hell, Hayward netted young players and 2 seconds. Caruso is undoubtedly more valuable than Hayward</p>

<p>People have said this for years, but it isn’t really possible for FRPs to flatly lose value due to time or abundance. The value is entirely hinged on the trajectory of the each pick’s team record and lottery position.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>OKC can&rsquo;t use all 7 in the draft, so some of them have to be dealt.</p>

<p>This is a fair point, but we actually have been trading them (they were just boring trades, so it didn’t get much attention). We traded FRPs for future FRPs at the 2021 and 2022 drafts.</p>

<p>I guess this is the best solution. There&rsquo;s always going to be a GM desperate for &ldquo;now&rdquo; picks, so OKC can really just refresh their supply if they&rsquo;re clever. Thanks for the reply!</p>

He’s an exceptional passer as well, but he unlocks a whole lot of mismatches where he posts up against smaller guards and he has the ability to drive against taller forwards.  Giddey is still just 21 ie younger than JDub or Holmgren. He may not ever be a great outside shooter.  But if he gets to have the ball in his hands, something that wasn’t going to happen consistently in OKC, he’s going to be in that tier just below all star level IMO.  I’d be buying up Giddey stocks right now.</p>

      <label for="l9kumux" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m buying stock in Giddey and I&rsquo;ll tell you why&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Kobe Bryant averaged 30 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 2.2 steals with 45%/38% shooting in 2002-03.</strong></p>

<p>He then allegedly raped someone.  The fallout from that alleged rape caused quite the distraction in the 2003-04 season.  The criminal trial was eventually dropped when the victim refused to testify contingent on Kobe admitting that he now understood she didn&rsquo;t see the encounter as consensual and that the civil suit would proceed.</p>

<p>Said Kobe in his statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year… I also want to make it clear that I do not question the motives of this young woman. No money has been paid to this woman… I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter… I issue this statement today fully aware that while one part of this case ends today, another remains. I understand that the civil case against me will go forward.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surprising amount of people seem to be confused about the difference between criminal trials (potential prison) and civil trials (monetary damages). The civil trial was eventually dropped when Kobe settled out of court for millions.</p>

<p><strong>But let&rsquo;s take a look at Kobe&rsquo;s production during the rape season:</strong></p>

<p>24 points (20% decrease), 5.5 rebounds (20.2% decrease), 5.1 assists (13.5% decrease), 1.7 steals (22.7% decrease), 43.8%/32.7% (14% decrease)</p>

<p>He was also dreadful in the playoffs shooting 41% from the field and 24% from three, singlehandedly shooting the Lakers out of the Finals with 38% shooting from the field and 17% from three.</p>

<p>What does this tell us about Josh Giddey?</p>

<p>Giddey allegedly statutory raped a 15-16 year old girl he allegedly had a relationship with.  It was widely reported that the family had hired Gloria Allred - one of the biggest names in civil litigation.  Police investigated, but the girl and the family was unwilling to cooperate.  Nothing else was reported about the Gloria Allred hire.  Basic common sense/wild speculation would suggest a civil suit was in play but Josh was able to avoid further public embarrassment and a public trial keeping him out of the season/playoffs the good ol settlement route.</p>

<p><strong>Giddey&rsquo;s performance 2022-23:</strong>  16.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 48% shooting</p>

<p><strong>Giddey&rsquo;s rape season in 2024:</strong>  12.3 points (25.9% decrease), 6.4 rebounds (18.9% decrease), 4.8 assists (22.5% decrease), 47.5% shooting</p>

<p>Like Kobe, Giddey was also dreadful in the playoffs during his rape season shooting a miserable Kobe-rape-season-esque 43.2% FG and 18.8%  3p% in their eliminated series.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re following along, based on the sample size of Kobe and Giddey, we can objectively say that NBA players with rape allegations hovering over their season will see a 20% decrease in statistical output across the board.</p>

<p>Ironically, Kobe at one point post-rape requested a trade and nearly was traded to, of all teams, the Chicago Bulls.  Apparently the Bulls are pretty receptive to alleged sexual offenders.  That trade never ended up happening, but in a post-rape Lakers world, Kobe did eventually rebound and have some of his greatest statistic seasons ever.  Let&rsquo;s jump forward 2 seasons post-rape and highlight his 2005-06 season for a 45 win Laker squad.  In that season, Kobe averaged a career high 35.4 points per game on 45% shooting.</p>

<p>35.4 points = 18% increase from Kobe&rsquo;s 2002-03 season</p>

<p>35.4 points = 47.5% increase from Kobe&rsquo;s rape season</p>

<p>Lets say GIddey sees a similar 18% pre-rape season or 47.5% rape season bump in his stats.  He&rsquo;d average the following:</p>

<p><strong>18% increase on GIddey&rsquo;s pre-rape season stats:</strong>  19.59 points, 9.3 rebounds, 7.3 assists</p>

<p><strong>47.5% increase on Giddey&rsquo;s rape season stats:</strong>  18.1 points, 9.4 rebounds, 7.1 assists</p>

<p>Ya&rsquo;ll aint ready for post rape allegation Giddey.</p>

Suddenly they have a way better roster so he played less and it’s blasphemy to acquire him for a 30 year old role player. I know Caruso is an elite defender but in 25 mins per game last year giddey put up more points rebs and assists per game than Caruso ever has</p>

<p>Bulls are winning this trade from a cap/contract value perspective imo, whereas OKC wins in terms of playoff impact.</p>

As a prospect Giddey would go #1 in this draft, while his current self is even better than that. It’s not draft hate going too far it’s objectively true. Like <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of this class is 21+ anyway, so getting a guy who’s about to turn 22 and has already played 3 NBA seasons is better than drafting a rookie who will probably bust.</p>

      <label for="l9kxpsm" class="commentText"><p>Agree. Giddey is a 21yo primary ball-handler and OKC had him playing off-ball and standing in the corner watching SGA and his massive usage rate.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t many 30yo primary ball-handlers who can make that adjustment without some pain. Giddey was trying to do it all with a massive negative off-court spotlight on him, as well.</p>

<p>I fully expect the Thunder will be better with Caruso next season.</p>

<p>I also fully expect in years to come OKC will have some &ldquo;Dang. Could&rsquo;ve used this version of Giddey.&rdquo; moments. There is a long list of talented players who develop a respectable jumpshot as they approach their mid-20s.</p>

<p>Bulls are blowing it up and have no need for Caruso. He’s a very good role player but he’s not returning a star’s haul in a trade. Giddey, for all his warts, is a talented young prospect. He’s only 21 - he’ll develop immensely and almost surely turn out better than Caruso.</p>

<p>Caruso is INSANELY valuable to every single team in the league trying to win. You would be hard pressed to find a role player more valuable to a contender than Caruso when you factor in that contract. All this makes him an A+ addition for any GM in the league.</p>

<p>Yet the best they could do is a one of the worst shooting guards in the NBA who is unathletic? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think Giddey can be a solid player IF he can fix his shooting but damn&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l9mm5r4" class="commentText"><p>Anyone trying to say there was better value at last years deadline is harping on past shit, move on. Can’t go back.</p>

<p>As for the value now, the ONLY other players on the block from win now teams that I would take for Caruso would be Kuminga or Dejounte Murray. But likely those were turned down. So tell me exactly who would’ve been a better target? (Don’t say Pritchard- small guard who will always be a defensive limitation and would likely struggle on offense outside of Bostons ecosystem)</p>

<p>Cry about the picks we didn’t get all you want but Caruso was gone next year as a FA anyway and waiting until this deadline runs the risk of Caruso getting hurt and losing value. (I love AC but he does get hurt a lot as a result of his hustle) late first rounders aren’t bad but I’d rather bank on a 21 yo who has already been in the league and made that adjustment.</p>

<p>Anyone saying the grizzlies top 10 pick is out of their mind. NO franchise trades a top ten pick for a 30 yo role player. Any scenario where we do this means we give up multiple picks which is the opposite of what a rebuild team should do.</p>

<p>Reddit fans just love playing armchair GM and ignore all the risks or downfalls their strategies have smh</p>

The overreaction to one playoff series is crazy. He’s a 21yo who was a major contributor on a 1 seed. Bulls have the luxury of giving him the ball and letting him work out his game.</p>

<p>maybe some better gm could&rsquo;ve gotten more for caruso if he was traded before with a desperate almost contender, but as it is now it is fine. giddey is on average better than most top 10 picks in most drafts, and this one is not a particularly promising draft anyways.</p>

      <label for="l9k5z3o" class="commentText"><p>100% agree.</p>

<p>Giddey is going to be 22 while Caruso is about to turn 31 this season. Caruso is a great defender, but he can&rsquo;t even start on the mediocre bulls. He&rsquo;s injury prone and not great offensively. Giddey isn&rsquo;t good on defense, and he regressed as a shooter, but he&rsquo;s a high upside swing, great size, good Play maker, and you think he can get his shot back to something more league average.</p>

<p>I like this trade more for Chicago than OKC, because I don&rsquo;t think wing defense was OKCs flaw.</p>

      <label for="l9krp9l" class="commentText"><p>I thought the bulls originally had an offer to trade Caruso for 2 FRPs. So I thought they were idiotic for not taking that.</p>

<p>Turns out they had only 1 FRP offered. And it was in the weak 2024 draft. So now, it makes sense to trade for Giddey, as they know what to expect.</p>

<p>OKC just got an incredible starter/role player for cheap, though. It&rsquo;s like the Celtics trading for Jrue Holiday last year.</p>

The idea that the Thunder should have included first-round picks in the trade is crazy to me. The Bulls need to rebuild around young guys and don&rsquo;t need a 30-year-old stopper.</p>

      <label for="l9kpvhb" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a few things behind the trade itself as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is a win now player, so trading him away means the Bulls are no longer trying to win now, which is fine.</p>

<p>But they are repeating mistakes of the past in trading proven players for unproven ones and hoping they pan out.</p>

<p>Caruso for Giddey indicated ownership is still hoping to have their cake and eat it too. They want to rebuild the lineup without ever being really bad.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see similar young players coming back for Lavine or Ball or Vuc instead of picks.</p>

<p>Which means we are going to be bad but not bad enough to get a crack at a franchise caliber talent in the draft, limp into the play in tournament and rebuild again in 6 or 7 years.</p>

<p>I could see Giddey being out of the league within 3 years or this being a mini Harden for K-Mart disaster. </p>

<p> I am cautiously optimistic but I do really think this trade could blow up for us in a bad way. Giddeys value is at an all time low but he is extremely talented. </p>

<p> Would not surprise me one bit to see this being in one of those &ldquo;six years ago, here&rsquo;s what people thought of the Giddey trade&rdquo; type posts, posted by a sixers flair. </p>

I dont think Caruso is actually as valuable as people are pretending he is either. Giddey fits the mold of a player who they know worked exceptionally well for them in Lonzo, and he also has plenty of upside with him being so young. Im not sure what better trades there would be out there, maybe they could get a first but probably not a great first. Jrue Holiday was just traded for basically nothing and hes a way better version of Caruso. Teams arent willing to spend big on old role playing guards</p>

      <label for="l9kttu6" class="commentText"><p>If they can convince Derozan to sign and trade, and build around Lavine, Giddey and Williams, sure. Giddey is a good young player to build around. Can definitely hold his own as a starter on a playoff team.</p>

<p>If they run it back with Giddey in place of Caruso, meh.</p>

      <label for="l9kykfr" class="commentText"><p>While a long lapsed basketball fan and totally unaware of how the Bulls have struggled recently. I think these days having seen this year&rsquo;s playoffs, that there is a big motivation right now towards Team Composition builds.</p>

<p>I can only surmise that Giddey was viewed by the Bulls office as being a better fit than Caruso.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Caruso is a bad player, but might be a case of &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not what the Bulls need as compared to someone like Giddey.&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="l9lxi0f" class="commentText"><p>It’s not a horrible trade I guess depends how you value giddey. Still they could’ve gotten more I think for caruso. He’s a good defensive guard on a 10 mill expiring. Chicago has a lot of guards. Is giddey a good fit for them? </p>

<p>A kinda ball dominant guard who isn’t much of a shooter or great off ball. And I know the bulls don’t wanna act like a rebuilding team but that’s what they are, weird to not get any first round picks back in this trade </p>

      <label for="l9m395s" class="commentText"><p>I mean I&rsquo;ve been constantly told the past like 6 months that this years draft is utter dogshit past like pick 3. So having a second round pick isn&rsquo;t too big of a deal. Obviously still try to get it because it couldn&rsquo;t hurt but that part is definitely overblown. To me it comes down to can Chicago develop Giddey well enough to make the trade &lsquo;equal&rsquo;</p>

      <label for="l9m4pun" class="commentText"><p>I agree with OP. OKC easily could&rsquo;ve held the line and said just giddey, take it or leave it</p>

<p>now the bulls have to choose between giddey or picks from another team. no one is giving the &ldquo;godfather&rdquo; offer for caruso so maybe you get two mid-to-late FRPs at best</p>

<p>giddey was a #6 pick, and for awhile, that looked like a very good pick. if you believe last year was a temporary blip, then trading caruso for a potentially all star PG is a great trade. even if it doesn&rsquo;t pan out, I still think the risk-reward was good enough (compared to rolling the dice on two somewhat mediocre FRPs) that it wasn&rsquo;t a bad trade</p>

There aren&rsquo;t a lot of players who can handle the ball like he does at his size. Sure, the Bulls probably could or should have gotten a pick, but acting like it&rsquo;s highway robbery is kinda too much.</p>

      <label for="l9mez8o" class="commentText"><p>Making the trade wasn’t the wrong idea but not getting any draft assets back from a team with the most draft picks in the league who clearly wanted to move off Giddy is basketball malpractice.</p>

<p>Bulls gave them a roster upgrade for free as Giddy was already regressing and didn’t fit the team they’re building. Now if Giddy becomes an all star people will forget about these details but in reality they still could’ve got him and at least a 1st for maybe a few 2nds.</p>
