      <p>Caruso is a 30 year old guard that relies on his athleticism, giddy is a 21 year old raw prospect who had a really bad year compared to his previous season</p>

<p>Caruso is the better player right now but if giddey produces the same as he did in 2023 then id say the trade is even just based on pure talent.</p>

<p>Caruso also only has 1 year left on his contract, meaning he is a UFA in 2026 and EVERY team in the league will be wanting him as a role player, meaning his cost is going to shoot up and OKC will need to pay him</p>

<p>finally, the fact that the bulls didnt get a pick isnt really that big a deal, they still should have, but if OKC is contending for the next few years (which they will be) the pick would be in the late first round anyway.</p>

<p>I might just be stupid so feel free to roast me</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine Giddey being the best haul possible for a piece that valuable even if the Bulls themselves don&rsquo;t see a use for him</p>

<p>Also just not getting any picks for a rebuilding team when you&rsquo;re making a trade with a team that has like 500 picks is kind of funny</p>

<p>This, IMO. The Bulls are obsessed with tall/long guards and our only &ldquo;true&rdquo; PG is Lonzo Ball who posted a dunking clip on insta within the last 2 years. And what bulls fans have forgotten is that even when he was healthy, he was a full court PG and resorted to catch and shoot 3&rsquo;s in the half court. Another tall PG with hopes of passing (and lack of shooting) is right up Billy D/AK&rsquo;s alley.</p>

His ability to play floor general, hit the 3 at a really respectable rate, and defend at a high level made him such a complete player.

      <label for="l9kgc6k" class="commentText"><p>Which contenders were going to give them a better player than Giddey? It’s fine to say it’s a shit trade because the Bulls need to blow it all the way up and this isn’t helping their cause but they clearly don’t want to do that. They want to continue fighting for play-in spots in perpetuity. Picks don’t help them do that.</p>

<p>To me, a shit trade is one in which a team has a goal in mind, and is likely to fail to achieve it as a result of the trade. That’s not the case here. We can talk shit about how stupid the Bulls’ goals are all day but this trade helps them get where they want to go more than anything another contender could offer them.</p>

<p>OKC don’t need to do a damn thing about their picks, it’s super easy to trade them on draft night (or earlier) for picks in following years. You think they can’t just trade the 12th pick this year for Cleveland’s 2025 first or something? Two seconds this year for a shit team’s 2026 second? They haven’t shown any willingness to move any of their picks to date, it’s not like it’s some free-for-all Chicago missed out on.</p>

They already proved he doesn&rsquo;t fit the team in the playoffs and they probably have to move or replace him.  Bulls could easily just run things back with Caruso, it&rsquo;s not like swapping him for Giddey does much for them.  Like the trade is acceptable but it clearly matters more for OKC which is why Chicago should have been able to get a little more.</p>

      <label for="l9kk75b" class="commentText"><p>Having to move somebody (which I agree, OKC clearly did) doesn’t have any bearing on a player’s value if there are multiple suitors. Look at when the Jazz blew the Gobert/Mitchell core up, for example. As for potential destinations for Giddey, there are a few.</p>

<p>San Antonio comes to mind as a team in desperate need of somebody who can pass the ball properly, and Giddey matches their timeline much better than their other potential options even if he is also worse than some of them. They’ve got a few good-not-great players to spare, and a boatload of picks. Depending on what Utah wants to do I could see them being interested. They also have some interesting role players, and of course Lauri is OKC’s big fish if you wanted to turn it into a seriously big package. The Warriors could try to continue some “two timelines” nonsense if Klay leaves and slot Giddey in next to Steph as another guy to set him up. The Heat could look to heavily retool if Jimmy goes, Giddey gives them somewhat of a starting point for that.</p>

<p>That’s not to say any of these are <em>good</em> options for those teams, but they are realistic to varying degrees (Heat and Warriors less so, SA and Utah very realistic). There’s a market for a guy like Giddey, even off a bad year.</p>

      <label for="l9kplhs" class="commentText"><p>The thing about Giddey-type players (big but with passing/handling abilities) is that they let you play combo-guard types rather than needing a true PG. He could fit well with Dosunmu and White if the coaching staff is willing to get a bit creative.</p>

<p>Bulls are blowing it up and have no need for Caruso. He’s a very good role player but he’s not returning a star’s haul in a trade. Giddey, for all his warts, is a talented young prospect. He’s only 21 - he’ll develop immensely and almost surely turn out better than Caruso.</p>

      <label for="l9k3dex" class="commentText"><p>true, but caruso being 30 means his athleticism is going to go away sooner rather then later</p>

<p>Hes still a great shooter and solid playmaker so it probs wont matter but generally when a players athleticism drops their defensive ability drops</p>

      <label for="l9k60y4" class="commentText"><p>All your points are irrelevant. You are essentially arguing why Giddey makes more sense for the Bulls. I don&rsquo;t think anyone is going to dispute that.</p>

<p>The problem is the value. The Bulls could have gotten way more at the deadline but their moronic owner decided to pretend they are a contender. They likely could have gotten way more now as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is INSANELY valuable to every single team in the league trying to win. You would be hard pressed to find a role player more valuable to a contender than Caruso when you factor in that contract. All this makes him an A+ addition for any GM in the league.</p>

<p>Yet the best they could do is a one of the worst shooting guards in the NBA who is unathletic? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think Giddey can be a solid player IF he can fix his shooting but damn&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l9k97rb" class="commentText"><p>It’s a great even trade completely about fit. Caruso will mesh perfectly with the Thunder as a win now piece. Giddey will probably get the ball back in his hands on the Bulls and continue his rise and development. This is the most normal trade I’ve seen and people are acting like it was a LeBron for Michael Carter Williams or something. It’s a great trade. NBA fans just like to hate on shit.</p>

<p>maybe some better gm could&rsquo;ve gotten more for caruso if he was traded before with a desperate almost contender, but as it is now it is fine. giddey is on average better than most top 10 picks in most drafts, and this one is not a particularly promising draft anyways.</p>

      <label for="l9k5z3o" class="commentText"><p>100% agree.</p>

<p>Giddey is going to be 22 while Caruso is about to turn 31 this season. Caruso is a great defender, but he can&rsquo;t even start on the mediocre bulls. He&rsquo;s injury prone and not great offensively. Giddey isn&rsquo;t good on defense, and he regressed as a shooter, but he&rsquo;s a high upside swing, great size, good Play maker, and you think he can get his shot back to something more league average.</p>

<p>I like this trade more for Chicago than OKC, because I don&rsquo;t think wing defense was OKCs flaw.</p>

      <label for="l9kj3ph" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s cause they traded without getting a pick for a valuable asset that a lot of teams wanted. Last season, the bulls were offered a 1st round pick for him, but they didn&rsquo;t want it, and you&rsquo;re saying caruso is old while giddey is young and can develop but his basically ben simmons with pedo allegations</p>

<p>And for the bulls who refuse to rebuild and always say they are trying to win now, why would they trade a young piece, hoping he will develop and trade away a win now player so i really looks like they don&rsquo;t know what they are doing thats my opinion tho.</p>

      <label for="l9kpvhb" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a few things behind the trade itself as well.</p>

<p>Caruso is a win now player, so trading him away means the Bulls are no longer trying to win now, which is fine.</p>

<p>But they are repeating mistakes of the past in trading proven players for unproven ones and hoping they pan out.</p>

<p>Caruso for Giddey indicated ownership is still hoping to have their cake and eat it too. They want to rebuild the lineup without ever being really bad.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see similar young players coming back for Lavine or Ball or Vuc instead of picks.</p>

<p>Which means we are going to be bad but not bad enough to get a crack at a franchise caliber talent in the draft, limp into the play in tournament and rebuild again in 6 or 7 years.</p>

      <label for="l9kag3y" class="commentText"><p>There is absolutely no way that the best offer available for Caruso was Giddey. The reported GSW trade of Moses Moody + a pick is way more valueable bc GS is about to really suck in a few years. I get they didnt want any picks this draft because its considered a weak class but still.</p>

<p>In my oppinion its even worse because Giddey is an on ball playmaker and so you have to take away ball handling minutes from Coby White or Ayo Dosumu both players who IMO have much higher ceilings, so youre stifling the development of your own players.</p>
