      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnu37l/the_asterisk_on_a_title_conversation_is_stupid/"><p>The asterisk on a title conversation is stupid because EVERY title could have an asterisk applied</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I commonly see certain titles getting denigrated because people apply asterisks arbitrarily to them. So I went through each title going back 25 years or so and identified the commonly cited asterisk. True goes to show applying asterisks to titles is dumb.</p>

<p>2024 Celtics - injury plagued east was a cake walk for the Celtics, went into the finals rested.</p>

<p>2023 nuggets - got the good luck of playing two 8 seeds and a 7 seed on their way to a title. “Easiest competition of all time”</p>

<p>2022 Warriors - Benefited from major injuries to the Grizzlies and Nuggets</p>

<p>2021 Bucks - would’ve been stomped in round 2 if not for terrible injury luck for the Nets</p>

<p>2020 Lakers - The bubble was a once in a lifetime, artificial experience, so the results are invalid</p>

<p>2019 Raptors - KD injury</p>

<p>2018 Warriors - CP3 injury</p>

<p>2017 Warriors - Zaza sabotaging Kawhi</p>

<p>2016 Cavs - Draymond suspension, Bogut injury</p>

<p>2015 Warriors - Injuries to Love, Kyrie, Conley, KD</p>

<p>2014 Spurs - Ibaka injury in WCF, sabotaged Lebron by turning off AC</p>

<p>2013 Heat - Long term impacts of Derrick Rose injuries</p>

<p>2012 Heat - Derrick Rose injured</p>

<p>2011 Mavs - historically inexplicable mental collapse from the best basketball player in the world at the least opportune time</p>

<p>2010 Lakers - Kendrick Perkins injury late in the finals drastically impacting Boston in games 6 and 7</p>

<p>2009 Lakers - KG injury, Yao Ming and TMac injuries (Rockets pushed them to 7 without these guys and likely win with them)</p>

<p>2008 Celtics - Andrew Bynum was injured for the finals</p>

<p>2007 Spurs - suspensions of suns players after Horry hip check was totally unfair</p>

<p>2006 Heat - Refs completely favored Heat over Mavs</p>

<p>2005 Spurs - Joe Johnson injury in WCF, Pacers were title favorites, but malice at the palace and the drastic over the top suspensions eliminated them as legit title contenders</p>

<p>2004 Pistons - Karl Malone injury</p>

<p>2003 Spurs - East was historically terrible, Dirk WCF injury, C-Webb injury for Kings</p>

<p>2002 Lakers - East was historically terrible, refs bail out Lakers vs Kings in WCF G7</p>

<p>2001 Lakers - East was historically terrible, sketchy reffing in ECF G7 prevents what felt like a much more balanced, better Bucks team from reaching Finals</p>

<p>2000 Lakers - Tim Duncan injured for playoffs</p>

<p>1999 Spurs - shortened season created invalid, artificial results</p>

<p>To be clear I don’t believe all this asterisks, but it just goes to show it’s dumb to put them on titles. Because if you think hard enough, an asterisk can be put on any title.</p>

      <label for="loky7g3" class="commentText"><p>The “asterisk” conversation is even more stupid when you realize it’s driven by people’s desire to have their team be seen as “deserving” by “neutrals”. NBA fans are the worst about this. More than any other sport. I watch plenty of PL and NFL and everyone pretty much agrees it’s a tribal sport and it’s better for it. NBA fans are the only ones who want every championship to be treated with the reverence of a 2011 Dirk chip when that shit was a complete outlier. This is ANOTHER symptom of modern day NBA fans consuming the NBA like it’s a reality TV drama show than like it’s a competitive sports league.</p>

<p>A team wins a title for its fans. What they think about their own championship is all that matters. Anything outside of that is just bitter losers crying about the objective reality of a banner flying in the rafters forever. I personally could not give a fuck what others think of my team’s championship. I’m sure any reasonable Raptors and Bucks and Nuggets and Lakers fans feel the same. Just enjoy your chip and stop trying to appease the very people who would have shat on your chips regardless of how you’d have won it.</p>

<p>But also, let haters hate. The toxicity breeds intensity and that’s what the league should be about. You don’t have any obligation to be nice about another team’s championship. More than the haters, I take more issue with the Warriors fans that try to appease their haters by “conceding” bullshit points, as if the arguments were ever being made in good faith.</p>

      <label for="lolw345" class="commentText"><p>Spot on with the reality tv show point.</p>

<p>Idk what it is about the NBA that attracts so many people who aren’t even into the sport but moreso into the drama and narratives surrounding it. I don’t see nearly as many pointless arguments about “all-time rankings” and who’s-better-than-who in NFL and NHL discussions.</p>

<p>NBA fans for some reason, just seem to be unable to actually appreciate and enjoy the game and instead choose to feast on drama and toxicity created by media, finding ways to discredit and tear down anything/anyone they don’t like</p>

You don&rsquo;t see this as much anymore but when the Spurs were dominant everyone was jerking themselves over how classy their ring was and how they did everything the &lsquo;proper&rsquo; way. Same with the criticisms of &ldquo;ring culture&rdquo; as if sports fans are stupid for appreciating winners instead of screen assists and DWS</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really as prominent on other basketball social media. I agree that the tribalism of sports makes it more fun</p>

      <label for="lol6nol" class="commentText"><p>Sure but it’s still important context that the format of the season was different for everyone. That’s why there should be an asterisk for “the playoffs were played in a fucking Covid bubble in Disneyland” and not for “yea but Gianni’s was hurt” or whatever.</p>

<p>In 2020, for example, all teams didn&rsquo;t even play the same number of games. We are lucky that no seeding was determined by half a game, though that very thing did happen in MLB in 1972.</p>

<p>in the regular season they didn&rsquo;t play the same number of games. Regular season games determine seeding.</p>

<p>Like I said, we got lucky that no seeds were determined by the extra half-game. But it could have happened (as it did in 1972).</p>

The players, you know, the actual people playing the games have said that the bubble playoffs were harder than other years.  If there really was an asterisk, you’d think that a losing player from 2020 would say it to justify their loss, but nope.</p>

<p>You usually see an asterisk/footnote in a sports history book for various things because it&rsquo;s noting a different circumstance from other normal seasons or a notable historical change (like introducing the shot clock or the ABA merger).</p>

<p>Good example is the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions" target="_blank">list of NBA Champions</a> where the only asterisks are for the 1999, 2012, and 2020 shortened seasons and otherwise when the name of the trophy changed.</p>

      <label for="lonnacm" class="commentText"><p>Thank you.  Yes injuries/weird stuff happens with all teams but some years it’s crazy.  The general rule of thumb I like to use is did the championship team have to beat at least one pretty healthy team that seemed like a legit contender.</p>

<p>Let’s take last years Celtics as an example.  Yes they had to beat the healthy Mavericks.  If Luka had torn his ACL in game 1 I would feel differently considering how injured the teams the Celtics played prior to the Final were.  But they thoroughly stomped a Mavericks team which looked really good the whole playoffs so I don’t think a major asterisk is required.</p>

<p>I think by this logic almost all teams don’t get a major asterisk, and so leaves only a digestible few who can be discussed.  By this logic the only teams that need to be discussed in the last 15 years are the 2015 Warriors (I think a case could have been made for the 2020 Lakers but since then I think we realize Denver was actually a very good team).</p>

      <label for="lokzd12" class="commentText"><p>I understand the point you are trying to make, but “the East was historically weak” is not an asterisk. The western conference champion did not just suddenly appear in the Finals out of thin air. They still had to beat the other teams in the West in order to make it to the Finals, and the best teams in the league so happened to all be in the West during that time period. I don’t see why beating the top teams in the league in the first 3 rounds rather than beating them in the final round is an “asterisk.”</p>

<p>Like, would the 2001 Lakers title be more legitimate if they had played the Spurs in the Finals rather than in the WCF? Of course not.</p>

      <label for="lolv3oe" class="commentText"><p>Boston were by far the best team last season and there was no argument to make about that, but suppose they only had 51 wins in the regular season (would still be #1 seed) then won 4-3 every round. There&rsquo;d be a lot more questioning their title then.</p>

<p>If they had to play in the west they&rsquo;d still be the favourite, but instead of being 25% to repeat they might be only 20%. That&rsquo;s like taking away 4 of their 18 titles. An easier run-in can make a huge difference!</p>

<p>Great players and teams tend to inevitably win anyway. The actual championship won by them is rarely impressive. What&rsquo;s more important is total playoff resume. There are certain champions who won under suspect circumstances and who do not actually have impressive playoff resumes.</p>

<p>How was 2016 harder? It&rsquo;s pretty universally agreed on that if healthy, you can switch the winners of 2015 and 2016 since both had significant injuries to the winning side.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s crazy to say that the 2011 Mavs feels more like a championship that didn&rsquo;t benefit from many if any lucky breaks or severe opponent injuries. It was truly one of the most difficult runs ever</p>

<p>the only asterisks team for me has been the 2021 bucks mainly cause i think everyone healthy, they woulda lost to Nets, Lakers, and probably Clippers and Nuggets, so it&rsquo;s just hard for me to take that one that seriously</p>

<p>I know Donte wasn&rsquo;t the player he is now, but his injury was a fairly substantial loss that isn&rsquo;t really talked about because they went on to win anyways, but PJ Tucker replacing him was a massive blow on both ends of the court that they were somehow able to mitigate.</p>

      <label for="lom5q2b" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m Laker hater but I think if anything the the bubble title deserves a bonus. Scoring averages went through the roof in the bubble and they won with defense. That added a degree of difficulty IMO. They also didn&rsquo;t get the homecourt advantage they had earned as the number one seed.</p>

<p>Also all of the other teams where playing in the same bubble. I don&rsquo;t see how that favored one team over another.</p>

<p>Ironically the Celtics last year were one of the least luck beneficial too. They were running through the postseason like a hot knife through butter regardless of who they played - and they had their own awful luck with KP.</p>

      <label for="loljswt" class="commentText"><p>i don&rsquo;t include injuries in the asterisk conversation because you&rsquo;re right, happens every year. However, the bubble championship actually has an asterisk because it was something that has never happened before. A 3 month break in the middle of the season and then playoffs played infront of virtual fans? You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s something that should be discussed when talking about that season?</p>

Like if we compare the the latest maverick title to the nuggets title 1 is way more impressive then the other. Or the 2015 gsw knocking off the entire nba first team vs the 2020 lakers which had more first team all nba on their team than they faced on there entire run. Still are champions but there are levels.</p>

Only because there was literally a 2 months break and they played in the bubble from a damn pandemic . You cant tell the story of that season without some type of asterisk attached to it. It was literally something that we&rsquo;ll never see again.</p>

<p>He got lucky bc it was actually TWO games that he would have been suspended. But NBA downgraded his AUTOMATIC FLAGRANT 2 to flagrant 1 so he would only miss 1 game.</p>

<p>He got suspended for accumulating 7+ flagrants in the playoffs. Not sure how that is luck for Cavs lol. He was and still is a hot headed undisciplined c*nt.</p>

      <label for="longdmg" class="commentText"><p>The funniest asterisk conversation was Phil Jackson back in 2000 trying to put an asterisk on the Spurs, the team who won the first title after his Bulls broke up</p>

<p>Back then there were no grifters like Skip Bayless and Stephen A on tv and podcasts and social media who would amplify that nonsense, it was all just writers who had a brain and reported on Phil&rsquo;s dumb shit but didn&rsquo;t buy into it and spread it like it was a real conversation worth having, everyone knew he was just being a hater</p>

<p>The discourse that happens with fans is still equally stupid, the same Warriors fans who say Toronto&rsquo;s ring doesn&rsquo;t count because KD and Klay were injured will tell you the Warriors 2022 ring is one of the toughest rings ever even though Jamal Murray and MPJ were hurt for the Nuggets and Ja Morant got hurt in their series with a 2-1 lead, or that Kyrie and Kevin Love being hurt for the Cavs in 2015 doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>

<p>Every ring has a little bit of good luck for the winners and bad luck for the losers and fans can&rsquo;t seem to use their brains half the time and realize there are no asterisks just the way things turn out</p>

<p>2018-2019- Kawhi cheated</p>

<p>2019-2020- Jimmy Butler secretly had the cure to COVID and kept it for himself</p>

<p>2020-2021- only legitimate championship.</p>

<p>2021-2022- Jimmy Butler secretly <em>gave</em> the Bucks COVID</p>

<p>2022-2023- Haliburton pulled a Tonya Harding on Giannis.</p>

<p>You mean the 2002 WCF Game 7 legendary ref bail out where the Lakers (with Shaq btw, the most intentionally fouled player of all time) shot a grand total of 3 more free throws than the Kings and won by 6.</p>

<p>Yeah… Not really buying that one.</p>

The calls were atrocious in that game. The Lakers got 27 free throws in the 4th quarter alone. That&rsquo;s more than they averaged per game. The Kings had a big lead for most of the game and I don&rsquo;t believe they were doing the Hack a Shaq thing.</p>
