There is no need to put money into good TV, because there&rsquo;s so many vapid morons out there that will just blindly consume as much cheap reality TV as the industry can churn out.

<p>The whole point of marketing is to get your name out there and get your product at the forefront of people’s minds. Of course you want less variety as an advertiser, so if that means buying up more slots, so be it, especially if you have a huge marketing war chest </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inventory is the most important factor in sports television, which is why the NFL added an 18th week, the NBA added the In-Season Tournament, and the NCAA is weighing expansion of its basketball tournaments. For all the complaints about the length of the NBA season, having 1,231 regular season/In-Season Tournament games and as many as 105 playoff games that span the entire television season is a significant advantage. (The league is likely to add more inventory through expansion; two additional teams raises the number of games to 1,313.) The NBA’s ceiling may not be what it used to be, but seven figures is a considerable floor given the volume of telecasts. It is reasonable to imagine the league made said volume a point of emphasis in negotiations.</p>

<p>Yet the league’s strong position cannot be explained by volume alone. It also benefits from having those games spread out over most of the year, culminating in a postseason that fully occupies the Q2 months of April, May and June. The broad decline in television viewing that has helped shrink NBA ratings has conversely made it more valuable to advertisers, clearing the field of competition and leaving the league as the primary driver of Q2 ad sales. Over 43 nights of playoff games, the NBA was the most-watched programming 20 times and topped the charts nearly every night in the key adult demographics of 18-34 (41 times), 18-49 (42) and 25-54 (42).</p>

<p>While some have questioned the importance of demographics, it is the case that adults under 35 are simply not watching linear television to any significant degree. Game 4 of this year’s Finals, a historic dud on the court and in the ratings, averaged 47 percent of the viewers in the demographic watching television that night. To be clear, not many of them were. Yet if one wanted to reach adults 18-34 on a Friday night in June, there was only one easily-measured, ad-supported place where they were congregating en masse, and it was not YouTube or Twitch.</p>

      <label for="lg52pk2" class="commentText"><p>So in summary this article is saying:</p>

<p>The NBA’s prime demographic doesn’t really watch television that much, but if someone is watching television in June at all it’s very likely they’re watching an NBA playoff game.</p>

<p>Isn’t that good for the NBA though? It’s the broadcasters/cable companies problem if people aren’t turning on their televisions, if they’re watching anything they’re watching the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lg52xyv" class="commentText"><p>Companies have the leverage when ratings are lows. Regardless of inventory slots. I don’t think you have any idea what you’re talking about. Also most of these contracts have triggers that send money back to the purchaser if ratings hit below a certain threshold. These deals are bad for the distributor, good for the league.

      <label for="lg547fh" class="commentText"><p>Well, you have to adjust for the new reality. The ratings are going down everywhere, &lsquo;secular&rsquo; decline as they say. Live sports is still selling at a premium, first, because of inflation (the same deal should be worth more in raw numbers) and second, because there&rsquo;s only so many options for live programming. They can&rsquo;t all broadcast NFL football, although it&rsquo;s pretty close.</p>

<p>And live sports are preferred because of the engagement for monthly subscriptions. You can&rsquo;t just sign up for one month in July to watch the NFL season, it&rsquo;s too late. So everyone is bidding on it now.</p>

      <label for="lg52hjq" class="commentText"><p>This was absolutely definitely a positive venture for WBD, the question for their CEO/board is could this money be invested in ways with a better return. They certainly werent making 10x blockbuster movie returns on the NBA. Also if you watch the NBA on TNT you’ll notice they heavily advertise their own shows, bring the stars of those shows to games and put them on TV etc. Maybe some channels convert viewers better through that etc. But to assume all of these partners are losing money is insane, everyone is making money. </p>

      <label for="lg539fa" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s being run at a loss when you consider the cable carriage fees and advertising on other programs. It&rsquo;s also a multi-year deal that would normally get more affordable due to inflation. Obviously not if cable TV dies off.</p>

<p>WBD is left with &lsquo;wrestling&rsquo;, hockey, baseball and the NCAA tourney. The NCAA is increasingly problematic I would guess given the chaos in college sports and a listless Congress more concerned with trolling on social media than governing.</p>

<p>IF the NBA doesn&rsquo;t work for bringing in viewers for other programs, I bet that the whole thing has to be blown up anyway. That&rsquo;s the whole business model that TNT relies on. If it doesn&rsquo;t work with NBA, I&rsquo;m not sure it works with hockey, baseball and NCAA either, even if they&rsquo;re more affordable. Because they&rsquo;re not bringing in new viewers.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to adjust for secular decline vs growth even at a deficit. The Barkley thing is a perfect example. You&rsquo;re losing assets just from the anticipation of loss, then you take the losses too. It projects out to zero instead of projecting growth with a question mark of affordability.</p>

<p>But of course I don&rsquo;t know their real situation, and this is only one part of a very large corporation now.</p>

      <label for="lg57cf7" class="commentText"><p>WWE got better since Vince left is part of it. I also think AEW expanding the amount of PPVs while keeping the same cost for each has been detrimental. I can get the WWE PPVs for $10 a month with a Peacock sub.</p>

<p>Also, it was June of last year that AEW added a 2nd live show a week, and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve adapted well at all. The storylines feel like they are spread way too thin. Simply put, they need to trim the fat on the roster and figure out who they want to push properly.</p>

<p>I also think Tony Khan is a bit like a kid getting toys. The moment he gets a new one, he forgets everything that&rsquo;s going on with his old one.</p>

      <label for="lg4ytme" class="commentText"><p>NBA has become a weird TV product. I can honestly say I’ve watched more episodes of Charles, Kenny, Shaq, and Ernie than I have regular season games over the past 3 years. Usually because stars seem to be load managing or “hurt” each time I decided to watch a regular season game on TNT. I can see why WBD/TNT did not want to pay in the exclusivity window.</p>

<p>But the NBA rules in social media conversation, highlights, clips, stat nerds, etc. Kids are die hard NBA fans. Know everything, have gear, etc. But they do not watch the regular season games live at all. Ratings show that not many are watching NBA regular season games live. But the world is following and posting, watching highlights and clips all in realtime. Just not watching the full regular season games live.</p>
