<p>It seems hard for me to believe WBD thinks they are going to prevail in a court case…</p>

<p>That means they must think they are going to get something else, and the only thing I can think of is they think they’re going to create enough consternation that they’re going to put lawyers in rooms and they [The NBA] will ask “what would you settle for,” and my guess is what they would settle for is money.</p>

<p>At one point, it occurred to me that they [WBD] might like to be relieved of their obligation to pay their <span class="math inline">\(1.2-1.3B in the upcoming season and let Amazon or NBC start early and that way Mr. Zaslav could say to his board, “Not only did I not overpay for 11 years of the NBA, I’m gonna save us \)</span>1B to $1.5B.”</p>

      <label for="lg4vc1s" class="commentText"><p>He’s not wrong. There’s no way with the ratings the NBA draws they were ever in the green with ad revenue. Rare case where public sentiment was completely at odds with business reality. Amazon of course can eat the losses because of other business sectors that let them take more risk.</p>

      <label for="lg4vohk" class="commentText"><p>Well, we know either way, games will not be shown on TNT after this upcoming season regardless. That ship has sailed. WBD has had their financial issues, revenues were already projected quite poorly and doing even worse than projections, so it&rsquo;s all conceivable. All these dudes care about truly is money anyway.</p>

      <label for="lg4wf3m" class="commentText"><p>Kinda hard to believe they re-upped with Chuck then only attempted to exercise their rights to match in order to get a payout. I listened to a bit of what you linked but I didn&rsquo;t hear anything about their reasoning around not believing the jury would not rule specific enforcement of the contract.</p>

      <label for="lg4xtmu" class="commentText"><p>11.4 million people watched the NBA finals last game. Monday Night Football draws an average crowd of 17.4 million. 202.4 million watched the Super Bowl.</p>

<p>They could start a professional wrestling league, pay 50 guys and some staff, and get basically the same ratings as they&rsquo;re losing with the NBA for 1/100th the price.</p>
