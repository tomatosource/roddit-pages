</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Basically if you look at the players who peaked the highest in every decade, which decade was the strongest? For peaks let’s say a 3 year stretch</p>

<p>This is how I would personally have the lists but there is some leeway (Barkely in 90s, Wade in 2000s, CP3 in 2010s, SGA in 2020s etc)</p>

<p><strong>2020s</strong>: Luka, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Tatum</p>

<p><strong>2010s</strong>: Lebron, Curry, KD, Harden, Kawhi</p>

<p><strong>2000s</strong>: Kobe Lebron Shaq Duncan KG</p>

<p><strong>1990s</strong>: Jordan, Hakeem, Shaq, Robinson, Malone</p>

<p><strong>1980s</strong>: Jordan, Magic, Bird, Kareem, Moses</p>

<p>Not gonna go past the 80s</p>

      <label for="lmtcjnt" class="commentText"><p>Something about seeing tatum on this list doesn&rsquo;t sit right with me. He has been a top 10 player in the 2020s but he&rsquo;s been more of a product of best player on the best team then him being individually the best player at any point I will concede he had been one of the more consistent and available of players especially when considering the players that would replace him. I do see him getting replaced in this exercise by someone like Wemby moving forward. Even Embiid can be potentially be replaced especially if he continues to see playoff failures.</p>

      <label for="lmtu2zn" class="commentText"><p>Embiid has definitively been a top 3 regular season player and I don&rsquo;t even know if tatum has even finished a season as a top 3 player. Embiid has shown me enough in the reg season to earn this spot and he has some some dominant playoff performances and some really poor ones.</p>

<p>Tatum I don&rsquo;t think has even had a top 5 regular season performance maybe he has one of the 2020s but rmr MVP voting and best players are two very distinct things. He&rsquo;s been part of some of the best rosters and a very good organization and that kind of stuff matters. If he played on the Hornets he would be viewed in a very different light. I do think he slots in as number 5 here as he is the most available and has been fairly consistent but others have peaked higher than him throughout the 2020s</p>

      <label for="lmtbhxs" class="commentText"><p>Look say what you want about the other eras, but the 80s was really just all about Magic and Bird. You can throw MJ there i guess, though 80s MJ honestly feels like Embid in a sense. Great player in the regular season, but not much success in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Kareem isnt particularly amazing in the 80s as its really more about Magic than Kareem when it comes to the Lakers (the 70s were when he was really at his best).</p>

<p>The 90s Robinson to me will always be both underrated and overrated. He got an MVp and all, but he has the same issue as Kareem had in the 80s. That of course being that another all time great was more notable on his team once they got drafted.</p>

<p>For the 2000s you could also argue Dirk or Dwade and hell even Nash. Honestly the 2000s is underrated for how stacked it actually was.</p>

<p>When you really look at the 2010s, it kinda feels like its very top heavy. Like there are a couple of guys that really stand out and then there is a significant drop that you dont see in the 2020s or 2000s.</p>

<p>Like i guess Westbrook, PG13 and Giannis are notable from that point and even Dirk for 2011, but it feels like it was really just all about these 5 guys mentioned on the post, with Lebron, KD and Steph standing out a lot more.</p>

<p>The 2020s havent finished yet so its a bit unfair. Parity makes it a lot less impressive as an era and injuries havent helped either. And somehow we have Tatum up there, which tells you that its too early to include the 2020s.</p>

<p>Jokic, Luka, Wemby, Giannis and SGA/Tatum if Embiid gets even more injured prone once the decade is over.</p>
