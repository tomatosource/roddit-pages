      <label for="lfj443m" class="commentText"><p>backstory: Chase Budinger was the number 1 ranked high school volleyball prospect in 2006 but chose to concentrate on basketball at Arizona in college. He was drafted by the pistons and traded to Rockets and played 7 NBA seasons with over 400 games as a bench player averaging 8/3/1 on 20mpg. He even competed in the 2012 dunk contest where he lost by only 1% of the vote.</p>

<p>He had a career earnings of $18mil and once he was out of the NBA in 2017 picked back up volleyball, this time as a beach volleyball player. He worked hard over the next 7 years and was able to snag a last minute spot on Team USA with his partner for the olympics. Their first game they faced off one of the top tanked teams and beat them handily.</p>

<p>With this match he became the first person to ever play in an NBA game and an Olympic Beach Volleyball match (and the first to win one of each).</p>

      <label for="lfli5oh" class="commentText"><p>Really doubt. Chase was the number 1 ranked vball prospect in high school so he already had a ton of vball skills and experience. And it still took him 7 years of training for beach vball to make it to the world stage, and while his team is good they likely are not going to dominate. If it took him that long despite already having an amazing vball background, there’s pretty much no chance an nba player could just pick it up and dominate.</p>

      <label for="lfljynb" class="commentText"><p>I mean.. think about what you’re saying.</p>

<p>The #1 HS Volleyball player was a bench guy in the NBA, then transitioned back to volleyball and made the Olympics in 7 years. As opposed to others who solely focused on making the Olympics and Chase made it over them.</p>

<p>I think any 6’6 + NBA starter could realistically transition to pro volleyball. Dominate? Idk. But I’m sure some could. Also, I’m more thinking of it from an indoor perspective (where they’d only have to be a wing or middle) because having to be able to set and deal with the space in beach would be too big of a gap for someone who didn’t grow up with volleyball.</p>

      <label for="lflm4jl" class="commentText"><p>The Olympics limits each country to two teams in beach volleyball, so basically it came down to who could get the most points in international tournaments between Budinger/Evans and another American team - Brunner/Crabb.  The other American team (Partain/Benesh) was well above either in points.  The points were counted as your best 12 finishes from tournaments over roughly the last 18 months.  Budinger/Evans got a bit of a late start in that 18 month period as they were starting with very low points (ie. for seeding) meaning they had to play qualifiers to even get into tournaments while Brunner/Crabb were well established and had plenty of points to go straight into the main draw of most tournaments.  Brunner/Crabb had a pretty large lead over Budinger/Evans coming into 2024 but played really poorly throughout this year while Budinger/Evans made steady improvement and put together a bunch of quality finishes this year including a couple of 5th place finishes in Elite16 (top-level) tournaments.  Budinger/Evans passed Brunner/Crabb in points a couple months ago with roughly 2 tournaments left in the qualifying period and Brunner/Crabb sucked in those last few tournaments and didn&rsquo;t gain anymore points, and basically they would have needed to have played WAY above their heads to have gained enough points to catch Budinger/Evans.  But it&rsquo;s safe to say Budinger/Evans were NOT the favorites to get the second American spot until just a few months ago.</p>

The team they played would not have qualified if not for the home team exception (rank 36 in the world), and will likely not win a set in this tournament, possibly not even get within 5 points (a very wide margin for beach volleyball).</p>

<p>This was a great game for them to get some nerves out and get a solid win, but the challenge definitely starts here.</p>

<p>But yeah it&rsquo;s probably an advantage to be taller but too tall and you probably aren&rsquo;t agile enough. I&rsquo;m not familiar enough with beach volleyball to be sure, but I would wager most NBA athletes are good at beach volleyball lol or can be.</p>

<p>Or even just volleyball heads really, I just assume you’re here cause you also like basketball.</p>

<p>Just how important is height in volleyball? Wilt seems to have made an impression there, my dumb view of the sport makes me think height is very good, as is jumping ability, as is lateral movement. So what’s the deal, would NBA players just kill it in volleyball or is there more going on?</p>

<p>edit: absolutely incredible answers below, learning about sports you’re largely clueless about is great, it’s why I dig the Olympics &amp;lt;3</p>

      <label for="lfjac4r" class="commentText"><p>Height is very important, as is jumping. All professional volleyball players who play front row have insane hops and are very tall. Most of the US roster who plays front row is about 6&rsquo;5 to 6&rsquo;7 and the middles are more like 6&rsquo;10 to 7&rsquo;</p>

<p>The reason Chase is so good is because he was actually THE best volleyball player in his entire class as a senior in high school. He has the skill background for volleyball and has now been playing it again for a full 7 years before making the olympic team (he did not make the Tokyo team). So I would say, no an NBA player could not come and dominate or even make a roster without at least a decade of experience in playing it like Chase did, but they do have a lot of similar skills and advantages that an NBA player could be a very good volleyball player with enough practice</p>

Height is important, but general athletic ability and skill are more important in beach volleyball. Usually you have one blocker (taller) and one defensive player. But both must be able to set and hit. Take regular volleyball, take away four players on each side, and clover the court with deep sand.</p>

I don’t know if it’s optimal in beach vball to have 1 player be super tall or if it’s worth it to be more like chases height with more mobility than a 7 footer since in beach vball they need to cover more ground and are more active.</p>

      <label for="lflnsn8" class="commentText"><p>Budinger at 6&rsquo;7&rdquo; is roughly average for a international professional beach volleyball blocker these days, maybe slightly on smaller side.  There are a few blockers 6&rsquo;11-7&rsquo;0 but most are 6&rsquo;7&rdquo;-6&rsquo;9&rdquo; with just a few down in the 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; range.  The defenders are mostly in the 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; to 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; range.  Back 15 years ago Phil Dalhausser was considered a huge blocker at 6&rsquo;9&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not really abnormal anymore.</p>

<p>Chase is on the very high end of volleyball skill though for a blocker, his setting hands are awesome for a blocker, he&rsquo;s a great passer (ie. serve receive), he&rsquo;s really good at hitting option balls ie. spiking the second contact instead of setting it for his partner to hit the 3rd contact which makes the opposing blocker have to stay near him until they&rsquo;re sure he&rsquo;s setting it which makes life easier on his partner.  Budinger&rsquo;s not just getting by on athleticism without skill, in fact if anything I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the opposite at this point.</p>

      <label for="lfjcivh" class="commentText"><p>Height is extremely important, but not everything. In beach volleyball there are two positions, defender and blocker.</p>

<p>Olympic level men’s defenders start around 6’0” and generally top out around 6’5” with most landing in the middle. The shorter defenders have outrageous verticals.</p>

<p>Blockers tend to start around 6’5” but most of the elite blockers are 6’7”-6’9” (Anders Mol 6’7”, Andy Benesh 6’9”). Jonathan Hellvig, one of the medal favorites, is a shockingly undersized blocker at 6’4” who makes up for it through a combination of skill and athleticism.</p>

<p>Basically, you need to be tall. If you can’t touch 11’ from a running start, you don’t have a shot at high level beach volleyball, simply because you need to be able to get over the blockers and open up angles on offense.</p>

<p>But, beach volleyball is interesting in that players peak in their late twenties early thirties, not at peak athleticism, because of the high skill component of the sport.</p>

<p>Would NBA players dominate? I tend to think so. But, there are definitely some athletic freaks like 6’11” Evandro from Brazil, who although great was never truly dominant (won one world championship and no Olympic medals). So it’s hard to say for sure.</p>

I will say though, this jump setting revolution is only possible in the last 5-10 years or so since they’ve been calling handsets less strictly to make a better viewing experiences for audiences. Before then, beach volleyball sets had to be so perfect that a jump setting offense would never have worked — by design, since the offense already has such a huge advantage.</p>

      <label for="lfjbpsi" class="commentText"><p>Depends.  If NBA players chose to play volleyball from a young age and have both the proper skill foundation and natural athleticism that allowed them to play in the nba?  The players 6’5 and up could definitely dominate.  Height is even more important in volleyball than it is in basketball, the small guards would have no chance.</p>

<p>If they had a few years or less to learn how to play  volleyball, and then try to compete at the highest level? Also no chance</p>

<p>I also think the athleticism at the highest level of volleyball is insanely underrated.  The most athletic volleyball players can touch over 12 feet.</p>

<p>My kmowledge is mostly of indoor volleyball however, I’m not sure about beach but my hunch is that skill matters more than height and athleticism for the beach game</p>

      <label for="lfjifpd" class="commentText"><p>You can see my answer below for some more beach volleyball-specific details, but most of this applies there as well. The biggest difference is the impact of the defender, who can be comparably “short” and still extremely successful through quickness, skill, and vision.</p>

<p>Some of the best defenders this Olympics IMO:</p>

<p>Ahmed Tijan QAT - 6’1”</p>

<p>David Åhman SWE - 6’2”</p>

<p>Christian Sørum NOR - 6’4”</p>

<p>Bartosz Łosiak POL - 6’3”</p>

<p>And many others but you get the point</p>

<p>That 6’1”-6’4” seems to be the sweet spot for defenders right now. I wonder if that’s partly just because of lack of extremely athletic tall people interested in beach volleyball though. Like would someone like Kuminga or Shaedon Sharpe make a dominant defender with their quickness and explosiveness at 6’6”+? Personally I think maybe because they can cover so much more court with their wingspan. But, it’s possible that having faster reflexes, absolute quickness, and instincts are more important, like how the best guard defenders even in the NBA tend to be guards themselves.</p>

      <label for="lfjausw" class="commentText"><p>I disagree that NBA players would dominate. Chase is a special case because he&rsquo;s had over a decade of high level volleyball experience. The players on team USA are all NBA height (6&rsquo;5 to 7&rsquo; range) and have massive hops too <a href="https://oss.jomh.org/files/article/20231030-124/pdf/JOMH2023032801.pdf" target="_blank">significantly higher on avg than NBA players</a>, but also the practice of 15+ years of playing competitive volleyball and honing those specific skills. NBA players would need to have dedicated volleyball practice for years like Chase did before having a shot at making a roster. Chase played high level vball for years, then after basketball has been practicing for another 7 years before he made the olympic team - he didn&rsquo;t make it in 2021.</p>

      <label for="lfkviad" class="commentText"><p>It should be noted that there are enough NBA players who do play beach volleyball from time to time to get a decent idea of the level of skill they&rsquo;re at. There&rsquo;s a great video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf_xM03EIqA" target="_blank">Luke Walton and Richard Jefferson playing a friendly with some AVP/Olympic level players</a> and it&rsquo;s painfully clear just how lacking they are in everything compared to the pros. Even playing 4v4 where defenders need to cover less of the court and attackers will have a better run at the ball, RJ and Walton are a step slow on defense and don&rsquo;t have consistent attacks like the AVP and Olympic guys do. It&rsquo;s also not like Walton and RJ are inexperienced at Volleyball either; they would run the court against 99% of players, just not these guys.</p>

      <label for="lfjclzo" class="commentText"><p>This is exactly what I’m wondering about.</p>

<p>I have a deep respect for expertise. I never like it when people posit these situations where one athlete can leap to another sport and instantly dominate. That can be the case if those sports are similar, but cross-sports?</p>

<p>I tend to think it can’t just be pure size and athleticism that makes Olympic-level volleyball players what they are unless skill and experience in the sport are minimal. To the extent it’s an Olympic sport, that seems impossible.</p>

      <label for="lfjdcic" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think you are pretty correct with your take. Volleyball is a very technically skilled sport, size and athleticism alone won&rsquo;t make you great. And yeah, sort of a unique case because Chase wasn&rsquo;t exactly just switching to a new sport and instantly dominating. He had a huge volleyball background and it still took him a full 7 years of training after his NBA career to make the olympic team.</p>

      <label for="lfjbm27" class="commentText"><p>Hmm really doubt it. Chase was THE number 1 player and has been back to playing beach vball for a full 7 years and only now made the olympic team. Outside of your anecdote, theres really nothing to show that. The people who make these national teams are also very physically gifted, with the same height and and higher vertical jump height of NBA players. Only they also have dozens of years more specific volleyball practice</p>

      <label for="lflcohb" class="commentText"><p>So I buy the general conclusion about the comparative leaping ability, but this study is kinda terrible? There&rsquo;s absolutely zero description about who the sample actually is - based on context clues (the study being done in a Chinese athletic testing facility) I&rsquo;m guessing that the college athletes in question are Chinese college volleyball players and Chinese college basketball players? I do think that likely complicates a good bit of the generalizability of the study - while people here have likely some idea of the processes that lead to athletes becoming DI basketball / volleyball players in the states, I at least have 0 idea how someone becomes a college athlete in China. Or even if college athletics are a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; there. If it&rsquo;s not competitive in the same way, or is in one sport but not the other, or one of a million other possibilities, the conclusions of this study might be radically different.</p>

Turns out college basketball players don’t jump as high as college vball players but you expect these same college basketball players to jump higher than pros??? Not like all the sudden the college vball players verticals are going to shrink by 4 inches when they turn pro. The significant advantage is still going to be there. Blocking you now since its clear you just want to argue and can&rsquo;t listen.</p>

However, a lot of the people I played with played both volleyball and basketball in HS. This isn&rsquo;t an either-or situation. Budinger is both a basketball player and volleyball player. Obviously if you want to turn athletics into a career, you choose the one that has the bigger payout.</p>

<p>The assertion that NBA players without any experience would dominate is wild though. While you can physically dominate in some plays, they would not automatically be a good receiving team. Volleyball isn&rsquo;t just about jumping at the net and swinging.</p>
