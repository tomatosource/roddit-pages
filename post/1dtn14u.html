Not to be flippant but it’s not like the version of him that was closing the season is who he has been during his NBA career, let alone the first half of last season.  I think it also sets a good precedent that nothing is given to the young guys in the organization but they’ll get their dues if they follow their expected timelines.  As a Houston fan I see no cause for concern here at the moment</p>

<p>Sengun not getting an extension definitely confused me more as I feel he’s solidified himself as their best player moving forward. The only justification I can see towards not giving it to him is his previous injury hampering his play moving forward. Doesn’t necessarily mean I agree with their decision though</p>

      <label for="lbaw2fm" class="commentText"><p>Senguns lower cap hold is also useful in free agency as they can open up a lot of space with declining FVV&rsquo;s TO. If they were gonna max him, you can wait till later, similar to what Philly did with Maxey. Green was picked 2 so his cap hold is like 30M+ similar to how Scottie Barnes had it, so if you think you&rsquo;re maxing him, no need to wait. Seems like Houston won&rsquo;t max him unless he really shows he&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p>Green has been too inconsistent. 40 mil to him could easily be an albatross. I see no reason why to make that decision early. Make him prove it.</p>

<p>He’s a fun player to watch but he’s not a guy you can win with at high stages with his flaws. He’s pretty much Sabonis 2.0</p>

<p>Edit: Srop comparing him to Jokic. You’re just setting yourself up for disappointment just like how not every decent 2 way wing with a raw jumper became Kawhi or MJ</p>

<p>For reference Sabonis was averaging 12-8-2 at that age, and Jokic averaged 17-10-5</p>

<p>Not saying he’s as good as Jokic, just trying to point out that he’s obviously not a finished product at 21</p>

      <label for="lbamtcu" class="commentText"><p>Tbf, the Rockets did just about everything they could to prevent Sengun from being a first option. They started Daniel Theis and Jaesean Tate instead of him his entire rookie year when it was clear he was the better player. His second year they tried to start Bruno Fernando over him so that KPJ could have a &ldquo;lob threat&rdquo;. They tried to sign Brook Lopez going into his third season but that thankfully fell through.</p>

<p>Sengun has just continued to prove his worth over and over again, and it took Ime all of 3 games to realize he was our best #1 offensive option this past season. He&rsquo;s put in the work to make these coaches realize he can be that type of player.</p>

Though as you stated in that limited time it was clear he was the best option (at the position and probably on the team).  Beyond that there’s something the coaches want to deny that the fans accepted and moving into this year I’m expecting we see some real traction on pushing him as one of, if not our de facto, star.”</p>

<p>Denver was <em>11</em> points better with Jokic on the court in his age 21 year, even though the other center on the team was Nurkic who&rsquo;s no slouch. Rockets were <em>better</em> with Sengun on the bench.</p>

      <label for="lbalfd0" class="commentText"><p>People who compare him to Jokic don’t actually watch the games. Sengun is nothing near the level of floor spacer that Jokic is. While they both have the ability to be the center point of an offense, the fact remains that you can’t muck up the spacing or kill pace when doing so, and Sengun does both of those while also being a poor defender. There’s an argument to be made that if he shoots more threes or gets a more consistent middy that maybe that narrative changes and that’ll reveal itself in time- but as things stand rn, he’s just an aesthetically pleasing player to watch but do I think he’s the best fit for how Ime runs the team and the guys we have on the roster? I’m not so sure about that.</p>

<p>If I’m stone I’m taking a good hard look at what Jalen looks like this season and then giving him the max if he shows improvement again because at the end of the day, you need someone who can score at will and Jalen is more likely to become that guy than Sengun is likely to become Jokic 2.0 at this point. I’ve always said Jalen is at his best when he’s with a big who can screen, roll to the rim, and be a lob threat, which is why I’m so excited to see how Steven Adam’s looks with us.</p>

<p>Imo Jalen, Cam, Amen, Tari and Jabari are the future of this team and any moves that are made should be to maximize their effectiveness</p>

      <label for="lbbfzfu" class="commentText"><p>To me the question isn&rsquo;t between Sengun or Green but Sengun or Amen.  Amen has zero range and Sengun is only good out to about the FT line.  They&rsquo;re both non shooting playmakers who can&rsquo;t draw out defenders or initiate outside of the paint.  We can&rsquo;t have two cornerstones of our roster with that same weakness.</p>

<p>On the flipside Jalen and Amen looked great out there together.  Part of why they both did so well that last month was because they had a strong two man game with Jalen initiating from the 3pt line and Amen in the dunker spot with nobody else in the paint.  Having Amen there for the bailout pass and cleaning up boards was huge.</p>

      <label for="lbakd5d" class="commentText"><p>Your first paragraph is just false. It&rsquo;s arguable that Silas wasn&rsquo;t high on Sengun. Maybe upper management told the coaching staff to prioritize Christian Wood to maximize his value on the trade market. Sengun is our most promising player but he was/is very young. They were being patient with him because Wood wasn&rsquo;t a part of their long term plans.</p>

<p>But if you watched last season, the organization is clearly high on him. Sengun was the offensive system for the team last year &ndash; mostly everything ran through him, which caused Jalen to struggle. Also, Brook Lopez was never going to replace Sengun. The team lacks size and they wanted to sign him as a floor spacing 7 footer, but Sengun was definitely not getting benched for Brook Lopez.</p>

<p>That would be Fred.</p>

<p>Ime went to SengÜn with the same regularity that Silas did at the end of his tenure. The difference was primarily having a PG that could actually run PnR effectively and looked for him more in the post&hellip;but the offense was FVV&rsquo;s to run.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if that continues this year. If it does, SengÜn may not cost as much to extend.</p>

Extending him now and you severely limit what kind of moves this team can make. This team as currently constructed will not be a contender, they need outside help, so leaving all avenues open to get that seems like a good idea.</p>

For a majority of last season, Jeff Green was our backup center.</p>

      <label for="lbb6wby" class="commentText"><p>Maxey didn’t get any extra for making an all star team (other than the $$$ players get for actually playing in the ASG. Think it’s like 100k). He was probably getting the full 25% max even if he was snubbed (assuming he still played well).</p>

<p>Making an all star team isn’t like making all-NBA or DPoY, which raises the 25% of the cap max to a potential 30% (if it happens before the extension kicks in, otherwise it stays at 25% plus raises, like Maxey’s will if he makes a future all NBA team).</p>

<p>E.g. if Scottie Barnes makes an all-NBA team next season, his extension will go up by like $40m. If he makes the ASG, nothing will happen (he can’t even have ASG incentives like some guys do, since he’s already getting extended at 25% of the max).</p>

      <label for="lbav0je" class="commentText"><p>It’s honestly the correct move. If your guy won’t rock the boat you may as well wait. Especially if they aren’t proven as Green really isn’t. Maximize flexibility next season and hope they continue to grow.</p>

<p>I’m a little surprised about Sengun not being extended because he seems to be the real deal. However, if he’s like Maxey and understands he’s gonna get his money it’s the best move for roster construction and will benefit him long term.</p>

      <label for="lbar2ye" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s a very different picture financially. The Sixers could do that and share a lot of confidence with Tyrese that he would be guaranteed every penny they could pay for him. Idk if I&rsquo;d have that level of trust as either Green or Alpi considering both have reportedly been in trade talks over the last couple years, and this is the exact sort of thing that chips away at relationships with young stars.</p>

Green OTOH knows he hasn&rsquo;t performed up to his #2 pick billing and this year&rsquo;s his last chance to prove he deserves a max. If he plays like the last 3 years and hits RFA I doubt he gets maxes from other teams anyway, and we would match any offers he gets if they&rsquo;re not too outrageous.</p>

      <label for="lbag1cx" class="commentText"><p>Sengun’s cap hold is only around $16 mil, due to him being drafted with the 16th pick. That number is a lot lower than a max extension number, which would hurt the Rockets&rsquo; flexibility in free agency next summer, which looks to be a potential point of focus as I don&rsquo;t see anything significant happening to our roster (we already have a packed roster, unless some trades happen). Green’s cap hold is a lot higher being a #2 pick but less than what an extension would entail.</p>

<p>There’s no politics, it&rsquo;s about flexibility next summer. Because Sengun was the 16th pick his cap hold is a lot lower than what is implied with the #2 overall pick in Green. Sengun’s cap hold number is a cheaper than a max extension if he were offered one now. Granted, this could blow up in their face next summer, but they&rsquo;re taking the risk. Both would end up being RFAs, so if there really is a demand for Sengun they should be on it ASAP.</p>

      <label for="lbak1vl" class="commentText"><p>Exactly.  If they decline FVV&rsquo;s team option and take both Green and Sengun to RFA before re-signing them, they&rsquo;d have more than enough cap space for a max player.  Signing Sengun especially to a max deal now makes little sense from a cap standpoint.  It risks hurting feelings, but the extra cap flexibility is huge.</p>

<p>The other thing to consider is that extending Sengun and not Green could also cause a potential rift in the locker room. So to avoid any potential locker room issues it&rsquo;s almost better to sign both or neither, but IMO Green hasn&rsquo;t shown he&rsquo;s worthy of a max at all right now so signing both is out of the question IMO.</p>

<p>For the FO, it&rsquo;s definitely best to just say we aren&rsquo;t extending either. It keeps flexibility for FA next year, is a pretty easy sell to the young guys, and helps avoid potential locker room issues (as best as possible)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how holding him on the books there is really gaining you any flexibility.

The Rockets are betting that either Green will take a huge leap forward and become a star this year worthy of a max deal, or they can sign him to a deal significantly short of his cap hold.  The quandry is if he remains pretty much the same player, capable of explosive games but inconsistent.</p>

      <label for="lbaf990" class="commentText"><p>I genuinely disagree with this. Centers ceilings are generally defined by their defense. People will mention Jokic in this, but Jokic both has dramatically improved on defense and is just a much larger man than Sengun. They went on a big run when Sengun got hurt which I think can be a bit misleading, but its much easier to build around a defensive center than an offensive one.</p>

<p>Guys like Lively in super simple roles as centers have tons of value and probably wont command the amount of money Sengun will.</p>

      <label for="lbal91i" class="commentText"><p>Definitely not. The stretch of schedule where they won 11 games was truly a cakewalk. And like the other guy said, Sengun was playing at the start of the win streak before his injury in Sacramento. I think they win all those games with Sengun handily.</p>

<p>I tend to believe people look at him as a pudgy white guy with an awkward gait and think he&rsquo;s bad defensively. He has good instincts and is usually in the right spots on the floor. He wasn&rsquo;t a bad defender for the Rockets by any stretch last season and his improvements on that end have been measurable relative to his rookie and sophomore seasons.</p>

<p>The true test for him will come when the Rockets are in the playoffs and he&rsquo;s being hunted on switches. The playoffs always expose a team&rsquo;s weak link defensively, but he is certainly no Enes Kanter.</p>

<p>This was Sengun&rsquo;s age-21 season. He put up 21/9/5</p>

<p>Jokic at 21 (turned 22 in February of this season): 17/10/5</p>

<p>From age 21 to the season when he turned 25 (so 4 seasons) Jokic gave you about 19/10/6.</p>

      <label for="lbawlt6" class="commentText"><p>I mean their analytics at the same age still show Jokic as a clearly much better player. Jokic was also playing behind Nurkic for quite a while and splitting minutes with him. He also always had the ability to shoot and stretch the floor which is an element of Senguns game which hasnt developed. There is a reason they arent maxing him.</p>

      <label for="lbag9uz" class="commentText"><p>His ceiling is limited by the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t have the body or athleticism to be a real lockdown paint protector or be able to switch and guard on the wing. And at least currently he can&rsquo;t shoot 3s well enough to make up for that defensive limitation. You could imagine a world where he develops a good 3 point shot which would be necessary for him to become a legit All-NBA type of player, but the defense is hard to change.</p>

Knicks never would have gotten OG if they didn&rsquo;t give RJ that rookie max extension despite the dubiousness of whether or not he deserves it. Teams will always value young players on long, controllable contracts especially when bird rights are part of the picture.</p>

<p>I don’t think they’re in a rush to throw money around on extensions just because everyone else is doing it. There’s also a chance that they feel like they could spend to upgrade those positions next offseason if Jalen Brunson and Evan Mobley hit free agency.</p>

<p>No thanks.  If I was him, I&rsquo;d probably bet on myself too. But if I was his agent, I might try to talk him into signing for something sub-max while people think that hot streak is possibly who he&rsquo;s gonna be. Because if he&rsquo;s losing minutes to Reed Sheppard and doesn&rsquo;t flash like that again, he&rsquo;s not getting anything close to a max.</p>

<p>His resume is slimmer than guys like Herro and Poole at the time of their extensions, and those guys got only. 19-20% of the cap (and immediately turned into bad contracts)</p>

<p>Which would make him Lavine 2.0. Those guys have value, but I&rsquo;d be wary of tying up a ton of cap into somebody who isn&rsquo;t a good defensive player or playmaker. Points are easier to find than people give them credit for (although it&rsquo;s nice to have somebody who can break down tough defenses in the playoffs)</p>

They&rsquo;re still going to see exactly where Sengun and Green takes them and they want to see more consistency out of Green before fully committing to this being their core. Rockets have a ton of space going into 2025 offseason&hellip;they&rsquo;re not looking to cut into that. 2025 is gonna be their inflection moment.</p>

<p>Seems like they sniffed for a superstar, were denied, and are now comfortable rolling with this roster, and continued internal growth, before putting all their chips in.</p>

<p>Rocket bros, don&rsquo;t talk yourself out of Sengun because he&rsquo;s currently not 100% as effective as Jokic. that&rsquo;s insane. get Sengun his Jamal Murray, an effective 2 man game partner that you can spam teams with and be your bread and butter.</p>

We were a top 5 defensive for a lot of the year before injuries hit with him at Center, and ended the season as a top 10 defense this year. And, that was just in our first year under Ime, with a lot of the roster being 20-22 year olds.</p>

<p>Sure, Sengun isn&rsquo;t going to be an elite defender, but I don&rsquo;t think he prevents you from building a good defense. This year proved that IMO</p>

      <label for="lbal3b4" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s in Maxey&rsquo;s position.  His cap hold going into free agency will be way lower than his expected salary, so it helps the team to give him a qualifying offer and ask him to be patient while the team makes other signings with the cap space first.</p>

<p>The other issue is that he&rsquo;s a negative on defense.  The Rockets tried signing Brook Lopez last summer and traded for Steven Adams at the trade deadline to see if they can re-create the Timberwolves double big strategy of offense/defense.</p>

      <label for="lbbo2gp" class="commentText"><p>Jalen Green is one of the most overrated young players in the league.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s essentially this generation&rsquo;s Rudy Gay or maybe a better comparison is Andrew Wiggins:  A guy who looks the part of a star player if your team is bad enough, but is at best a third-banana on a championship team.</p>

<p>People think they see potential, but he hasn&rsquo;t improved measurably since his rookie season.  He&rsquo;s going to be paid more than he&rsquo;s worth by a bad team or a team that&rsquo;s in an unattractive market just because they need someone who can plausibly appear to be That Guy.  But he isn&rsquo;t that guy.</p>

<p>I do wonder though, maybe with the new CBA there&rsquo;s not going to be a market to overpay him.  So maybe you could re-sign him to a reasonable contract, like 5-for-<span class="math inline">\(150m with a player option in Year 4.  (That's roughly in-line with Wiggins' GS contract, at \)</span>27m/year.)  Houston would avoid the overpay, and Green would be guaranteed his $150m but with the upside of if he blows up he can opt out and get more money in Year 4 if he&rsquo;s earned it.

<p>Sengun is great offensively but he’s not a two-way player. Green isn’t worth that much money. Sengun might get a Max that HOU will be forced to match but Green won’t get that from any team.</p>

<p>Green shows flashes, but I just feel like he’s not the starting two on the next great Rockets team.</p>

I do not get the idea of not maxing him. Maybe the injury is geared to he worse? How long will he be out of next season? All this chatter about their hesitation around Sengun as their star just makes me think they will fuck kt up somehow with an unforced error</p>

      <label for="lbb2bfn" class="commentText"><p>By waiting until he hits RFA to give him a max, they save like 25-30 mill in cap space next offseason, which will open a max slot if they also decline FVV&rsquo;s team option (they will).  Basically it gives them tons of space to work with next offseason and then they can exceed the cap to extend him.  It&rsquo;s really that simple.  Philly just did the same thing with Maxey and it allowed them to have a hugely successful free agency period.</p>
