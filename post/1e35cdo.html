      <p>Don’t mistake this for a late bloomer (like a ‘draft bust’ finding his way into a nice career); the player has be atleast 30 years old, clearly over the hill, only to then still have a couple better years.</p>

<p>The only ones I could think of rn are Brook Lopez after his miraculous back surgery and Nic Batum on the Clippers after his mediocre Hornets stint</p>

      <label for="ld6a5pd" class="commentText"><p>i’m a trainer and in my time learning about athletic training, i don’t think any league squandered the talent of more athletes than the nba, just off of the basis of having bad training. The best athletes play in the nba, but i’ve heard and seen training that i would describe as high school level until more recently and i’d even argue it had gone backwards until the last 5-10 years. I was watching Anthony Edwards train and you can see they’re going back to more olympic track and field styled training. I’ve literally seen videos of nba players training in the most embarrassing way for the caliber of athlete and salary - look up D’aaron Fox training with the kings from like 10 years ago and you’ll see how he looks like a fucking middle schooler - and i’ve seen videos from the mid 20th century of athletes going through much more effective training programs focused on the basics and you can just see the functional strength in action and those guys had insane verticals and speed like any other human in history. That training prevented injury and those guys were explosive and strong and tough as fuck.</p>

He shot 35% on 4.2 attempts with Philly, then shot 37% on 5.4 attempts after we traded him, despite playing less minutes.</p>

<p>The things you mentioned were part of it, but it was mainly so that CP0 could stop pulling a hamstring every playoff run. And tbf, he did get 3 largely healthy playoff runs out of it before he got injured again in <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.</p>

<p>had five pretty underwhelming seasons</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;First&rdquo; underwhelming season - was out with the ACL injury</li>
<li>&ldquo;Second&rdquo; - missed but all the final 6 games because of the same injury.</li>
<li>Third (87-88) - first with Washington, averaged 17 PPG bouncing between starter and 6th man</li>
<li>Fourth (88-89) - Almost 21 PPG</li>
<li>Fifth (89-90) - 22 PPG</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in 88-89 and 89-90 he was essentially sharing the scoring load with Jeff Malone, who put pretty similar numbers at the 2.</p>

<p>I can give you 87-88 as &ldquo;underwhelming&rdquo; to a degree but coming back from a shredded ACL in those days was way harder than today and doing 17 PPG given that is pretty good. The other two prior (because of injury) can&rsquo;t really count in that.</p>

      <label for="ld62s27" class="commentText"><p>2019-20 Dwight finally accepted the role he should&rsquo;ve been playing ever since he hurt his back. It&rsquo;s crazy how right Kobe was when he told 2012-13 Dwight to become &ldquo;his Tyson Chandler&rdquo;</p>

<p>For his next several teams, he would refuse to be a screener and instead spent all his time blowing up offensive possessions to post up and fail at being a point center. Houston/Atlanta/Charlotte Dwight was essentially Hassan Whiteside with a bigger name attached to it. Big stats, absolutely dominant on the occasion he did play the right away, but often impact-less or an outright liability because he did all the wrong things.</p>

<p>Then LeBron finally got through to him. It was a little too late for him athletically, but they still won.</p>

Then he had that 50 point game, got a multiyear deal, and was eventually nominated for 6th man of the year. Looks like he is going to retire on his own terms which is huge after everything he went through.</p>

      <label for="ld5jpro" class="commentText"><p>Tim Duncan in 2010-2011 averaged like 5 less ppg than the year prior and had a pretty mediocre playoff series when Spurs got upset by the 8th seed. 2 years later he was back to averaging 18ppg and would&rsquo;ve won Finals MVP if Ray Allen doesn&rsquo;t hit that shot in Game 6</p>

      <label for="ld5x65p" class="commentText"><p>Danny Green in game 7 was abysmal. Worse than the stats say even. In a tight game he went 1 for 12 for 5 points and had a couple of absolutely brutal turnovers. That&rsquo;s after going just 1 of 7 in game 6, and when your only role on offense is to shoot that&rsquo;s not great. Total of 2 for 19 for 8 points over the last 2 games. Was having a great series up until those final 2 games.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the non-superstar stuff that tends to get lost in the shuffle in these big playoff series. Kind of like Tristan Thompson in the 15-16 Warriors Cavs finals. He was huge on the boards for them and scored a lot of putbacks. A perfect <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> from the field over the last 2 games. Was a big difference maker in some tight games.</p>

Altho he still put 15ppg + per year in his New Orleans years, he was widely regarded as a total mistake and a low ceiling player. He bounced back in Houston and was a key piece of those conference finals rockets, and has been in demand ever since as a capable bench vet.</p>

<p>Also, JAVALE McGee for sure.</p>

Bill Walton won the finals and followed that up winning the MVP the next year even though he only was able to play 60 games. He only played 169 games for the next 6 years with the Clippers before going to Boston. He played 80 games with the Celtics his first year there and won the title as a sixth man before only playing ten more games in the next two years and hanging it up</p>

<p>Edit: realized he wasn’t 30+ during any of these seasons, but still think he’s an interesting example.</p>

      <label for="ld67k36" class="commentText"><p>I mean, you could make a case for Carmelo, when he realized that he wasn&rsquo;t great anymore and settled into being a situation shooter. But there are probably dozens examples of that kind of thing, a star who is no longer a star but figures it out, adjusts his game, and finds way to still contribute.</p>

<p>I never felt like Nic Batum was washed in Charlotte. I always felt like he was a good complementary player who was battling injuries and was miscast as a lead-scorer type.</p>
