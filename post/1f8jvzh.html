      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f8jvzh/what_will_be_a_hypothetical_talent_and_fit_based/"><p>What will be a hypothetical talent AND fit based equivalent of the KD Warriors death lineup (Hamptons 5) today?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The Hamptons 5 was THE best closing lineup in NBA history for any team ever: Steph, Klay, Iguodala, KD, Draymond. They relied on small ball with Draymond at the 5. All 5 could shoot and/or pass at a very high level. What would be the equivalent of this lineup in the NBA today based on talent and fit (so no Jokic for example as he is too big for a small ball lineup as he is a true center)?</p>

The purpose of small ball is to field an entire team of players who have ball handling and three point shooting capability. So, no reason to exclude Jokic.

      <label for="llf4ezd" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re conflating a lot of things that happened at the same time, and it&rsquo;s confusing you.</p>

<p>Teams started playing small ball to maximize speed, agility and shooting ability on offense, as well as to open lanes. It was an <em>offensive</em> decision, with known sacrifices that came with the defense as well as the offense. That&rsquo;s what lead to the absolutely stunning implosion of Mike Ds Rockets.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as &ldquo;small ball defense&rdquo; as a concept, some teams have just figured out ways to make it work, mainly by having multiple players who can switch easily if need be.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s changed in a massive way since 2014 is the evolution of the modern big man. They&rsquo;re now asked to handle the ball, pass, and be a threat from any space on the floor, including threes. Most bigs today grew up under pace and space philosophy, and as such, they&rsquo;ve learned to anticipate plays well enough to make up for lack of lateral movement or agility. Jokic would not be much less effective than 2014 Dray on defense, but hed be infinitely more effective on offense.</p>

      <label for="llfft6z" class="commentText"><p>You’re both right and wrong imho. Small ball is about both offense and defense. First and foremost it’s about speed and mobility on offense, for it to work, it requires shooting, ball handling and playmaking by all 5 or at least 4 of the guys. Remember, that towards the end, neither Dray nor Iggy shot it particularly well from outside. And on defense it IS about switchability. It was fairly novel for the Warriors to start switching as much as they did, as teams were used to defenders fighting through or going under screens. And I hope you don’t mean it when you say that Joker would not be a step down on defense from the generational defender in Draymond. His help defense, ability to guard 5s as well as switch onto smaller guards is pretty unique. Warriors were a dynasty because they were elite on both offense and defense. It was talked about a lot, how their defense lead to a lot of transition offense, where Steph or Klay would just get open shots from outside, before the defense got set.</p>

      <label for="llfgkip" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re so close to getting it, but you&rsquo;re missing a couple of key things.</p>

<p>Switchability and height are not inversely correlated. You can be shorter and not able to switch well, or you can be taller and pretty versatile on switches. Like, Wemby can defend four positions pretty well, even five against many teams. You wouldn&rsquo;t have to bench him in a small ball lineup. You&rsquo;re trying to be switchable, you&rsquo;re not literally trying to be short.</p>

<p>And yes, I absolutely believe Jokic would only be a little less effective than Dray on defense. Not by enough to offset the offensive difference. As I was saying earlier, big men have evolved. The ones who are 30 or younger had to grow up in the pace and space era, so the really good ones have learned how to switch really well. Not by any increased mobility or lateral movement, but by anticipating. Prime Dray had way more lateral movement ability and agility than Joker, no doubt. But Joker is ten times more intelligent than Dray. Hell know exactly where to be, so far in advance that he doesn&rsquo;t have to be as quick.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised more people don&rsquo;t know this, but Joker has become one of the better defensive centers in the NBA.</p>

<p>Defensively, Kings fans better gear up for some real high scoring games. Hampton 5 worked because outside of Steph all of them were good/great defenders, and even Steph was great at getting steals and playing within their defensive system. Not only am I not high on a defensive backcourt of Fox and Monk, but Sabonis as your backup rim protection leaves alot to be desired.</p>

<p>That being said, they might just shoot alot of teams out the gym so who cares about defence</p>

<p>What would be the equivalent of this lineup in the NBA today based on talent and fit (so no Jokic for example as he is too big for a small ball lineup as he is a true center)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a misconception of what a small ball lineup is. First of all, if you just count height I think KD and Jokic are around the same. Second and most importantly, the small ball lineup was/is played to have shooters and passers in all 5 positions, not to have short guys. On top of that all 5 guys should be quick enough relative to piers and still doesn&rsquo;t have to suffer from mistmatches, with &ldquo;fake&rdquo; smalls (KD Draymond could defend on bigs). That&rsquo;s why 2020 Houston extrasmall didn&rsquo;t worked as well as other small ball lineups.</p>

      <label for="llfpb0x" class="commentText"><p>Feel like using Steph or KD again is cheating so here&rsquo;s what I would go with:</p>

<p>Tyrese Maxey - scoring guard who can shoot the 3 like Curry</p>

<p>Devin Booker - another scoring threat but who&rsquo;s shown great defensive abilities lately (Olympics was a good test run of Booker in a Klay like role)</p>

<p>Anthony Edwards - this is the biggest stretch for sure, but Ant playing the Iggy role as a hyper athletic defensive  presence</p>

<p>Jayson Tatum - Tatum for his switchability, he&rsquo;s shown he can guard at least 4 positions this year</p>

<p>Bam Adebayo</p>

      <label for="llfv6bj" class="commentText"><p>Bam: what Draymond brought to the death lineup was excellent defense on centers and on switches, combined with good passing. Bam can do even more than that (showed flashes of extended range in the Olympics).</p>

<p>LeBron: KD was a really impactful defender and rim protector, adding excellent shooting and no real need to gave the ball in his hands. While KD is still performing at an insanely high level, he&rsquo;s not the defender he once was, but most importantly lost most of his rim pressure ability. In the last years we saw LeBron have the ball in his hands less and less, and still be crazy efficient. The shooting improvement, ability to defend 3-5 and rim pressure make him a good candidate.</p>

<p>Kawhi: Iguodala was a great defender, able to switch multiple positions. Didn&rsquo;t really need the ball too much but was an above average shooter and good playmaker. Kawhi has made huge strides in that sense, and still remains a premier defender when (much like LeBron) his offensive load is reduced. Plus, Kawhi is also a Max Kellerman favourite.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown: JB might not be the shooter Klay is (hardly a knock on him) but is really good and will replicate the stellar defense on the perimeter and the cutting Klay provided. Can really work in a motion offense, he doesn&rsquo;t need to dribble too much (Klay famously didn&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>Steph: Steph still does 99% of what his 2017 version did, almost impossible to replace.</p>

The 2017-19 Warriors especially 2017 are just the super team&rsquo;s final bosses. The Third Option can give you 60-plus with 13 dribbles the hell???. The 7th man Shaun L. Lets be honest have your ever seen him miss a mid-range shot during that 2017 run…</p>

<p>Book/Ant (Klay replacement)</p>

<p>KD</p>

<p>LeBron (Iggy replacement)</p>

<p>Bam (Draymond replacement)</p>

<p>The replacements are better than the OG counter part so let&rsquo;s scale things down</p>

<p>SG: Trey Murphy</p>

<p>Iggy: DeAndre Hunter, Dejounte Murray</p>

<p>Draymond: Only Bam</p>

<p>Hard to find a Draymond counterpart. Defensive playmaker. Undersized but switchable.</p>

      <label for="llf5d0a" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re making the same mistake OP is.</p>

<p>What made Dray valuable to that defense was his switchability, <em>not</em> his lack of size. If he was just as switchable but a couple of inches taller, like say Bam or Wemby, that would have made him even better.</p>

<p>I think what&rsquo;s throwing people is the idea that &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; automatically means more switchable. In point of fact, it doesn&rsquo;t. Big men have evolved since 2014. Today we have guys who can switch every bit as well as Dray, they just happen to be traditionally sized centers.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like if you saw Mugsy Bogues on offense and thought wow, this tiny PG offense is awesome! Who could do this today in 2000? And then someone said Iverson? And you then say no, Iverson is too tall for the tiny PG offense! You&rsquo;re missing the same point. Iverson can do all the same things Mugsy could do, he&rsquo;s just also seven inches taller.</p>
