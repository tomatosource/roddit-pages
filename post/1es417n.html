</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>I posted this in the Celtics sub yesterday and a friend suggested I repost here. I had some downtime at work the last few weeks and decided to put together a spreadsheet of players who won championships and were also all-stars. I have a working list of players in my personal NBA hall of fame and since many of the guys on my list got there by winning championships I was curious as to whether there were any forgotten all-star seasons that led to championships we don&rsquo;t talk about.</p>

<p>You can find the link here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12FNEDnRyF561BpIfXqG2LOBypLY4NDDQHE7kFcAw2hI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12FNEDnRyF561BpIfXqG2LOBypLY4NDDQHE7kFcAw2hI/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>Key Takeaways:</p>

<ol>
<li>There have been 177 different players to be an all-star and win a championship at some point in their career. This is ~39% of the total unique all-stars in history which is 454 (does not include ABA)</li>
<li>There have been 81 players to be an all-star the same year that they won a championship</li>
<li>38 have done it twice, 22 three times, 13 four times, 9 five times, 5 six times, and 1 ten times</li>
<li>Of players to do it at least twice, only 3 are not in my personal hall of fame (Mark Aguirre, Slater Martin, and Jim Pollard)</li>
</ol>

<p>Most Interesting One-Timers (1955-current and not yet in my personal Hall of Fame)</p>

<ol>
<li>Andrew Wiggins (2022 - 17/5/2 on 47% and 39%3)</li>
<li>Manu Ginobili (2005 - 16/4/4 on 47% and 38%3)</li>
<li>Andrew Toney (1983 - 20/3/4.5 on 50% and 29%3)</li>
<li>Mo Cheeks (1983 - 12.5/3/7 on 54%)</li>
<li>Norm Nixon (1985 - 17/3/9 on 46.5% and 33%3)</li>
<li>Maurice Lucas (1977 - 20/11/3 on 47%)</li>
<li>Bill Bradley (1973 - 16/4/4.5 on 46%)</li>
<li>Chet Walker (1967 - 19/8/2 on 49%)</li>
<li>Jack George (1956 - 14/4/6 on 37%)</li>
<li>Neil Johnston (1956 - <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> on 46%)</li>
<li>Paul Seymour (1955 - 14.5/4/7 on 36%)</li>
</ol>

<p>Notable players who did not meet the criteria<br>
1-2) Horace Grant, Andre Iguodala (4 championships, 1 all-star appearance)</p>

<ol>
<li>David Robinson (2 championships, 10 all-stars)<br>
4-5) Clyde Drexler, Jason Kidd (1 championship, 10 all-stars)<br>
6-7) Dwight Howard, Kyrie Irving (1 championship, 8 all-stars)<br>
8-10) Ed Macauley, Jerry Lucas, Alonzo Mourning (1 championship, 7 all-stars)<br>
</li>
<li>Bob McAdoo (1xMVP 2x Champ, 5x All-Star)<br>
</li>
<li>Gary Payton (1x champ, 9x All-Star)</li>
</ol>

      <label for="li3s0fi" class="commentText"><p>He would have been an All Star in 1999 but they cancelled the game. The Spurs record and his overall impact would have made him one. He made the All Star game in 1998, 2000, and 2001, so no reason to think he misses it in 1999. They also took multiple Cs back then when it was its own position, which is how Jamaal Magloire even made an All Star a few years later. </p>

      <label for="li38pd9" class="commentText"><p>The biggest difference IMO was he started rebounding really really good those playoffs.</p>

<p>His career high in rebounds was 11, and then he had a 16 rebound game and a 13 rebound game in the finals. His rebounding average was 4.5 for the season and 7.5 for the playoffs (8.8 for the finals).</p>

<p>When the dude locked in, he was just putting in more effort and it made his defence and his rebounding significantly improve.</p>

      <label for="li3xop7" class="commentText"><p>lol I&rsquo;m surprised at how focused people are about that. I&rsquo;ll need to think more about it. His 2 all-stars, 2 all-nba 3rd teams, and only 2 seasons averaging 30mpg would be close to the fewest accolades on the list (because it&rsquo;s only for NBA-related achievements).</p>

<p>But, he has multiple iconic plays (the block on Harden being my fave), has 4 championships, has incredible postseason stats, was a key player on my second-favorite team of the last fifteen years, and is just generally a cool guy.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s close, but I need more time to think about it. Kevin Johnson is close to the bottom of my list and he has 4 all-nba second team selections, but no championships. Was Manu better than him? I honestly have no idea. Championships are more important, but I&rsquo;m also not putting Horry, KC Jones, or Ron Harper on my list. I think Manu is better than all three of those guys, but I don&rsquo;t know how to compare him to guys who were 1st or 2nd options on great teams.</p>

<p>I love him though so I could see myself being swayed to get him in pretty soon!</p>

<p>He led I think the only team in existence that wasn’t the USA to a gold medal in the Olympics, beating USA in the process. That is pretty huge, because it just doesn’t happen</p>

<p>Also, I’m not saying he should be number one or anything crazy like that, but like if a personal hall of fame has like 50 or 100 players , he needs to be on it 😂</p>

<p>So he missed a significant portion of games and was averaging 19-3-4 on 54.4% TS by the time of the All-Star game. Not too surprising that he didn’t make it that year.</p>

      <label for="li3p999" class="commentText"><p>Tim Duncan needs to be updated for 1999, he was only not an All-Star because the game was cancelled due to the lockout.  He was first team all-nba, same thing for 1949 &amp; 1950 George Mikan (there just wasn’t an All-Star game, but he was first team).</p>

<p>David Robinson was also All-Star Calibar in 1999.</p>

      <label for="li3urop" class="commentText"><p>That is a good point I had forgotten about that. It&rsquo;s hard to speculate who would have been on the team so I won&rsquo;t include Robinson since he wasn&rsquo;t All-NBA, but I think Duncan being on the first team is enough to give him an extra one. Good catch!</p>
