</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>I posted this in the Celtics sub yesterday and a friend suggested I repost here. I had some downtime at work the last few weeks and decided to put together a spreadsheet of players who won championships and were also all-stars. I have a working list of players in my personal NBA hall of fame and since many of the guys on my list got there by winning championships I was curious as to whether there were any forgotten all-star seasons that led to championships we don&rsquo;t talk about.</p>

<p>You can find the link here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12FNEDnRyF561BpIfXqG2LOBypLY4NDDQHE7kFcAw2hI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12FNEDnRyF561BpIfXqG2LOBypLY4NDDQHE7kFcAw2hI/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>Key Takeaways:</p>

<ol>
<li>There have been 177 different players to be an all-star and win a championship at some point in their career. This is ~39% of the total unique all-stars in history which is 454 (does not include ABA)</li>
<li>There have been 81 players to be an all-star the same year that they won a championship</li>
<li>38 have done it twice, 22 three times, 13 four times, 9 five times, 5 six times, and 1 ten times</li>
<li>Of players to do it at least twice, only 3 are not in my personal hall of fame (Mark Aguirre, Slater Martin, and Jim Pollard)</li>
</ol>

<p>Most Interesting One-Timers (1955-current and not yet in my personal Hall of Fame)</p>

<ol>
<li>Andrew Wiggins (2022 - 17/5/2 on 47% and 39%3)</li>
<li>Manu Ginobili (2005 - 16/4/4 on 47% and 38%3)</li>
<li>Andrew Toney (1983 - 20/3/4.5 on 50% and 29%3)</li>
<li>Mo Cheeks (1983 - 12.5/3/7 on 54%)</li>
<li>Norm Nixon (1985 - 17/3/9 on 46.5% and 33%3)</li>
<li>Maurice Lucas (1977 - 20/11/3 on 47%)</li>
<li>Bill Bradley (1973 - 16/4/4.5 on 46%)</li>
<li>Chet Walker (1967 - 19/8/2 on 49%)</li>
<li>Jack George (1956 - 14/4/6 on 37%)</li>
<li>Neil Johnston (1956 - <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> on 46%)</li>
<li>Paul Seymour (1955 - 14.5/4/7 on 36%)</li>
</ol>

<p>Notable players who did not meet the criteria<br>
1-2) Horace Grant, Andre Iguodala (4 championships, 1 all-star appearance)</p>

<ol>
<li>David Robinson (2 championships, 10 all-stars)<br>
4-5) Clyde Drexler, Jason Kidd (1 championship, 10 all-stars)<br>
6-7) Dwight Howard, Kyrie Irving (1 championship, 8 all-stars)<br>
8-10) Ed Macauley, Jerry Lucas, Alonzo Mourning (1 championship, 7 all-stars)<br>
</li>
<li>Bob McAdoo (1xMVP 2x Champ, 5x All-Star)<br>
</li>
<li>Gary Payton (1x champ, 9x All-Star)</li>
</ol>

      <label for="li3s0fi" class="commentText"><p>He would have been an All Star in 1999 but they cancelled the game. The Spurs record and his overall impact would have made him one. He made the All Star game in 1998, 2000, and 2001, so no reason to think he misses it in 1999. They also took multiple Cs back then when it was its own position, which is how Jamaal Magloire even made an All Star a few years later. </p>

      <label for="li3xop7" class="commentText"><p>lol I&rsquo;m surprised at how focused people are about that. I&rsquo;ll need to think more about it. His 2 all-stars, 2 all-nba 3rd teams, and only 2 seasons averaging 30mpg would be close to the fewest accolades on the list (because it&rsquo;s only for NBA-related achievements).</p>

<p>But, he has multiple iconic plays (the block on Harden being my fave), has 4 championships, has incredible postseason stats, was a key player on my second-favorite team of the last fifteen years, and is just generally a cool guy.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s close, but I need more time to think about it. Kevin Johnson is close to the bottom of my list and he has 4 all-nba second team selections, but no championships. Was Manu better than him? I honestly have no idea. Championships are more important, but I&rsquo;m also not putting Horry, KC Jones, or Ron Harper on my list. I think Manu is better than all three of those guys, but I don&rsquo;t know how to compare him to guys who were 1st or 2nd options on great teams.</p>

<p>I love him though so I could see myself being swayed to get him in pretty soon!</p>

<p>He led I think the only team in existence that wasn’t the USA to a gold medal in the Olympics, beating USA in the process. That is pretty huge, because it just doesn’t happen</p>

<p>Also, I’m not saying he should be number one or anything crazy like that, but like if a personal hall of fame has like 50 or 100 players , he needs to be on it 😂</p>

His offense with Golden State has (had been up until 2024) slightly more efficient but not out of line with the rest of his career. The change was a commitment to defense. Last year was not a regression to the mean.  It was by far the worst season of his career.</p>

      <label for="li38pd9" class="commentText"><p>The biggest difference IMO was he started rebounding really really good those playoffs.</p>

<p>His career high in rebounds was 11, and then he had a 16 rebound game and a 13 rebound game in the finals. His rebounding average was 4.5 for the season and 7.5 for the playoffs (8.8 for the finals).</p>

<p>When the dude locked in, he was just putting in more effort and it made his defence and his rebounding significantly improve.</p>

      <label for="li6p5nj" class="commentText"><p>Great question! I was able to find a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kevin Love who was an all-star the next season and had been one two years previous on Minny<br>
</li>
<li>Kyrie Irving made it both the previous and following years, though he missed it probably due to injury. Same with Khris Middleton in &lsquo;21.<br>
</li>
<li>Clyde Drexler made it the following year, but not the previous year<br>
</li>
<li>Kind of a stretch, but Paul Westphal won in &lsquo;74 as a roleplayer, moved to PHX in &lsquo;76 where he lead the team to the finals, and then had 5 straight all-star appearances after that<br>
</li>
<li>Billy Cunningham was a key player with Wilt on the &lsquo;67 champs but wouldn&rsquo;t be an all-star until &lsquo;69-&lsquo;73<br>
</li>
<li>Siakam was an all-star the year after he won, same with Bob Dandridge after &lsquo;78<br>
</li>
<li>Jamaal Wilkes is probably the funniest. Won in &lsquo;75 as a rookie and all-star the next year. Won in &lsquo;80 and all-star the next year. Won in &lsquo;82 and all-star the next year.</li>
</ol>

<p>My personal favorite is Jrue being traded after his all-star appearance in &lsquo;23 and then winning in &lsquo;24 but I&rsquo;m biased (also I think Lopez should have been the all-star that year anyway)</p>

      <label for="li7fzce" class="commentText"><p>Wow, that&rsquo;s way more instances than I was able to find, especially the Jamaal Wilkes double occurrence. Here are a few more that I found:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Tim Duncan</strong> (2 occurrences of sandwiched AS/Title/AS season sequences, though the first one was on a technicality):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>First occurrence</strong> (&lsquo;98–&rsquo;00):

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;98 All-Star (Rookie, All-NBA 1st)</li>
<li>&lsquo;99 Title (No All-Star game due to the lockout, but still All-NBA 1st)</li>
<li>&lsquo;00 All-Star (All-NBA 1st)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Second occurrence</strong> (&lsquo;13–&rsquo;15):

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;13 All-Star (All-NBA 1st)</li>
<li>&lsquo;14 Title (Old)</li>
<li>&lsquo;15 All-Star (Penultimate season, All-NBA 3rd)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Paul Pierce</strong> (&lsquo;08–&rsquo;09):</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;08 Title</li>
<li>&lsquo;09 All-Star (Injured from around Christmas until just before the All-Star Game, but was still selected)</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Jason Kidd</strong> (&lsquo;10–&rsquo;11):</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;10 All-Star (Replacement selection, so kind of a stretch)</li>
<li>&lsquo;11 Title</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I guess even more narrowing it down next to more critical players would be looking at All-NBA selections probably? Since that would limit the pool even more.</p>

It&rsquo;s pretty wild looking at his basketball reference page. Not many guys have gone from total non-shooter to knockdown from long-range the way he did. I wonder what his career arc would look like if he played in today&rsquo;s NBA. Would he be more efficient? Would he pass less? Would he be the best PG in the league?</p>

      <label for="li4u21l" class="commentText"><p>interesting but I imagine most championship winners / leaders on the team would be an all star. like Tatum, etc. pretty much no matter who won the team would have an all star. it&rsquo;s linked with team success.</p>

<p>the more interesting question might be, championship teams <em>without</em> an all star or the least all stars (at the time of them winning the ring)</p>

      <label for="li6mv63" class="commentText"><p>At the time, the 2004 Pistons only had one all star, Ben Wallace, who had 2 appearances. Rasheed Wallace also had 2 all star appearances but the most recent had been in &lsquo;01.</p>

<p>Both of them went on to have 2 more appearances, and Rip Hamilton and Chauncey Billups also became all stars after getting a ring.</p>

<p>Jokic&rsquo;s ring with the Nuggets will also be up there, I think he&rsquo;s the only one on the team yo make an all star appearance.</p>

      <label for="li77kn3" class="commentText"><p>that makes a lot more sense! or, feels more notable! so since 1960 even, I doubt there&rsquo;s been a team without an all star to win a chip. maybe without an all nba player though.</p>

<p>e: 89 pistons were the only one since the third team was added to win a chip without an all nba player.</p>
