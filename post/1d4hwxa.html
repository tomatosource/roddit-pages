<p>Another thing is that if parents kind of suck at chores/are overwhelmed by chores, it can be really hard for them to properly teach kids and not get weird emotions all tied up in it. So really there’s a lot going on here other than chores = success.</p>

Perhaps this is a very effective manner of mopping, but who has that kind of time? Not to mention it’s hard on the knees and back. But if you don’t do it that way, you’re lazy and your house is dirty. Can’t win. Luckily I own my own home now so her asinine mopping rules don’t apply to me anymore.</p>

<p>My father loved to repair things in the garage, whenever he had a problem he would call me and ask me &ldquo;How would you solve this?&rdquo; then he would encourage me to come up with creative solutions and we would thinker it together, 30 years later and working as a software engineer I love solving problem and encouraging people to work on their ideas.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/can-the-remote-work-era-fix-how-scientists-study-kids/ar-BB1ikzWg" target="_blank">A Paradigm Shift in How Scientists Study Kids by Connie Chang | 15 Feb 2024</a></p>

<p>WEIRD</p>

<p>There is an open secret in the study of child development: Most of what we think we know about how babies develop is actually based on a specific subset of kids—those born to families from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (a.k.a. WEIRD) nations.</p>

<p>The acronym was first coined in an influential 2010 paper to describe the wildly unrepresentative populations that many psychology studies have long relied on. This is an issue in the field generally, and certainly a thorny problem in developmental psychology, which primarily studies children: According to one paper, WEIRD subjects make up 96 percent of the data used in published developmental-science studies but represent only 12 percent of the world’s population.</p>

<p>As a result, it’s hard to be certain whether many things we think we know about babies’ development are truly universal elements of human nature. It means that we tell an incomplete story about the process of our own becoming. Yet the problem has remained hard to fix. Even within the U.S., similar demographic biases have arisen: The families that most often participate in research studies tend to be white, affluent, and highly educated. The type of parent who brings their baby to a study typically lives near a university, many of which are located in cities, and has the resources and free time to travel to a lab and wait.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but yeah, teaching kids to do chores is probably a good thing.</p>

<p>probably dont need a study to tell you that.</p>

<p>probably doesnt have much of an effect on their future success.</p>

<p>the parents income levels definitely does though, along with the &ldquo;stability&rdquo; of the childs home life. probably shouldnt need studies to tell us that either, but here we are.</p>

<p>and heres an article about a study on that exact topic:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parents-determine-child-success-income-inequality-2014-1" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s The Startling Degree To Which Your Parents Determine Your Success by Alison Griswold | 24 Jan 2014, 2:33 PM ES</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Up until a parent-household-income threshold of roughly <span class="math inline">\(150,000, adult children tend to earn another \)</span>0.33 for every dollar their parents earn. Above that cutoff, the increase they see in their income based on their parents&rsquo; earnings is less dramatic.</p>

      <label for="l6fx94i" class="commentText"><p>With correlations like this (more chores &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; better education and adult happiness), it&rsquo;s more likely that they&rsquo;re the result of the same root cause. For example that children of more stable families, which already have a lot of other advantages, also tend to be given more chores.</p>

<p>The interpretation that the chores in particular provide a substantial contribution to the positive outcome is attractive, but speculative. I would however agree that the professor they interviewed has a reasonable hypothesis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Children also love to feel useful, Waldinger explains, and chores can help foster this, as well as a sense of purpose. Feeling useful and having a sense of purpose continue throughout life all the way into retirement, Waldinger adds, and empirical studies have shown that it may contribute to living a longer life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if this is the main mechanism, then more chores are not useful <em>by themselves</em>. But they can provide a sense of purpose and improve family cohesion if they are administered right, meaning that a family which forces the kid to do work against their will likely will not see similar benefits.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s an important thing to keep in mind, because such correlations often end up getting abused like this. Toxic parents can easily take this to mean that forcing kids to do chores is a good thing, when it may actually backfire big times.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another partial replication of the experiment was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series Basic Instincts. Burger noted that &ldquo;current standards for the ethical treatment of participants clearly place Milgram&rsquo;s studies out of bounds.&rdquo; In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the institutional review board by modifying several of the experimental protocols.[43] Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also Milgram himself tried the experiment in other places, including going for a shadier look with participants not from Yale to test if the prestige of Yale was making obedience rates higher</p>

There’s so much weird shit going on in the script and setup it’s impossible to know what’s going on. They totally ignore the effects the psych evaluation may have had, there are tons of interpersonal touch points where the researchers may be signaling that the shocks aren’t real. They say at numerous points to participants that it isn’t dangerous. It’s just a trash setup. Other attempts have had lackluster results.</p>

<p>Milgram was trying to prove some point about the holocaust with literally no understanding of the social and cultural conditions leading up to it. Milgram willingness to take Eichmann at his word says more about Milgram than about obedience. What a clown.</p>

      <label for="l6fy9vw" class="commentText"><p>The same article also cites substantial criticism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2012 Australian psychologist Gina Perry investigated Milgram&rsquo;s data and writings and concluded that Milgram had manipulated the results, and that there was a &ldquo;troubling mismatch between (published) descriptions of the experiment and evidence of what actually transpired.&rdquo; She wrote that <strong>&ldquo;only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real and of those, 66% disobeyed the experimenter&rdquo;.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that is the case, then the usually cited effect (that a clear majority is willing to go against their conscience) may only be applicable to situations in which people know or have an incling that they&rsquo;re just playing along in a fictional role and that they don&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> inflict pain on innocent people.</p>

<p>After all, who in their right mind would believe that the study they just got invited to includes them being commanded to possibly kill a test subject? This is obviously an implausible situation that most participants won&rsquo;t believe. While many of the test subjects did perceive stress, so do people who are are consuming purely fictional media (and even more so if it&rsquo;s a decently immersive role play in person). It&rsquo;s incomparable to roles such as concentration camp guards.</p>

      <label for="l6fmma9" class="commentText"><p>its even less significant than that. similar to the marshmallow experiment, the sample size was too small to be meaningful and all attempts (afaik) since have been unable to reproduce their results. so really its only useful to discuss that specific group of people/kids. probably. maybe we just shouldnt do weird experiments and try to draw &ldquo;profound&rdquo; insights into psychology.</p>

        <div>77 | 6 hours ago </div>

      <label for="l6f3kh7" class="commentText"><p>I can actually shed light on this. I wrote a paper on this for grad school and interviewed some leading researchers and educators in this field - people who have gone far beyond old studies with homogenous or biased participant groups.</p>

<p>So, some history first. As the wealth of the middle class grew in the 20th century and especially women and minorities gained access to college as a result of social change, society overwhelmingly moved towards going to college as the baseline for success. Thus, middle school and grade school actually stopped becoming play/work/chore time for children and in fact transitioned into a kind of pseudo college preparation, whether we realized it or not. A child&rsquo;s job these days is to study hard to get into a good college, not to manage a home and do chores. It&rsquo;s intellectual labor, not physical. (Of course every household differs in their stance on chores.)</p>

<p>That, along with the decrease in Home Economics classes in high school over the last 80 years or so (due to the transition into intellectual labor) has basically created a big hole where children aren&rsquo;t learning life skills (especially social-emotional and problem solving skills).</p>

<p>Kids used to learn all this stuff at home and in HomeEc classes. That&rsquo;s why so many Boomers and Gen X are pretty good with their hands and maintaining homes. They literally had to do it at home AND they had school-based training on it. Whereas Millennials and Gen Z have to figure it out on YouTube or TikTok because they were pushed towards college as their primary goal above all else.</p>

<p>These days, there isn&rsquo;t actually place available to do hands-on social-emotional and problem solving skills so consistently and actively. Basically, kids aren&rsquo;t able to learn these skills at home (because they&rsquo;re doing intellectual labor instead), OR at school (there&rsquo;s no class available because college prep is more important), so, they&rsquo;re just not learning them. They don&rsquo;t even know what they don&rsquo;t know. And then they get into college and freak out or fail because they&rsquo;ve never had an opportunity to learn the mass of unspoken knowledge associated with chores, which turns out to be the unspoken knowledge of maintaining a person&rsquo;s independent life.</p>

<p>So where are they supposed to learn these skills then? Because as it turns out, so-called &ldquo;domestic labor&rdquo; or chores are actually really important for developing an effective adult.</p>

<p>So let me give you an example - laundry. The chore of doing laundry is so much more than the task of washing and drying clothes. That&rsquo;s just the direct output. The indirect output is that you learn an enormous amount of unspoken, unapparent skills, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Managing Time, Consequences, and Gratification Delay - &ldquo;Oh, I have to do this before I can go play.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Organizing Tasks - &ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s how I sort things and fold things and keep a clean area.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Managing Resources - &ldquo;Oh, I have to add this much detergent and fill this many clothes into the washer.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Problem Solving - &ldquo;Oh, my clothes didn&rsquo;t dry last time, I need to clean the lint trap I think.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, why did this shrink?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, what buttons do I need to push and how do I figure that out?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Negotiating - &ldquo;Ugh, I don&rsquo;t want to do this. Will my parent give me something in exchange for doing this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Outside Interactions/transactions - &ldquo;Oh, this is the detergent and softener we buy a the store.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how my parent buys it and here&rsquo;s how they interact with the store person and what money is and means.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Domestic labor does actually translate into real life, and not just in learning how to complete tasks, but in learning all the social-emotional and problem-solving skills adjacent to them. It&rsquo;s all the silent knowledge gained outside of the task and the struggle to figure out that silent knowledge that seems to help create an effective adult. The research seems to suggest that domestic labor is a really good way to help develop an effective adult. It&rsquo;s not the only way, and there are tons of factors to this, but this seems to be a good one.</p>

      <label for="l6fp735" class="commentText"><p>You explained that so well, thank you. I had never thought to look at the generational differences due to these domestic and life skills training contrasts.  Which also heavily involve gender and cultural expectation changes as well no doubt. I fall into elder millenial and have never been able to go to my parents for home repair help, as they just used contractors when they had homes or when they fell into renting it didn’t matter - I always had to consult the Internet, or older friends. I felt very alone, like others had family that helped them - but this made me realize there are probably more like me than not.</p>

He and the neighbor helped each other with maintenance and even additions. I still remember my proudest day when I was the only one small enough to pull a wire through the area behind the attic knee wall! 😊 I can do basic plumbing, electrical work, tile and brick, drywall, even plaster lathe but pretty sure nobody does that anymore. I can’t work on cars though. I learned on mechanical automobiles, today’s computer component machines look unreal to me. I suppose I could change a tire though, that hasn’t changed much. I’m getting up there in years and try to do things with my grandchildren but they are not as interested as I was.
PS… I’m a woman and was the house handyman until I kicked the ex to the curb 🤣</p>

      <label for="l6fesc2" class="commentText"><p>Were your parents particularly good at keeping house?</p>

<p>It’s something I think about a lot actually. I really struggle with household stuff too, and have lots of emotions tied to it. I wasn’t really made to do chores after age 7 for a variety of reasons but I generally look successful on the outside (stable job, own a house, the place isn’t a pit though could use a good dust more often). Looking back, my parents clearly struggled with house work themselves so I didn’t learn a lot and I can tell I inherited a lot of bullshit around it.</p>

<p>So anyway my point to all that is I think there’s a lot more that goes into it than this study would show (which is the case with a lot of these types of sociological studies).</p>

<p>More a diminishing return.</p>

<p>Kind of like someone with $30k/yr would be 50% happy, 60k/yr 75%, someone with 100k/yr would be 90% happy and someone with 1000k a year would be 92% happy.  All other things not related to money being the same.</p>

<p>Guess what.  I resented every minute of it.  When I moved out I went the opposite.  Because I hated to clean and I needed a fucking break from all the housework, and hired a housekeeper to clean for me at least once a week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll speak of another one frequently quoted in self-help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children who were more capable of delaying gratification found more professional success and happiness later in life&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone found the study a bit strange and went over and looked at all the data and methodology.</p>

<p>You know what else it correlated with?</p>

<p>Socio-economic status.</p>

<p>Decades of data literally erased lmao. The whole time they just found a way to test a child&rsquo;s background. Which while interesting, isn&rsquo;t particularly useful.</p>

      <label for="l6frtbx" class="commentText"><p>Okay but my question is this. Does doing chores make them more predisposed to success? Or are kids that are predisposed to being willing to do chores just also predisposed to greater success. Or is there even any kind of link at all?</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s very easy to say &ldquo;kids that do chores end up more successful&rdquo; while leaving out things like &ldquo;people who struggle with executive function (like people with certain neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD) struggle with both chores and career success.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l6fxtq6" class="commentText"><p>Obligatory Correlation ≠ Causation. It could simply be that happy children tend to become happy adults. In other words forcing kids to do chores may not affect their adult lives one way or the other. It may just be a good predictor of what sort of adult they will become. See the marshmallow test.</p>

<p>I don’t think anybody can give any legitimate advice about this. Nobody knows what the world‘s gonna look like in five years, let alone 30.

      <label for="l6fgh3e" class="commentText"><p>This seems like a typical wishy-washy &ldquo;social science phenomenon&rdquo; that is tough to generalize to the broader population. On an individual level, I can definitely see how doing chores could help a child. Maybe it keeps them out of trouble, maybe it teaches them self-sufficiency, or maybe it just teaches them how to get through boring but necessary tasks. It would depend strongly on the individual.</p>

<p>Further, how many chores do you need to do to actually see an effect? I had many siblings, so we might have one or two things we rotated doing. Some kids I grew up were essentially the man/woman of the house because their family was so dysfunctional. Also, I imagine kids from affluent backgrounds that don&rsquo;t have as many chores might have more free time to explore their interests and hobbies. What is the data on these kids?</p>

Not that I&rsquo;m blaming it on that I&rsquo;m just saying, this isn&rsquo;t my experience. Feel like supporting and nurturing your kids is the key, and inheritance seems to help those who receive one. I&rsquo;m 1 of 6 and we all worked in the home to help our parents out and we&rsquo;re all Massave failures in life lol. My best friends mother practically waited on her and she is the best off out of all of us, my dad and his brothers all do well and my grandmother was like a servant to them. This study is clearly rigged by a lazy mother.</p>

      <label for="l6fc9l7" class="commentText"><p>yeah i think if you did chores WITH your kids, in a HAPPY way, not forceful, not &lsquo;pretending&rsquo; and forcing kids to &lsquo;smile when they do it&rsquo;, it would just be seen as an activity like breathing. or pooping LOL things you just do, and cooking etc</p>

<p>but if parents had a lot of fighting/arguing anywhere or in the home, then that starts up addictive/avoidant behaviors in kids, and no wonder the child doesnt want to do its chores, and then you have to TELL the child to be grateful for having a roof, food, and an &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; to do chores. but it really was as subtle and nuanced as negative emotions in the home that make life not worth working for (and not worth living, when you go down that road to depression for many years). all we kids want to do at that point is &lsquo;feel better&rsquo; with relaxation and dopamine - not this stupid lie that we owe you EXTRA work for us to JUST live normal emotional lives</p>
