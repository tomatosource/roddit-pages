      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d8zs1y/the_top_two_headlines_about_the_nba_are_the/"><p>The top two headlines about the NBA are the immense amount of money involved in the new broadcast deal, and a gambling scandal with a player throwing games. They&rsquo;re not unrelated.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Things are quickly getting out of hand with the NBA and sports betting. Now, it may be true in other leagues as well, I&rsquo;m just focusing on the one I&rsquo;m following.</p>

<p>Legalizing gambling is a fucking disease. Watching Barkley promoting corporate, mechanized gambling machines and having literal odds shoved down our throats every quarter is disgusting and hurting the integrity of the game.</p>

<p>And with bigger and bigger sums of money involved, the bigger the motivation for foul actors to get involved. The gambling ads fuel the tv revenue, and more eyes create more gamblers - many of them are facing serious addiction problems, that they now can&rsquo;t get away from because it&rsquo;s pumped on screen and by the announcers all the time.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;industry&rdquo; was outlawed for decades for a reason, and that reason was exactly the corruption, depravity, and destitution gambling leads to. And it&rsquo;s only going to get way way worse before any action against it. I just hope the gambling companies won&rsquo;t get <em>too big</em> so they&rsquo;ll capture Washington and local governments as well.</p>

<p>edit: I was referring to the r/nba <a href="https://imgur.com/1SrF2ft" target="_blank">top two posts</a>, y&rsquo;all can relax in the comments lol.</p>

EVERYBODY saw it (them) coming, but no one wanted to develop a set of rules and regulations to govern it. So instead we have the wild west and minimal ability to rein it in.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also in the mind that alcohol has <em>significant</em> cultural impact and value in our society, and curbing it goes against a lot of our shared traditions lasting millennia. The same is not true of gambling in an industrial scale, which I think is devastating and offers very little to our society or culture in return.</p>

      <label for="l7a09nr" class="commentText"><p>I think adults should be able to participate in actions they wish to partake in&hellip; Even if those are detrimental to them. For example smoking weed or even doing cocaine, they can be harmful to people, I personally know an amazing woman that had her entire marriage ruined and life derailed because her husband had a crippling weed habit that sapped him of doing anything productive (she&rsquo;s now happily remarried!)&hellip; But that&rsquo;s not reason enough to ban it, for example.</p>

<p>What worries me mostly is the scale. Gambling touches a very sensitive addiction nerve in a lot of people and can bring their financial demise very quickly - and their entire families with them, since debt tends to stick to entire families, not just the individual.</p>

<p>Now, we have this very dangerous thing out there, and the most effective way to weaponize it - legalization, normalization (Charles Barkely cracking jokes about it in primetime), and easy access. It&rsquo;s no longer seedy bookies at the back of a bar or even going physically to wage a bet in an agency. It&rsquo;s in an app, you don&rsquo;t feel the money flow out, the app is designed to prey on you and give you dopamine rushes and manipulate you psychologically&hellip; And combined with the already existing weakness, I honestly believe this potent shit can and will destroy families and communities. It could be the new opioid addiction. Why not nip it in the bud?</p>

<p>If gambling was heavily regulated I&rsquo;d talk differently. But right now it&rsquo;s a free for all, it&rsquo;s an insane social experiment that&rsquo;s unheard of in our history, and unlike a bar or a liquor store that you physically need to go to and can deny you service, it&rsquo;s at the tip of your hand, no limits. And I think it&rsquo;s wrong, and not worth it for us as society to promote it.</p>

      <label for="l7a2cd4" class="commentText"><p>You’re very well spoken on this issue. Seems you’ve put some thought into it. This can go into a deeper discussion about corruption in politics, but that IS the issue. There’s money to be made for the league and these betting companies, so they will shell out money to politicians to, first, get it legalized at a large scale, and second, to prevent regulations that may hurt their bottom line. You’d think Adam Silver and all his talk about “integrity of the league” would’ve recognize this and not allowed to it be promoted in the ways it is. Unless he doesn’t really care about that (he doesn’t) and is only worried about his pockets as well (he is).</p>

<p>Question is how does that problem get fixed?</p>

There might be a few outliers out there who can win 55-60% of the time, but for most schmoe&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re gonna lose your ass. And I agree the ads and forced live takes make me want to vomit.

<p>That said, it has 1000% gotten out of hand with the amount of advisement it’s gotten. There’s no reason for the league or anyone who covers it in an official capacity to be shoving odds or even talking about gambling period.

      <label for="l79z9kc" class="commentText"><p>Well said. Gambling is a vice. I definitely think it was the popularity of daily fantasy that allowed the casinos to wrench their foot back in the door. It seemed innocent because you weren&rsquo;t betting on the outcome of the game, just some random player&rsquo;s performances. It got so popular that it made sports wagering start to look more attractive again.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a massive, massive link between daily fantasy and Vegas. A lot of the Daily Fantasy gurus are using Vegas&rsquo; projections to make their wagers. The daily fantasy players started getting all used to looking at spreads and over-unders every day while trying to pick their players. Still not wagering on the outcome of the game, but getting extremely used to seeing and using the information and betting lines that Vegas is tinkering with morning, noon, and night.</p>

<p>That opened people up to the idea that betting on the spread isn&rsquo;t THAT much different from making a fantasy team since they were looking at the spreads constantly anyway. Eventually, people warmed up to the idea enough that Vegas was probably able to take back a very solid chunk of the money that was going to Drafkings and Fanduel instead.</p>

<p>Vegas is king because nowhere on planet Earth are they better at predicting the outcome of these games. The odds makers in Vegas are masters. They are the masters of understanding how these sports work and exactly how tge game is likely to unfold</p>

      <label for="l7a2czi" class="commentText"><p>This sub is such a weird ass hive mind.</p>

<p>Gambling in moderation makes sports more interesting and the idea that refs or players getting paid off is novel is incredibly naive.</p>

<p>If you have a gambling problem that&rsquo;s on you. Don&rsquo;t get in the way of my enjoyment of sports.</p>

      <label for="l79w9gu" class="commentText"><p>I dont think having an issue with the current landscape of gambling has to be virtue signaling. I have been doing it for the past 10 years and think whats going on right now isnt good.</p>
