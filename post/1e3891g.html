<p><strong>Ryan McDonough:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>”Andy, take us inside this offseason as it pertains to Jimmy Butler. He’s been the best player on two different Eastern Conference champions. I’m not gonna ask you to predict how it ends, but Jimmy has this year under contract, he has a player option for next year at about $52 million, he is extension eligible now, so what are the different options and discussions that you foresee potentially taking place with Jimmy over the next 12 months?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Andy Elisburg:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>”As Pat Riley said in his press conference, it isn’t something we have to do now. We have an opportunity to do this all year long, and then there’s an opportunity that he becomes a free agent next year and we sit down do a contract at that point. If a player wants to be in Miami, and we want him in Miami, the rest of it is logistics. That’s how Pat has always approached it. Whether it’s [cap] room or timing, that just becomes a piece of it.”</p>

<p>“I think Jimmy’s indicated he wants to be in Miami, and at the end of the day we would like Jimmy to be in Miami. Pat has indicated in his postseason press conference that there are things he wants to see, and there are challenges he wants met. Jimmy’s not one who is familiar with being challenged. Pat and Jimmy are two very strong-willed people who are looking for the same thing, which is ultimately to win.”</p>

<p>”My view of it is that it ultimately work itself out — there are lots of ways it can work out — and foremost, do the player and the team want to be continue working together? If they do, there are lots of ways to make the rest of the numbers work if everyone wants to make a deal, there are lots of ways you can make the deal with different pieces to it. The most important thing is everyone wanting to make the deal.”</p>

<p>Is this not a crazy thing to say in general about a player? Feels even crazier when you consider Jimmy Butler was semi-homeless for years, got drafted 30th and made himself into an all star. Not to mention he was coached by Thibs but Jimmy isn’t familiar with being challenged?</p>
