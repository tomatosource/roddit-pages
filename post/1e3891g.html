<p><strong>Ryan McDonough:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>”Andy, take us inside this offseason as it pertains to Jimmy Butler. He’s been the best player on two different Eastern Conference champions. I’m not gonna ask you to predict how it ends, but Jimmy has this year under contract, he has a player option for next year at about $52 million, he is extension eligible now, so what are the different options and discussions that you foresee potentially taking place with Jimmy over the next 12 months?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Andy Elisburg:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>”As Pat Riley said in his press conference, it isn’t something we have to do now. We have an opportunity to do this all year long, and then there’s an opportunity that he becomes a free agent next year and we sit down and do a contract at that point. If a player wants to be in Miami, and we want him in Miami, the rest of it is logistics. That’s how Pat has always approached it. Whether it’s [cap] room or timing, that just becomes a piece of it.”</p>

<p>“I think Jimmy’s indicated he wants to be in Miami, and at the end of the day we would like Jimmy to be in Miami. Pat has indicated in his postseason press conference that there are things he wants to see, and there are challenges he wants met. Jimmy’s not one who is familiar with being challenged. Pat and Jimmy are two very strong-willed people who are looking for the same thing, which is ultimately to win.”</p>

<p>”My view of it is that it ultimately work itself out — there are lots of ways it can work out — and foremost, do the player and the team want to be continue working together? If they do, there are lots of ways to make the rest of the numbers work if everyone wants to make a deal, there are lots of ways you can make the deal with different pieces to it. The most important thing is everyone wanting to make the deal.”</p>

<p>Is this not a crazy thing to say in general about a player? Feels even crazier when you consider Jimmy Butler was semi-homeless for years, got drafted 30th and made himself into an all star. Not to mention he was coached by Thibs but Jimmy isn’t familiar with being challenged?</p>

      <label for="ld6j74t" class="commentText"><p>Here’s a better way to put it…the media image put out by Jimmy and his agent/team have always been framed like Jimmy is in control of every decision and he knew what was best for each team. See every team he’s left and the narratives for why he left. </p>

<p>Jimmy is never the problem, everyone else is in Jimmys eyes. When the teams suck, Jimmy acts like an ass and if players don’t respond or improve he skips town rather than finding ways to make it work. Jimmy has always gotten what benefited Jimmy first and it’s likely a personality trait he developed to manage the life cards he was dealt before the nba. </p>

<p>I believe this is what they meant by challenged. Jimmy has to agree to trust the franchises plan without disagreeing. That’s the challenge for him and really every damn employee in the world.</p>

      <label for="ld6ex81" class="commentText"><p>I feel like, ultimately, those finals runs made Riley complacent to the fact that while they were amongst the best teams in the East, they were never going to beat any team that came out of the West. That meant he was perfectly content with the roster as is, and any addition was made out of convenience (i.e. vet mins).</p>

<p>I feel like the moment they lost to Lakers in the bubble, they should have went all in with getting another star to group with Butler and Bam. They had good value in Herro at the time, and probably could have made a decent package for a second offensive star.</p>

      <label for="ld6kcgm" class="commentText"><p>They survived the break up of the Heatles. They can survive losing Jimmy. That’s the threat that Riley always has. He’s got decades of proof that he finds ways to stay relevant. I think folks are being a little reactionary to think the Heat are making drastic mistakes. They tried to win in the window they have and the ease of playing in the East allows the window to exist longer than for a team in the west.</p>

      <label for="ld6kupe" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with the quote. Could&rsquo;ve used more fleshing out, but it&rsquo;s not untrue that Jimmy has an alpha mentality and kind of a my-way-or-the-highway mentality. It&rsquo;s not untrue Jimmy has dogged it a bit in regular seasons the last few years. It&rsquo;s not untrue Jimmy likes to get his hands into operational decision making.</p>

<p>But one thing I respect out of the culture Pat and the Heat have created is that no one player is bigger than the team, and they&rsquo;re really making that clear. Publicly. That&rsquo;s more of what I have an issue with&hellip;not everything needs to be made public.</p>
