There‚Äôs guys on G league rosters that can flat out put the ball in the bucket if you let them run the show‚Ä¶but they aren‚Äôt as good at a particular skill (3 point shooting, shot blocking, ball handling, etc) as guys on rosters are, and most rosters already have a guy they want running the show.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to be consistent offensively when you only get 4-8 shots a game and the shots come sporadically. Some guys are capable of it and that‚Äôs why they stick around</p>

      <label for="lsqn4vv" class="commentText"><p>Obst is good enough to be a backend NBA rotation player (like a 11th man in the NBA) but people are also overrating him in some of the below comments. He‚Äôs a 7.5 PPG scorer shooting barely 40% from the field and a non constant starter in the Euroleague.</p>

<p>I can name 40 better Euroleague players so I don‚Äôt know why Obst became such a great example unless you were carried away by 2 FIBA WC games.¬†</p>

<p>Anyways I agree with your main point about there are players not in the NBA good enough to play but just wanted to also say Obst isn‚Äôt some Euroleague superstar people think he is.¬†</p>

      <label for="lsqh4p2" class="commentText"><p>I can give you a quick example of a couple of players that went to Europe and had to put in work to get noticed and come back to the NBA. PJ Tucker and Mike James come to mind. As for guys that waited until their later years to play in the league Sabonis and Teodosic come to mind right away. Hell, if we look at the Olympics this summer, everyone saw a taste of how good some international talent was even though it was under FIBA rules</p>

<p>Its something that&rsquo;s difficult to find examples for off hand because we&rsquo;re not talking about missing the next Luka. We&rsquo;re talking mostly about bench players and the rare fringe starter that can be found outside the league.</p>

<p>We rely on human scouts to find the best talent so by default some people will fall through the cracks. Think about the amount of undrafted and 2nd round players that ended up being stars/all nba talent. On top of that, teams regularly waste roster spots on guys like Killian Hayes who are definitely not the best available player but they can&rsquo;t part with them easily due to contracts. This is just the tip of the iceberg really, because we need to consider things like teams making roster decisions based on star player demands, fit, willingness to play limited minutes, attitude etc.</p>

<p>I remember Marc gasol saying he understands why Kawhi wanted to go home to LA. Mentioning that if he could get paid good money to go back to Spain, he would never play a single game in the nba again. With these leagues growing who knows, maybe guys are ok with making solid money in their home countries if they know they would have to deal with the politics and unfavourable situations in the nba</p>

      <label for="lsqkp80" class="commentText"><p>Maybe as a collective unit they&rsquo;re getting better but as individual talent, no, they&rsquo;d already be in the NBA or have done some time. At the end of the day, Team USA has a lot of pageantry involved. Lebron can average 15ppg in 2028 and still probably start. They could care less about winning by 40 if winning by 10 can get a picture perfect finish.</p>

      <label for="lsrchfh" class="commentText"><p>Google says that the average Euroleague salary is between $400k - 800k a year. With the best players in the league getting around 2 mil annually.</p>

<p>Compared to NBA salaries, that&rsquo;s peanuts. But if they can keep solidifying those salaries and it will be much more appealing for players to stay in Europe longer. Even if I cannot see the Euroleague offering actually comparable salaries to the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lsrbgrc" class="commentText"><p>I mean Udonis Haslem was on an NBA roster for like 4 years longer than he should have been, Thanassis is on an NBA roster, I&rsquo;m sure there are a few other examples as well. Some teams just rightfully keep certain NBA players on rosters for locker room presence / semi-coaching responsibilities. Plus, theoretically an NBA team could &ldquo;always&rdquo; churn the bottom 4-5 players on its roster and find better guys but teams also value continuity as well so there&rsquo;s not an entirely efficient system of the best players coming into and going out of the league.</p>

<p>And the gap between the 444th best NBA player the 15th best &ldquo;not-in-the-NBA player&rdquo; is probably pretty small.</p>

<p>That said, I&rsquo;d say there are tops ~200 more players not in the league who could make an NBA roster and contribute meaningful minutes. This includes G-League players, D1 players who could transition into the league, and Euro / overseas players. Overall the pool of professional basketball players capable of playing in the league is still pretty small.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah and this is pretty common when we talk &ldquo;development&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A lot of people expect rookies to add entire new facets to their game, but that&rsquo;s pretty rare.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown is a good example. He&rsquo;s often touted as someone who built out his game tremendously and added quite a lot.</p>

<p>The pullup and stepback 3s, the post-ups, the transition passing, the shifty in and out drives. Those were all big stepping stones in Brown&rsquo;s career&hellip; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3T-ul7PEsk" target="_blank">But you can see flashes of them in his 10-year-old highschool mixtapes.</a></p>

<p>He did also add a lot to his game, but a lot of his development was just bringing his skills up to NBA standards.</p>

<hr>

<p>With Yabu it&rsquo;s the same.</p>

<p>We drafted him because we liked his potential and we even saw flashes of his potential in Boston, but he wasn&rsquo;t consistent and he wasn&rsquo;t NBA ready.</p>

<p>Philly aren&rsquo;t getting a whole new player, they&rsquo;re getting the Yabusele we were hoping to get.</p>

      <label for="lsr0hn7" class="commentText"><p>And this has been the case more and more in recent years. In the past, a high caliber 4 year college player was an ideal draft prospect for many teams. Now, spending a full 4 years in college is pretty much seen as a negative. There have been so many all-american caliber players either falling to the 2nd round or going undrafted.</p>

<p>I look at guys like Ayo Donsumu with the Bulls. Less than 10 years ago he would have been a high lottery pick, but we were able to scoop him in the 2nd round. His Illini teammate Kofi Cockburn, a 2x all-american, 2x all-Big 10, Freshman of the Year, 7ft almost 300lb monster went completely undrafted. In early 2000s he would have been a top 5 pick easily. The game and scouting are so different now.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs also probably 25ish guys in Europe that are plenty good enough to play in the NBA but choose to stay. The pay in Europe can be decent, often times a better live style in a culture and language you are familiar with. Why come to the NBA to possibly sit on the bench in a country you‚Äôre not comfortable in.</p>

He&rsquo;s definitely a top 500 player in the world and you can argue he&rsquo;s a better overall/complete player than the two, but he&rsquo;s not good enough in the roles those other 2 brought to the Kings and he got frustrated and left to go back Euroleague where he can be a focal point for a team.</p>

<p>The book <em>Heaven is a Playground</em> focuses on a playground at one of the projects in NYC. While you had NBA players like Bernard and Albert King come from there, you also had players that were very, very talented but didn&rsquo;t have the smarts, work ethic, etc. to make it to college or to keep clean while in college. It&rsquo;s been a while since I read the book, but one of the main kids whose story he relates got accepted to a small Midwestern college and was lighting up the games but would also get in fistfights with opponents on the court, wouldn&rsquo;t go to class like at all, and so on.</p>

<p>The issue is if you have a guy outside of those 15 who is a better shooter or passer etc than 1-2 of the team members the team doesn‚Äôt want them. They want those role players. Adding that shooter and removing that defender Will literally make the team win fewer games.</p>

<p>A lot of times, these players are used to be the best player on college, shoot 20 times per game and play little defense. When they go to a team that have Kevin Durant, they have to play a different role and sometimes they cannot play that position.</p>

<p>I am sure many guys outside the NBA are better scorers and iso players than many guys who are in the NBA. But can you defend? Can you rebound? Can you understand an offense? Can you spot up at the 3 line and consistently make 35% of the looks you‚Äôll get? Can you show up to practice and the games on time all the time?</p>

<p>All of that matters. I have firsthand seen NBA players get smoked in places like dyckman, ruckers, drew league etc. by no names. But those guys are one dimensional and can‚Äôt be role players in the NBA. Such is life.</p>

      <label for="lsrbdo6" class="commentText"><p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>Players think handles and a bag make you a good player.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s street ball, 1 v 1 shit.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not actual team basketball.  Where you need to check your ego at the door and have an actual understanding of what all 10 players are doing.</p>

<p>AND be fast enough to not get abused.</p>

<p>AND be strong enough to not get abused.</p>

<p>AND be tall/long enough to not get abused.</p>

<p>I would wager that the number of individuals encompassing all of that not already in the NBA is maybe in the low dozens globally, and 90% if them are playing high end Euro ball and don&rsquo;t want to be in the NBA (and the USA).</p>

<p>The actual number of guys better than NBA players and not in the NBA who might even want ot be is probably countable on 1 hand.</p>

      <label for="lsrdxx9" class="commentText"><p>Why I agree: There‚Äôs definitely a lot that goes into filling out a roster that is predicated on politics, opportunity, draft stock, and agents. There are definitely some players outside the NBA who are better than guys in the NBA. Especially when you consider that there is a class of pass/shoot/dribble guys who are probably ‚Äúbetter ballers‚Äù than some of the one-dimensional rim running &amp; rebounding role players.</p>

<p>Why I disagree: NBA is still the best of the best. There is not a guy who would break the Top 100 players in the world who is not playing in the NBA. There are probably only a handful of guys in the Top 300 not in the NBA. And there are probably 1000 guys worldwide or in college who are on a similar level as the guys filling in the last few roster spots but may or may not be in the NBA. The best of the best make their way to the top.</p>

      <label for="lsre6kk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. Teams will work on developing young talent rather than sign a vet that&rsquo;s on his last legs but is playing better, but that&rsquo;s a different situation.</p>

<p>And yes, there are selfish players who are extremely talented who don&rsquo;t have a net positive impact on the team despite how talented they are.</p>

<p>But with some anomalous exceptions (*coughs, coughs, Bronny*) most guys in the league have earned their spots, and the talented guys who aren&rsquo;t in the league typically have themselves to blame.</p>

      <label for="lsqi7sz" class="commentText"><p>I mean it‚Äôs objectively true because the realities of team building and roster management necessitates it being true.</p>

<p>Basically there‚Äôs a salary cap where you‚Äôre paying for future performances but compensation is usually predicated on past performances.  Young but less talented players are a better investment than more skilled older players since they‚Äôre more likely to outperform their contract than an older player.  On top of that there‚Äôs a metagame which means that certain skill sets are more favored than others. On top of that there‚Äôs no incentive for a bad team to have the ‚Äòbest available player‚Äô when they can take some lottery tickets and hope to find one more valuable than the rest.</p>
