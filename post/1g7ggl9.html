<p>What? His handles don&rsquo;t actually get him anywhere against defense unless you&rsquo;re talking random dudes at the park. There&rsquo;s no way he can create against NBA defenders in the same way your 5 year old nephew can&rsquo;t create against you, no matter how many moves he tries.</p>

<p>Good handles get you to the place on the court you want to go, through defenders and on balance so you have options. It&rsquo;s the difference between Lebron James and Paul George- one guy has been consistently effective with the ball for 2 decades, the other looks smooth when he dribbles but doesn&rsquo;t really go anywhere. Guess which one is a top 2 player of all-time?</p>

Then yes, he has a much better outside shot and offball game than he did back in the day, but his first step isn&rsquo;t there anymore against skilled d1 defender level guards the way it was. He still has a lot of tricks in the bag though, all day lockdown isn&rsquo;t happening.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about years ago, you&rsquo;re way off base I saw him absolutely wreck d1 guards that made the league in iso a couple times (no I&rsquo;ll not say names one of them has suffered enough, but I&rsquo;ll say it was in the PNW as clues) but back then you could just play off him because he couldn&rsquo;t shoot from outside reliably.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re just a guy who played d1 and has seen some tape of him and are sure that he&rsquo;s not that good and you were better&hellip; whatever helps you feel good about your standard deviations from Brian Scalabrine.</p>

      <label for="lst1jh1" class="commentText"><p>So, so, so many basketball narratives fall into that, even among NBA players. People are absolutely enamored with the idea of a one-man worldbeating &ldquo;hooper&rdquo; instead of people that actually make 5v5 impact.</p>

<p>I think a lot of really good &ldquo;role players&rdquo; are WAY better basketball players than some of the mediocre primary options.</p>

Lamelo certainly did more on court but I think a lot of people valued how Lonzo was an efficient shooter who played great defense and could rebound good for a guard and could run your offense. His only real weakness is he just wasn&rsquo;t great at penetration. Decent offball too. I think every team could use Lonzo.</p>

He‚Äôs a 7.5 PPG scorer shooting barely 40% from the field and a non constant starter in the Euroleague.</p>

<p>I can name 40 better Euroleague players so I don‚Äôt know why Obst became such a great example unless you were carried away by 2 FIBA WC games.¬†</p>

<p>Anyways I agree with your main point about there are players not in the NBA good enough to play but just wanted to also say Obst isn‚Äôt some Euroleague superstar people think he is.¬†</p>

      <label for="lsrgiaz" class="commentText"><p>Oh right that‚Äôs why I think he would still be an NBA player at the end of the rotation if he chose to come over. I just don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as good as players such as Shane Larkin, Kendrick Nunn, Evan Fournier, Sasha Vezenkov, Nikola Mirotic, Jabari Parker, Edy Tavares, Markelle Fultz, Robert Covington, Landry Shamet, Isaiah Cordinier, Cooper Flagg, AJ Dynbatsa, and others not in the NBA (the last 2 are the only prospects I‚Äôll mention since others are too raw).</p>

<p>The biggest problem is he‚Äôs a 6‚Äô3‚Äù whose main skill is to space the floor and shoot 3s. He doesn‚Äôt really have another great skill like ball handling, playmaking, or defense, so it limits his NBA role quite a bit. ¬†</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt realize my comment chain got split up but there is another one where a person told me Obst would be a starter on several current NBA teams, and that‚Äôs going way too far and why I posted my above comment. With that said, he still fits the post as a backend NBA rotation player due to his one elite skill, but I just think he‚Äôs also not as good as what people might perceive at the same time.¬†</p>

<p>There are a lot of guys in the G-League who are &lsquo;better&rsquo; than him, in that they are ballers in the G-League and can score 20-25 points per game there and dominate in a way he wouldn&rsquo;t. But he plays a specific role better than they do.</p>

<p>you got raw young guys that are cheaper than vets that have high potential</p>

<p>you got Euroleague stars who have a much better life living in an elite European city with bigger roles and a better standard of living</p>

<p>You got NBA vets that are 26-29 that can&rsquo;t fit a specific role.</p>

      <label for="lsr6ljw" class="commentText"><p>Yup, as with most sports with veteran minimum salaries, teams would rather take a chance to sign a young guy to a deal below their value than &lsquo;overpay&rsquo; a veteran who isn&rsquo;t necessarily significantly more talented. Potential is always worth more to a GM because they&rsquo;re always looking for value. You can&rsquo;t get value if you have to pay a 5-year veteran at the end of your bench $2.5m a year when at the same time you can get a rookie first round pick/potential starter for the same price.</p>

<p>And of course at the top of the draft, you have all-star caliber young players like Victor Wembanyama making $11m, which is less than De&rsquo;Anthony Melton, a six-year vet who is a 3-and-D guy with a history of back problems.</p>

      <label for="lsqrag7" class="commentText"><p>Also comes down to role acceptance IMO. If your choices are #1 scorer on a Euro team vs the 13th guy on an NBA bench you may not make that switch. You‚Äôre also more likely to demand a higher salary than the current 13th guy on the bench which in a salary capped sport is important too.¬†</p>

      <label for="lsqh4p2" class="commentText"><p>I can give you a quick example of a couple of players that went to Europe and had to put in work to get noticed and come back to the NBA. PJ Tucker and Mike James come to mind. As for guys that waited until their later years to play in the league Sabonis and Teodosic come to mind right away. Hell, if we look at the Olympics this summer, everyone saw a taste of how good some international talent was even though it was under FIBA rules</p>

<p>Its something that&rsquo;s difficult to find examples for off hand because we&rsquo;re not talking about missing the next Luka. We&rsquo;re talking mostly about bench players and the rare fringe starter that can be found outside the league.</p>

<p>We rely on human scouts to find the best talent so by default some people will fall through the cracks. Think about the amount of undrafted and 2nd round players that ended up being stars/all nba talent. On top of that, teams regularly waste roster spots on guys like Killian Hayes who are definitely not the best available player but they can&rsquo;t part with them easily due to contracts. This is just the tip of the iceberg really, because we need to consider things like teams making roster decisions based on star player demands, fit, willingness to play limited minutes, attitude etc.</p>

<p>Often not worth it to spend an extra 5-10M filling out your 3rd string with vets instead of young players even if the vets are better and the young guys don&rsquo;t have much potential</p>

      <label for="lsr4qb3" class="commentText"><p>The NBA does try to help veterans out a little by making it so the cap impact for veteran of 3 years or more is set at 2nd year veteran level. The league also reimburses team the difference in salaries.</p>

<p>The 30th draft pick often makes more in his first year than 2nd year vet min because most sign of 120% of the allowable, and each subsequent year is more expensive. The 2nd round pick or udfa minimum contracts are cheaper than vet min by about 900k but you&rsquo;re also getting a rookie that isn&rsquo;t likely to contribute first year anyways.</p>

<p>I remember Marc gasol saying he understands why Kawhi wanted to go home to LA. Mentioning that if he could get paid good money to go back to Spain, he would never play a single game in the nba again. With these leagues growing who knows, maybe guys are ok with making solid money in their home countries if they know they would have to deal with the politics and unfavourable situations in the nba</p>

At the end of the day, Team USA has a lot of pageantry involved. Lebron can average 15ppg in 2028 and still probably start. They could care less about winning by 40 if winning by 10 can get a picture perfect finish.</p>

<p>Compared to NBA salaries, that&rsquo;s peanuts. But if they can keep solidifying those salaries and it will be much more appealing for players to stay in Europe longer. Even if I cannot see the Euroleague offering actually comparable salaries to the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lsrfpk8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, like the thing from a fan perspective is that by the time you get down to non-rotation NBA, vs. G-league, vs top international players, the differences don‚Äôt really move the needle at all for a team. Fans mostly like upside guys in those roles. From a coach perspective, by the time you get down there, you‚Äôre either looking for upside or more often filling specific roles, which may not have much to do with who is objectively better. From a player perspective of course when you‚Äôre one of those guys, the difference between being in the nba vs not is huge. So I get why a player would focus on what feels fair or doesn‚Äôt.</p>

      <label for="lsr0hn7" class="commentText"><p>And this has been the case more and more in recent years. In the past, a high caliber 4 year college player was an ideal draft prospect for many teams. Now, spending a full 4 years in college is pretty much seen as a negative. There have been so many all-american caliber players either falling to the 2nd round or going undrafted.</p>

<p>I look at guys like Ayo Donsumu with the Bulls. Less than 10 years ago he would have been a high lottery pick, but we were able to scoop him in the 2nd round. His Illini teammate Kofi Cockburn, a 2x all-american, 2x all-Big 10, Freshman of the Year, 7ft almost 300lb monster went completely undrafted. In early 2000s he would have been a top 5 pick easily. The game and scouting are so different now.</p>

<p>One of the points I always bring up when people talk international leagues vs college.</p>

<p>A lot of those international teams are led by former NCAA stars. Guys will win MVPs in their NCAA conference, go undrafted, sign internationally and spend years working on their game.</p>

<p>Tyler Harvey was the NCAA scoring leader and Trey Kell was a Mountain West MVP. They&rsquo;re now playing for an NBL team in Australia. They were good by college standards to begin with, they&rsquo;re probably better now after years of professional development.</p>

<p>Yeah and this is pretty common when we talk &ldquo;development&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A lot of people expect rookies to add entire new facets to their game, but that&rsquo;s pretty rare.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown is a good example. He&rsquo;s often touted as someone who built out his game tremendously and added quite a lot.</p>

<p>The pullup and stepback 3s, the post-ups, the transition passing, the shifty in and out drives. Those were all big stepping stones in Brown&rsquo;s career&hellip; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3T-ul7PEsk" target="_blank">But you can see flashes of them in his 10-year-old highschool mixtapes.</a></p>

<p>He did also add a lot to his game, but a lot of his development was just bringing his skills up to NBA standards.</p>

<hr>

<p>With Yabu it&rsquo;s the same.</p>

<p>We drafted him because we liked his potential and we even saw flashes of his potential in Boston, but he wasn&rsquo;t consistent and he wasn&rsquo;t NBA ready.</p>

<p>Philly aren&rsquo;t getting a whole new player, they&rsquo;re getting the Yabusele we were hoping to get.</p>

<p>The NBA is very specific brand of basketball where there&rsquo;s a few stars and then a lotta guys that get told to stand in the corner, knock down this three and then go guard in space on the other end. Guys like Mirotic and Vezenkov are good players that just dont fit this brand of basketball.

<ol>
<li>Players who excel under FIBA rules but not in the NBA.</li>
<li>players that are better overall but failed to navigate how to make a rotation ( aka be a role player or step up when and how a coach wants it even if it is the wrong way to use them</li>
<li>Better Iso players who can&rsquo;t rotate or use spacing  or don&rsquo;t like being outlet or cutters.</li>

<p>4.players just aren&rsquo;t built for early bird practices, 41 away games or can&rsquo;t eat or train to be in peak health all the time.</p>

<p>So when his deal expired he basically became viewed as a higher tiered player. But we wasn&rsquo;t worth that remotely. Truth is a veteran on his last legs or a rookie could do what he did and on a cheap deal.</p>

<p>Players think handles and a bag make you a good player.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s street ball, 1 v 1 shit.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not actual team basketball.  Where you need to check your ego at the door and have an actual understanding of what all 10 players are doing.</p>

<p>AND be fast enough to not get abused.</p>

<p>AND be strong enough to not get abused.</p>

<p>AND be tall/long enough to not get abused.</p>

<p>I would wager that the number of individuals encompassing all of that not already in the NBA is maybe in the low dozens globally, and 90% if them are playing high end Euro ball and don&rsquo;t want to be in the NBA (and the USA).</p>

<p>The actual number of guys better than NBA players and not in the NBA who might even want ot be is probably countable on 1 hand.</p>

      <label for="lsr741o" class="commentText"><p>The NBA is a professional league. Guys are paid to do jobs, and some guys, who are less talented are just better at doing their job.</p>

<p>I am sure many guys outside the NBA are better scorers and iso players than many guys who are in the NBA. But can you defend? Can you rebound? Can you understand an offense? Can you spot up at the 3 line and consistently make 35% of the looks you‚Äôll get? Can you show up to practice and the games on time all the time?</p>

<p>All of that matters. I have firsthand seen NBA players get smoked in places like dyckman, ruckers, drew league etc. by no names. But those guys are one dimensional and can‚Äôt be role players in the NBA. Such is life.</p>
