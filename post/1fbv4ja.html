<p>I&rsquo;d argue that trading for Harden was the real back-breaker.  Because KD &amp; KI specifically wanted to play with that version of the Nets, and they got their wish, minus only DLo who no longer fit, anyway.</p>

<p>It was getting in to a bidding war with Philly for Harden that was the disaster (aside from Kyrie&rsquo;s insanity and KD&rsquo;s inability to lead).  Otherwise we could have taken our shots and traded these two down the road for a big haul, if necessary.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also not forget that it was those two who essentially sabotaged their own stated plan by demanding Harden only 2-3 months in to KD&rsquo;s first season.  Not to mention getting Kenny fired in favor of Nash.</p>

<p>If they could have just played a <em>single season</em> in a good-faith effort and unfortunately come up short, then things would have looked very different from then on.  I.e., they would have had a point in demanding all those changes.  But no&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>The price was just too high for me.  It put the Nets in to a position in which everything needed to align in order to win a chip, with two guys who had serious injury histories, and then a third who started to have injuries in HOU.  So if it works, great, but if not?  Then you&rsquo;ve fucked your draft process and capitol for years &amp; years to come, which we of course did.</p>

<p>But what I said earlier, also.  KD &amp; KI proved to be horrendous leaders with known histories of abandoning their teams.  Marks simply should not have listed to them about trying to pry Harden out of HOU for such an enormous price tag.  Now spending a lesser amount for some other star?  I would have been down with that.</p>

<p>Harden had already passed that point, and see my comment below about the enormous price tag that would have screwed the Nets for most of the succeeding decade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harden had already passed that point&rdquo;</p>

<p>&hellip; Genuinely might be the most revisionist thing I&rsquo;ve ever read on here good job.</p>

<p>Harden had averaged <strong>34.3</strong>/6.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.5 the year prior while playing 68 games and averaged 26/9/11 with us over his first 31 games before he got hurt.</p>

<p>Between Kyrie being a fucking lunatic and just deciding to take time off and KD being hurt that team was doing absolutely nothing without Harden.</p>

He was also beginning to have health problems (which ended up being part of the dismantling of this “super team”). Not only that, but they ended up literally being one of the worst defensive teams of all time and one of the worst rebounding teams of all time, too bad they traded a guy who is elite in both those areas. I guess you could say it was a risk worth taking, but this outcome was extremely easy to predict</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because they handed the keys to the vehicle to KD &amp; KI.  Durant and Jordan were evidently buddys, and it was a total cronyist move.</p>

<p>Fro was right to be pissed, and Marks looked like an absolute fool for enabling those two to the extent he did.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us KD&rsquo;s body managed to last, Ishbia went all-in trading for him, and the Knicks happened to need someone like Bridges.  In the end, Durant wound up accounting for ~90% of the draft capital coming back for the &lsquo;big three.&rsquo;  We are <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> lucky with all that, no matter the rantings of some Nets fans here.</p>

<p>Like yea Kylo was being all weird. Who cares bro, at that level everyone is some level of insane, and it&rsquo;s not like Kyrie&rsquo;s refusal to take the vaccine has harmed him. He played great on Dallas. It was all about the owner getting salty people he was paying weren&rsquo;t listening to him. Might be a cultural difference thing too idk&hellip;</p>
