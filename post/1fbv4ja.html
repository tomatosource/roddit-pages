<p>I&rsquo;d argue that trading for Harden was the real back-breaker.  Because KD &amp; KI specifically wanted to play with that version of the Nets, and they got their wish, minus only DLo who no longer fit, anyway.</p>

<p>It was getting in to a bidding war with Philly for Harden that was the disaster (aside from Kyrie&rsquo;s insanity and KD&rsquo;s inability to lead).  Otherwise we could have taken our shots and traded these two down the road for a big haul, if necessary.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also not forget that it was those two who essentially sabotaged their own stated plan by demanding help only 2-3 months in to KD&rsquo;s first season.  Not to mention getting Kenny fired in favor of Nash.</p>

<p>The price was just too high for me.  It put the Nets in to a position in which everything needed to align in order to win a chip, with two guys who had serious injury histories, and then a third who started to have injuries in HOU.  So if it works, great, but if not?  Then you&rsquo;ve fucked your draft process and capitol for years &amp; years to come, which we of course did.</p>

<p>But what I said earlier, also.  KD &amp; KI proved to be horrendous leaders with known histories of abandoning their teams.  Marks simply should not have listed to them about trying to pry Harden out of HOU for such an enormous price tag.  Now spending a lesser amount for some other star?  I would have been down with that.</p>

<p>Harden had already passed that point, and see my comment below about the enormous price tag that would have screwed the Nets for most of the succeeding decade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harden had already passed that point&rdquo;</p>

<p>&hellip; Genuinely might be the most revisionist thing I&rsquo;ve ever read on here good job.</p>

<p>Harden had averaged <strong>34.3</strong>/6.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.5 the year prior while playing 68 games and averaged 26/9/11 with us over his first 31 games before he got hurt.</p>

<p>Between Kyrie being a fucking lunatic and just deciding to take time off and KD being hurt that team was doing absolutely nothing without Harden.</p>

Admittedly I’m a huge Jarrett Allen fan, but back then I was just like “oh this is more of a circus than a contending NBA team”</p>

<p>Obviously they eventually traded Allen for Harden, the quality of that move is debatable but oh well</p>

      <label for="lm3t5cr" class="commentText"><p>This is the same year that Harden came into the season built like Rick Ross and gave up on even trying to play good basketball. He was also beginning to have health problems (which ended up being part of the dismantling of this “super team”). Not only that, but they ended up literally being one of the worst defensive teams of all time and one of the worst rebounding teams of all time, too bad they traded a guy who is elite in both those areas. I guess you could say it was a risk worth taking, but this outcome was extremely easy to predict</p>

<p>That D’lo led team’s absolute ceiling was a second round exit. Getting KD and Kyrie and eventually Harden made them firm championship favourites and could have been a potential dynasty, or at least perennial contenders for many years.</p>

<p>But KD, Kyrie and Harden had a bunch of unforeseeable and strange drama that was largely due to Covid and other stuff. It didn’t work out but it was undoutedly worth it for the Nets to take the chance.</p>
