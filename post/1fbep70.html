      <label for="lm07r6l" class="commentText"><p>He will get his. He is truly the unsung hero of the team. Can guard anyone from lebron to booker. Has telepathic powers with jokic. And a fan favorite and a good dude in general. Will need to probably move a contract to get it done if the nuggets want to avoid the 2nd apron. I’m guessing MPJ since he will have two years left and is somewhat decent (even though I don’t want to see it happen).</p>

So roughly \)</span>37.5 is the absolute most they can pay him.  We are at the very beginning with the new CBA and I would bet that in the next year or two when more players play out their contract, we are going to see more teams pulling back on what they would spend on second tier players.  If I were playing arm chair GM, I would target about $30 million per year.</p>

<p>He’ll be 30 when the contract kicks in, and he’s mostly an athletic marvel (savvy as a cutter too). He can’t really shoot, and he’s not really a rim protector or a top tier team defender. Once he loses some quickness, his defensive versatility may start to decay.</p>

He’s a great defender lol, one of the best non all D defenders in the league. Epm n shit agree on this too. He’s Denver’s best defender by far even when kcp played , kcp got 25m and isn’t as good as Gordon . Gordon also has a terrific post game attacking mismatch’s and skill finishing . He had a bad year from 3 but hit enough in 23 to help them win .</p>

      <label for="lm0nr5y" class="commentText"><p>Yes, he’s their rim protector, but he’s not an elite one. Denver’s struggled protecting the rim the past few years, and (while an imperfect metric) has only averaged about 0.6 blocks per game in Denver.</p>

<p>He’s not very big or long (only 6’11”) for a PF, let alone a C. He’s solid there because he’s explosive (and smart), but how much of that will fade by 31, 32, 33?</p>

<p>I also never said he wasn’t a great defender: he 100% is. But he’s a great defender in large part because he’s a freak athlete. If he loses a quarter step, will he be able to guard 1s and 2s? We already saw him struggle a lot with Ant in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And finally, he’s okay in the post, but “terrific”? Come on.</p>

<p>I think Murray&rsquo;s health is a huge question mark and not worth the deal given he&rsquo;s going to miss 20+ games a year more often than not. But, as a Wolves fan, I don&rsquo;t mind them pushing that much cash at a guy who has not played a 70 game season since 2019.</p>

That would mean probably punting on this season in which our star player is coming off his third MVP award, can&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s been a rough few months for Murray, but he literally has proved you can win the Finals with him as your second option as recently as last year.</p>

<p>This was the super obvious move for the Nuggets</p>

      <label for="lm01jt5" class="commentText"><p>The bottom line is that Jamal Murray, when healthy, is a #2 option on a title team who sacrifices usage during the regular season BUT has dealt with shin, hamstring, calf and ankle issues since tearing his ACL.</p>

<p>If he had never torn the ACL during his age 23 season, I firmly believe he would be a Donovan Mitchell level player. And he and Jokic are as close of friends as NBA teammates get.</p>

<p>However, I have zero confidence he can stay healthy moving forward, and if he doesn&rsquo;t start taking things like his diet seriously, this contract is gonna age like Brandon Roy.</p>

      <label for="lm13khf" class="commentText"><p>A) The Nuggets have won at a 60 game clip since <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> when Jokic and Murray are both on the court. They have won at like a 45 game clip in that span when he&rsquo;s hurt.</p>

<p>B) The Nuggets play a style of ball that empahsises moving the ball and finding the open man in the regular season. Jamal and Jokic historically only go to the two man game during the clutch in the regular season. In the playoffs, the 2 man game becomes the fulcrum. That&rsquo;s the primary difference.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we will ever see what Jamal was poised to become before the ACL tear. It happened during his age 23 season and in was in the middle of a 3 month run where he was putting up 23/5/6 on 52/45/90&hellip; now, you only get that in glimpses because his lower body is constantly a mess.</p>

<p>But he&rsquo;s still a very good player who, when healthy, elevates the Nuggets to contender status. Or at least did before Booth spent the past year and half making bad move after bad move. Now? Maybe not.</p>

      <label for="lm22hlw" class="commentText"><p>Every single beat reporter around the Nuggets has been talking about Jamal&rsquo;s lack of offseason conditioning for months.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;d argue part of that is due to the fact that he is constantly ending seasons banged up and needing to rest his body. But I&rsquo;m hardly grasping at straws.</p>

<p>Also, there&rsquo;s plenty of science that says part of the reasons athletes are aging better is due to the attention diet is suddenly getting.</p>

      <label for="lm235fx" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s probably not conditioning this off-season for the exact reason you mentioned. He came off a deep playoff run where he was already banged up straight into the Olympics. You can&rsquo;t condition and recover at the same time so he chose rest. Yeah diet is important but choosing him eating some candy and drinking soda as the primary cause for his injury issues when he is a full-time NBA starter with previous severe leg injuries is facepalmingly dumb. Sorry to be rude. I work in physical sciences. He doesn&rsquo;t have injury issues cause he likes sweets buddy</p>

<p>Taking your diet seriously is a PART of being a seriously conditioned athlete. Especially as you hit your late 20&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He also needs to stop the machismo shit of playing through injuries during the regular season. He also needs to come camp in shape for once in his fucking career.</p>

<p>Again, none of this is recent. It&rsquo;s career long habits. Just as the eating candy and drinking soda is an observable, habitual pattern across his career.</p>

<p>Which is why people like Mares and even some national guys who are in the know have been talking about his conditioning. Hell, even high up Nuggets staff said as much in exit interviews.</p>

<p>Everything health and aging can be related to diet. Yes, how you train also matters, but presumably that should be covered considering he&rsquo;s a pro athlete with access to team trainers and whoever else he wants to hire.</p>

<p>The first real team you met since &lsquo;22 sent you home on your homecourt after being up 3-2 and up 20 at half of game 7.
What did your new 200 mil guy do in the second half of game 7 to prevent the breakdown? </p>

<p>The reality is you got lucky 1 year by being healthy and facing injured, historically weak competition. Both these circumstances wont happen again.</p>

      <label for="lm09u9j" class="commentText"><p>People forget that Murray&rsquo;s coming off the best regular season of his career. Yeah, he was awful in the playoffs and the Olympics, but it&rsquo;s unlikely he suddenly forgot to play basketball. His recent play isn&rsquo;t the norm for him, just like his previous amazing playoff performances aren&rsquo;t either. As long as Denver gets something in between, they&rsquo;ll be good to go. Although he definitely feels like one of those players who&rsquo;ll have to sacrifice some of the regular season minutes to be ready and healthy for the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lm05bln" class="commentText"><p>So much about this doesn’t look great. However you don’t maximize Jokic’s prime gambling on your second star on a proven championship squad. Denver had to do it. I just wish this contract created flexibility to get Bruce Brown back. He is missed for a variety of reasons but top is allowing Jamaal to rest while still leaving a scoring threat and leader on the court.</p>

      <label for="lm0g55w" class="commentText"><p>Undersized attacking guards aren&rsquo;t super hard to find. Murray ain&rsquo;t even good. Denver owner really is satisfied with one championship&mdash;not hating Colorado besides their baseball team is spoiled with sports success plus Denver is an amazing city. But Denver fans have to see this right?</p>
