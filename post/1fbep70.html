      <label for="lm07r6l" class="commentText"><p>He will get his. He is truly the unsung hero of the team. Can guard anyone from lebron to booker. Has telepathic powers with jokic. And a fan favorite and a good dude in general. Will need to probably move a contract to get it done if the nuggets want to avoid the 2nd apron. I’m guessing MPJ since he will have two years left and is somewhat decent (even though I don’t want to see it happen).</p>

So roughly \)</span>37.5 is the absolute most they can pay him.  We are at the very beginning with the new CBA and I would bet that in the next year or two when more players play out their contract, we are going to see more teams pulling back on what they would spend on second tier players.  If I were playing arm chair GM, I would target about $30 million per year.</p>

<p>He’ll be 30 when the contract kicks in, and he’s mostly an athletic marvel (savvy as a cutter too). He can’t really shoot, and he’s not really a rim protector or a top tier team defender. Once he loses some quickness, his defensive versatility may start to decay.</p>

He’s a great defender lol, one of the best non all D defenders in the league. Epm n shit agree on this too. He’s Denver’s best defender by far even when kcp played , kcp got 25m and isn’t as good as Gordon . Gordon also has a terrific post game attacking mismatch’s and skill finishing . He had a bad year from 3 but hit enough in 23 to help them win .</p>

      <label for="lm0nr5y" class="commentText"><p>Yes, he’s their rim protector, but he’s not an elite one. Denver’s struggled protecting the rim the past few years, and (while an imperfect metric) has only averaged about 0.6 blocks per game in Denver.</p>

<p>He’s not very big or long (only 6’11”) for a PF, let alone a C. He’s solid there because he’s explosive (and smart), but how much of that will fade by 31, 32, 33?</p>

<p>I also never said he wasn’t a great defender: he 100% is. But he’s a great defender in large part because he’s a freak athlete. If he loses a quarter step, will he be able to guard 1s and 2s? We already saw him struggle a lot with Ant in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And finally, he’s okay in the post, but “terrific”? Come on.</p>

<p>I think Murray&rsquo;s health is a huge question mark and not worth the deal given he&rsquo;s going to miss 20+ games a year more often than not. But, as a Wolves fan, I don&rsquo;t mind them pushing that much cash at a guy who has not played a 70 game season since 2019.</p>

      <label for="lm04wmg" class="commentText"><p>So you&rsquo;re acknowledging that we would not get something as good as Murray back for Murray, and we&rsquo;d have to plan for a future move to get who knows a mystery player. That would mean probably punting on this season in which our star player is coming off his third MVP award, can&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s been a rough few months for Murray, but he literally has proved you can win the Finals with him as your second option as recently as last year.</p>

<p>This was the super obvious move for the Nuggets</p>

      <label for="lm01jt5" class="commentText"><p>The bottom line is that Jamal Murray, when healthy, is a #2 option on a title team who sacrifices usage during the regular season BUT has dealt with shin, hamstring, calf and ankle issues since tearing his ACL.</p>

<p>If he had never torn the ACL during his age 23 season, I firmly believe he would be a Donovan Mitchell level player. And he and Jokic are as close of friends as NBA teammates get.</p>

<p>However, I have zero confidence he can stay healthy moving forward, and if he doesn&rsquo;t start taking things like his diet seriously, this contract is gonna age like Brandon Roy.</p>

<p>Everything health and aging can be related to diet. Yes, how you train also matters, but presumably that should be covered considering he&rsquo;s a pro athlete with access to team trainers and whoever else he wants to hire.</p>

      <label for="lm08o3x" class="commentText"><p>How many Games has he missed the last 5 seasons? </p>

<p>&lsquo;20 - 23 </p>

<p>&lsquo;21 - 34</p>

<p>&lsquo;22 - 82</p>

<p>&lsquo;23 - 17</p>

<p>&lsquo;24 - 23</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s 179 out of 410 - 44% yikes</p>

<p>He also missed the &lsquo;21 + &lsquo;22 playoffs. Another 15 Games that potentially cost at least 1 Championship.</p>

<p>So the Nuggets essentially pay that guy to play 45 Games a seasons and have a 60% chance he is available in the playoffs! </p>

<p>Yikes</p>

<p>So yes, the question is health and it&rsquo;s very real. But <em>when</em> he is healthy, he is good enough to be the #2.</p>

<p>How are you getting that #2 to DENVER if you let him walk?</p>

<p>There’s no way to get a replacement as good as Murray, and you can’t afford to take a step back.</p>

      <label for="lm09u9j" class="commentText"><p>People forget that Murray&rsquo;s coming off the best regular season of his career. Yeah, he was awful in the playoffs and the Olympics, but it&rsquo;s unlikely he suddenly forgot to play basketball. His recent play isn&rsquo;t the norm for him, just like his previous amazing playoff performances aren&rsquo;t either. As long as Denver gets something in between, they&rsquo;ll be good to go. Although he definitely feels like one of those players who&rsquo;ll have to sacrifice some of the regular season minutes to be ready and healthy for the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lm05bln" class="commentText"><p>So much about this doesn’t look great. However you don’t maximize Jokic’s prime gambling on your second star on a proven championship squad. Denver had to do it. I just wish this contract created flexibility to get Bruce Brown back. He is missed for a variety of reasons but top is allowing Jamaal to rest while still leaving a scoring threat and leader on the court.</p>
