</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Many Mavs fans and Mark Cuban himself to this day still complain about how the 2006 finals against the Miami Heat were officiated, and how Dwyane Wade got all sorts of favorable whistles in particular games that perhaps ultimately won them the series. But Mark Cuban has admitted on the record that he was a major factor behind rule changes to open up offense more favorable to star perimeter players: <a href="https://blogmaverick.com/2009/02/04/if-its-not-broke-doesnt-mean-its-optimal-even-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">https://blogmaverick.com/2009/02/04/if-its-not-broke-doesnt-mean-its-optimal-even-in-the-nba/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>So a few years ago, Im watching the Pistons beat the Lakers in the Finals.  I’m seeing Larry Brown’s Pistons fully take advantage of the rules. It was impossible to stay in front of Kobe. He could get anywhere he wanted on the court. The Pistons knew it as well.  So every time he tried to get to the basket, they would body up and bump him. The officials did just as they were supposed to. Since Kobe had the advantage on the defender, they didn’t call a foul. However that little bump slowed Kobe down just enough that it gave Ben Wallace a split second more to on a pre rotation to the Paint, to be in a better position to defend the basket. Kobe still scored, but not quite as often as he may have otherwise.</p>

<p>At that point it dawned on me that the concept of playing the advantage in a one on one matchup had nothing to do with which TEAM gained the advantage. After all, its the team that scores the most points that wins. Detroit had a brilliant strategy and was playing it to perfection.  <strong>After the finals, I sat down with the league and discussed with them the difference between player and team advantage.  The discussion lead to changing the rules so that perimeter contact was called far more often</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what gives, if this is actually true, why did Mark Cuban hire an FBI investigator on the referees after losing the &lsquo;06 finals? As a neutral observer at the time, Wade might have gotten favorable whistles but he was genuinely getting hacked on driving plays. Dallas was also the worst interior defense that Miami had played all playoffs and they made the unwise decision of doubling Shaq all series, therefore letting Wade slash through them like butter. It&rsquo;s their fault that they blew a 2-0 series lead and there&rsquo;s other factors to point to as well</p>

<p>Should Mavs fans stop crying and saying &ldquo;Fuck D-Wade&rdquo; after getting beaten by him 18 years ago? The Heat aren&rsquo;t exactly the most well liked team in the basketball world so many people follow in the same footsteps and shout conspiracy</p>
