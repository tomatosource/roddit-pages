I hated that warriors team but klay was elite in defense and could guard most 1-4 without assistance.</p>

<p>It was also in the era of moving screens so it wasn’t hard to get a switch because players practically gave up screens because you got dudes out there doing two handed football blocks while moving so it was pointless to fight through. It’s what made me hate the warriors cause they benefited most from bogut’s and draymond’s bullshit screens when theybhad arguably two of the top five 3 point shooters on the court.</p>

Steals and blocks aren&rsquo;t the be all end all of defense but Klay wasn&rsquo;t particularly impressive at getting either. Klay wasn&rsquo;t easy to blow by and held up well in the post but he just wasn&rsquo;t a very disruptive defender. He didn&rsquo;t pressure the ball, break up passes or protect the rim. I think Klay was a very good defender who gets overrated because he played on a historic team.</p>

      <label for="ll89tst" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous.  Gravity and moving well without the ball made him 2nd behind Curry or 3rd behind Durant in their peak years 2015-2018. The fact that he was also a plus defender during that time just sealed it.</p>

<p>Draymond is probably the most overrated player I&rsquo;ve ever heard of.  He was undoubtedly a good defender but was a negative offensive player and played for one of only two teams who likely could have accommodated him and still been a contender (the other being the Spurs, while their window was open).  </p>

<p>Like nobody gave a shit about Draymond when preparing for the Warriors, other than maybe a line item on the scouting report that says &ldquo;leave open on the perimeter&rdquo; and another that said &ldquo;will turn the ball over often when trying to playmake against aggressive defenses&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And honestly the fact that sucker-punched his own teammate, and generally played dirty with all the kicking and choking and intentionally trying to injure people and all that shit should probably disqualify him from any serious career accolades.</p>

<p>If you removed Draymond and replaced him with nothing, you are right GS are not winning as many titles. However if you replaced him with another defender, they would. Of the four best players GS had during the run, he was easiest to swap.</p>

<p>He is not a HOF caliber player. He might get in due to his popularity + GS dynasty, but on skills alone there are dozens more deserving.</p>

<p>How would you put Draymond Green over Tom Chambers? Who has 13,000 more points and 1000 more rebounds. Chauncy Billups or Horace Grant, who was Draymond before Draymond except better and a four time NBA champion. More points, more rebounds, more blocks, and four time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls.</p>

<p>The fact this is downvoted is insane. If anyone who builds a team takes Draymond over Horace Grant&hellip;.It just tells me they are new to basketball.</p>

<p>Yet he only won one DPOY.  Being a great defender alone doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the HOF.  Look at Camby and Mark Eaton.  Other HOF defenders were great rebounders, but Draymond wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Draymond Green has assists, but that&rsquo;s due to playing alongside Curry and Thompson.  He wouldn&rsquo;t have that on a different team.</p>

<p>You need to consider context.</p>

<p>But also, I&rsquo;m talking about HOF candidacy.  Being an elite defender alone isn&rsquo;t enough to make it to the HOF.</p>

      <label for="ll873b5" class="commentText"><p>Horace Grant had a much easier job than Draymond. You can argue he&rsquo;s better than Draymond&ndash;though &ldquo;more points&rdquo; kind of misses the, uh, point&ndash;and you can argue he should be in the Hall. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean Draymond shouldn&rsquo;t be. Green has a DPOY, 4 All-Star games to Grant&rsquo;s 1, 4 All-Defensive first team and 2 All-NBA honors to Grant&rsquo;s 0&hellip;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I loved watching Grant. But Draymond&rsquo;s received more recognition during his career than Grant did, and that counts in an HOF discussion.</p>

      <label for="ll8gwsg" class="commentText"><p>Larry Bird was a better playmaker than anyone Hakeem consistently had and got McHale so many easy looks because of it. He hit McHale on a ton of his off-ball curls, pick and rolls, backdoors, while drawing help in the lane, lobs over defenders fronting in the post. And Dennis Johnson was no slouch as a playmaker, either.</p>

<p>The best Hakeem got was one good year of Clyde Drexler in 95 at the tail end of both of their primes.</p>

<p>In 94 Hakeem was the leader in assists for the Rocket&rsquo;s playoff run, well as leading in pretty much everything else. He practically had to be the Rocket&rsquo;s whole system as a playmaker, scorer and defender.</p>

<p>McHale had the benefit of playing with an All-time playmaker/scorer in Bird and other great 2-way players for that era (Parish and DJ in particular). He never had to take on the same offensive and defensive load as Hakeem.</p>

Also, you&rsquo;re acting like only Parish&rsquo;s defender could double. There were frequently 3 defenders in the paint in that era and oftentimes the man defending the perimeter player would double as the entrypass came. Doubling McHale wasn&rsquo;t really super effective anyway because he frequently made his move so quickly there wasn&rsquo;t time for a double to come.</p>

      <label for="ll8cybl" class="commentText"><p>Luka&rsquo;s rebounding is not particularly good. Most of them are uncontested, and a lot are the result of him not contesting on the perimeter, which leaves him closer to the hoop to get boards.</p>

<p>If you look at stats his rebounding is impressive, but if you watch him it isn&rsquo;t. And if you look at where he <em>should</em> be on defense it might even transition to bad. He loves to do that thing where he just abandons the guy he&rsquo;s supposed to be guarding to hang out below the hoop, and that shitty defense leads to more rebounds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the Celtics had another impressive post player in 7-foot-1 Robert Parish, the then Golden State’s big man Andrew Bogut would likely take on The Chief while the onus of guarding McHale would fall in the hands of Draymond, who is only 6-6 tall.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. Draymond usually guarded Gasol with Bogut on ZBo. Even in 2015.</p>

      <label for="ll8dij3" class="commentText"><p>That is not correct.  The Grizz were up 2-1, Tony got hurt early in Game 4, tried to play through it, but was ineffective, and missed the rest of the series. </p>

<p>And putting Bogut/nobody on Tony Allen definitely wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;.  It was a surprise in the 2013 conference finals when the Spurs did it, but the Grizz saw some variant of it probably every game during the 14-15 season, and Tony still had probably the best or second best season of his career in terms of on/offs and one number metrics.</p>

<p>I don’t think McHale would like himself more than 2022 Jokic in the matchup.</p>

<p>Further, this was the first video I found so it may not be indicative of the series:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXGC1vVYhRk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXGC1vVYhRk</a></p>

<p>For the vast majority of those plays, Green was not Jokic&rsquo;s primary defender.</p>

<p>In single coverage, I think Green would struggle to guard McHale.</p>

<p>Jokic is much taller than Draymond, and he has a high release point.  Draymond wasn&rsquo;t bothering Jokic&rsquo;s jumper at all.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to keep players off rhythm when they have no help.</p>

<p>so my assumption is they realized if we run through him, it&rsquo;s either a shot or pass out only, and not an assist to a cutter or shooter</p>

<p>because if you look at the duos this year that did it, it&rsquo;s guys who pretty much create for themselves and others</p>

Dray kicks nuts and chokes dudes from behind, but that whole era of basketball broke noses and worse. Teams had <em>enforcers</em> as a player position back then. Dray would get thrashed.</p>

      <label for="ll86a5l" class="commentText"><p>Yeah lot of these comments are from people who don’t watch basketball or don’t like draymond. Dray has definitely held his own against great post players but he’s going to get scored on because he’s 6’6 on a good day. His help/team defense however is one of the best I ever seen along with his communication. Dude is annoying af but he’s one of the greatest defenders of this generation and honestly all time but nobody wants to hear that</p>

You can get in to arguments about if his specific skillset lines up against other ATGs, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that he&rsquo;s a huge difference maker on that side of the court.</p>

<p>No disrespect to Mchale, legend of the low post, godly player prolly would destroy most 1v1. But I would bet 300 bucks that I can find 10 people in here who have never watched more than 45 seconds of mchale saying draymond would get chumped</p>

Dray made a living being stronger and smarter than everyone he was guarding, McHale tho has the moves that counter the defense to the moves, and he was just as much of a prick as Dray.</p>

<p>Dray&rsquo;s &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; 7&rsquo;1&rdquo; wingspan comes up very short to  McHale&rsquo;s 8 fucking foot wingspan and 5 inches of height advantage.</p>

<p>its an oversimplification, but think of today’s post game as being on par with the 80s 3-ball game, maybe even less so.</p>

Dray punches above his weight but McHale is about the gangliest craftiest dude down low to ever lace them up. Would have been interesting but he’s not guarding Frankie 1 on 1 effectively.</p>
