</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Sometimes I wonder how amazing that Wilt and Russell&rsquo;s Legacy are still on the running today.</p>

<p>50s Superstars are forgotten now. A casual nba fan will not know most superstars in 60s like Jerry or Oscar or Bob or Elgin. Unless he/she is interested in Nba history.</p>

<p>Heck, even 70s stars are forgotten now. Except for Kareem. (And Dr. J if you count ABA)</p>

<p>However, Even the most normal fans. Even the younger fans know Wilt and Russell.</p>

<p>I am in my Mid 20s. My father was not even alive when Wilt/Russell played. But I still know them like I know Modern Nba players.</p>

<p>Even after <strong>60 years</strong>, Wilt and Russell&rsquo;s legacy remains to be in the heart and minds of modern people.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Is it just simply because of:</p>

<p>Bill Russell&rsquo;s unbreakable 11 rings as the best player AND  Wilt Chamberlain&rsquo;s 100 points in a game, and 50 ppg in a season?</p>

      <label for="llh3m48" class="commentText"><p>Because Russell is the greatest winning outlier in sports history, and Chamberlain is the greatest statistical outlier in basketball history. A lot of people use them as the baseline to which winning success and individual accomplishments are compared to.</p>

<p>It’s sad that NBA fans - and the NBA itself - value the sport’s history so little compared to other leagues, though. I never see MLB, NFL, etc. fans constantly hate on older eras to the extent NBA fans do.</p>

<p>That’s not the same as 11 in 13 years, plus 5x MVP, of course, but it’s still a wild stat. Especially in a sport where winning is way more random and unpredictable than the NBA.</p>

      <label for="llh6qge" class="commentText"><p>I would argue that the history of the sport is more valued in the NBA than any other American sport.</p>

<p>NFL legends face less disrespect, yes, but they’re also mentioned far less often. A guy like Johnny Unitas is occasionally mentioned now and then and deservingly praised, sure.</p>

<p>But it’s nothing like the amount of discourse surrounds the top 10 contenders like Russell and Wilt.</p>

<p>The obsession with all-time rankings means that the greats hold a greater and more significant place in contemporary discourse. An NBA fan can tell you more about Russell and Wilt than an NFL fan can tell you about Unitas, Jim Brown, Otto Graham. This is a fact.</p>

<p>Also, how often do you hear older players shit talking the modern NFL era and say that it’s easier, modern players wouldn’t survive in the past, etc? Some fans say it but I don’t see it from the players as often as in the NBA. The cross-era comparisons just aren’t as relevant in either direction.</p>

      <label for="llh7gru" class="commentText"><p>I would argue a lot of the NFL’s historical disconnect has to do with the way the league’s infrastructure has evolved, though - the pre-Super Bowl era was very strange in terms of talent distribution, much like the NBA-ABA era.</p>

<p>NBA fans do acknowledge the old-school guys more on average most likely, but they also disrespect them a lot more because the fanbase is younger and the essence of the league is less traditionalist than the NFL.</p>

<p>This also doesn’t account for MLB fans, who are endlessly respectful of the pioneers and hold their records to the same standards they hold current ones to, just with context.</p>

      <label for="llh9cdi" class="commentText"><p>I’m not as big of an MLB fan, so I’m less certain there, but I don’t see much of a difference except for maybe with the Negro League players getting a lot of well-deserved acknowledgement praise today which is great.</p>

<p>But in general if you make all-time comparisons there, I see the same “disrespect” come in. Arguing that players back then were out of shape and pitching was far worse, saying Babe can’t be the GOAT because the league wasn’t integrated, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, as I said NBA legends are acknowledged more and receive more disrespect as part of it. Because they are included as honest parts of modern day discourse. Not cast aside as relics.</p>

<p>Same way you get far more disrespect towards the modern game, which you’re ignoring. There are soooooooo many quotes from past players saying that newer players couldn’t hang in their era, they’re worse, or they’re softer, or the sport has regressed, etc. You are acting as if it this is all one-sided for some reason.</p>

<p>No, NBA history is constantly a part of discourse in a way that no other American sport is.</p>

<p>Maybe some would argue they would rather be Johnny Unitas than Bill Russell. Fraction of the fame, fraction of the lasting power, essentially ignored in current discourse barring some niche conversations. But when you’re mentioned, it’s 99% praise. Or Russell - you’re remembered by more, your achievements are known by more, you’re mentioned by more, but a lower proportion of it is straight praise. I could see arguments both ways, and I do not think it’s fair to frame it as clear cut.</p>

<p>I think Michael Phelps is the greatest winning outlier in sports history. &ldquo;28 medals, including 23 gold medals. Phelps won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which is more than any other athlete in a single Olympics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Russell, however, takes the crown in professional basketball and in team sports. </p>
