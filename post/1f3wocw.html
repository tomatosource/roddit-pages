</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Say you&rsquo;re an NBA scout and you completely saw the potential of all these guys, what player(s) would you have used to make the best comparison of these current players?</p>

<p>Giannis I think is hard to compare, but I based on the limited footage I&rsquo;ve watched of young Shaq and David Robinson. I think back then the scouts tried to sell him as this Magic Johnson/Scottie Pippen hybrid, but he&rsquo;s more similar to a 90s big who feels more comfortable with the ball in his hands in transition.</p>

<p>Jokic is weird because in the halfcourt he plays like if you took away all the athleticism of LeBron James then you get Jokic. Extreme high bball IQ, able to elevate his teammates but also taking over when needed. I think comparing him to other great passing bigs is a bit lazy and selling Jokic short.</p>

<p>SGA I can&rsquo;t think of a direct comparison but I think he perfectly fits the mold of the 00s era wing with amazing 1-on-1 skills. His playstyle is entertaining, overall dominant player.</p>

<p>Anthony Edwards really does feel like watching Michael Jordan a lot of times.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know who I would compare Luka to</p>

      <label for="lkhloys" class="commentText"><p>Jokic is not really anything like Lebron, and I’m not sure we’ve ever actually seen Lebron raise his teammates play the way we have seen Jokic or Chris Paul do. Lebron is ball dominant, Jokic less so, as he is typically not dribbling around the perimeter. </p>

<p>A more apt comparison would be a combination of Dirk and late career Wilt Chamberlain, although that doesn’t even fairly represent him. I want to compare him to Steve Nash, as well, but his style of play is very different.</p>

      <label for="lkhlzba" class="commentText"><p>The best comp for Luka is actually lebron. A PG in a forwards body whose best skill is passing yet he scores a lot too. Due to the step back there&rsquo;s an argument for harden too.</p>

<p>Jokic i guess the original sabonis but I am not old enough to know much about him</p>

      <label for="lkht95d" class="commentText"><p>In the playoffs, SGA&rsquo;s insane mid-range game and ability to get a shot off reminded me of peak Kawhi. Not the same on defense, obviously.</p>

<p>Luka is a lot like Harden, and while not a perfect comparison pre-draft comps are rarely perfect.</p>

<p>Giannis is really tough. I gotta be honest, his build and how he approaches offense reminds me the most of peak Roy Tarpley, but not many of you will know who he is.</p>

<p>Ant reminds me more of T-Mac and Vince Carter than Jordan.</p>
