</a>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5831971/2024/10/10/kyrie-irving-mavericks-interview/" target="_blank">Source</a> (Bold is questions, Italics is conext, Regular is Irving)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The last time I was in this building was at Team USA’s training camp (before the Olympics). I covered it and honestly kept thinking about the fact that you probably should have been there. You’ve fairly pointed out that, in the old days, there was a tryout, and this time around there wasn’t. So what was it like to not be part of that group? With Steph and LeBron and KD, that’s your generation.</strong></p>

<p><em>The national program held tryouts for decades under longtime Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo but shifted to a less stringent system under former NBA player Grant Hill when he assumed the position in April 2021. Not only does Team USA no longer hold tryouts, but also players no longer have to make the three-year commitment to the program that was required under Colangelo.For Irving — who won gold with Team USA at the FIBA Under-18 Americas tournament in 2010, the FIBA World Cup in Spain in 2014 and the Rio Olympics in 2016 — this became a point of contention when he wasn’t selected to the final roster. Add in that Krzyzewski ended his storied 11-year run as Team USA’s head coach after the Rio Olympics, and Irving found himself wondering why he was suddenly on the outside looking in. In the wake of Nike’s decision to end its relationship with Irving five weeks after his October 2022 tweet, he signed a five-year deal with the Chinese shoe company Anta to become a signature athlete and chief creative officer in July 2023.</em></p>

<p>I won’t say it was hurtful not to be able to try out, but it just was weird that we weren’t able to try out and get together as a group because the USA team is not just 12 guys or 15 guys. … I was playing on Team USA when I was 17, 18. I won three gold medals. I won when I was 18, when I was 22, and I won one when I was 24. So there is a pride thing there, and I have history. There was such a great competitive pool that you can test yourself against because it’s the best in the world. It’s not every day you get a chance to go against (players of that caliber).</p>

<p><strong>Iron sharpens iron. That sort of thing?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely. So we got seven days to compete. And even if I don’t make the team, I’m fine with that. But I know that I’m going to leave it out on the line, and I know that I’m one of those players who’s able to…</p>

<p><strong>Be part of a meritocracy?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely. And I’m fine with being able to earn my spot. That’s not a problem. But what I saw from a lot of my other peers is they had more interest than probably they were given credit for. I think the USA committee had a tough decision anyway to shrink down that group.</p>

<p><strong>But did you have any communication with them?</strong></p>

<p>I had communication with Grant throughout the season, but I think it was more or less a surprise that I wanted to play. I think it was just a surprise that I wanted to play and (that) I was engaged. I speak on this from a healthy standpoint, like let me make sure that’s clear too. It wasn’t jealousy. It was like, ‘Oh, OK, this means that there’s an extra motivation, just naturally, where, OK, I guess 2028 (is the plan)?’ And maybe it’s not for Team USA. I’m just really proud of the (Team USA) guys, at the end of the day.</p>

<p><strong>But if not Team USA…</strong></p>

<p>I would love to entertain playing for Team Australia, man.</p>

<p><em>While Irving was born in Melbourne, Australia, and holds dual citizenship, he could only play for the Australian national team if both Team USA and FIBA approved his choice.</em></p>

<p>I don’t think it’s a strong, strong possibility at this point, depending on what the Olympic Committee does. But as a competitor, I was born in Australia. For me, it’s not a hard transition to make, but I don’t want to fall into the same, I would say, probably like — I’m trying to be very intentional with my words here. I don’t want to fall into the trap of being let down or disappointed when I know that there are other opportunities out there for me.</p>

<p><strong>At the end of the day, do you think the Nike backstory was a factor?</strong></p>

<p>I mean (pauses). I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t pinpoint it, because I don’t pay enough attention to Nike at this point or any of those guys. And I love all those guys over there, but it’s always been healthy competition since I left, and they know that. I appreciate that. I just wanted a chance to try out.</p>

<p>Just give me a shot, because that was the culture that was created for us here with USA Basketball, with the original guys from 2008 to 2016. I’m coming underneath the mold of Kobe (Bryant), ‘Bron, J-Kidd. So those guys taught me a lot about just what it means to earn your stock. You’ve got to think, how many All-Stars weren’t on that team when those guys were on it? You’ve got ‘Bron, with D-Wade (Dwyane Wade) coming off the bench, so they taught me how to sacrifice and be selfless if you’re on Team USA. And I think the guys did a great job of that. I don’t think the culture is missing that. I just felt like once things started changing coaching-wise, with Coach K’s last year, it was gonna be a changing of the guard anyway.</p>

<p><strong>So 2028 is on the to-do list?</strong></p>

<p>I’m definitely planning on it for 2028. God willing. I’m healthy, yeah. For sure.</p>

They allowed him to play because it met the criteria of the move being in the best interest of developing basketball internationally.</p>

<p>The only distinction the Bahamas have is one participation at the FIBA Americas 30 years ago, whereas Australia has a long and successful international résumé.</p>

<p>This happens all the time. It just happened twice this year. Paolo with Italy and Embiid with France. Kyrie was born in Australia. I fail to see any issue.</p>

<p>Italy losing Paolo and France losing Embiid is a way bigger deal than USA losing Kyrie who won’t even be a top 10 player for them while Paolo and Embiid would’ve been their best player.</p>

<p>Also, football is not that common, that&rsquo;s fairly new, it hasn&rsquo;t even been 5 years since the rules changed. Also, they have to meet certain criteria.</p>

<p>Kyrie has no ties to Australia other than being born and living there for 2 years, so no memories whatsoever. Also, if this was football, he wouldn&rsquo;t be eligible to change countries since he doesn&rsquo;t meet the criteria:</p>

<p>-He&rsquo;s played after the age of 21 with Team USA</p>

<p>-He&rsquo;s played a final round game of a major tournament (has done this multiple times)</p>
