      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ddfeu7/celtics_incredible_road_stats_since_2122/"><p>Celtics&rsquo; INCREDIBLE Road Stats Since 21-22</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>Full disclosure</strong>:  I am a Celtics fan (and yes, I made this same post over on r/bostonceltics).  However, these are raw stats, they provide some context as the Finals shifts to Dallas, and they&rsquo;re just remarkable numbers that no other team has come close to replicating in recent seasons.</p>

<p>It may be common knowledge that the Celtics are a good road team &ndash; especially in the playoffs, where they seem to be much better on the road than at home. But the numbers are really quite eye-opening when you dig in to them.</p>

<ol>
<li>Boston <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-road-wins-since-2022" target="_blank">has the most regular season road wins in the NBA</a> (75) since the start of the 21-22 season. That translates to about a 50-win pace over an 82 game season. They also have the most road wins <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-road-wins-since-2023" target="_blank">over just the last two seasons</a>.</li>
<li>Boston has, by far, <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-road-playoff-wins-since-2022" target="_blank">the most playoff road wins over the last 3 season</a>s (20). Their 20-7 record away from home is a .740 winning percentage &ndash; roughly a 61-win pace over 82 games. The next best team is Miami, with a record of 12-12. Third place? Dallas (10-11).</li>
<li>Not only does Boston have the most road playoff wins during this stretch, they&rsquo;re one of just three teams to even have a winning record. The others: Denver (9-8) and OKC (3-2).</li>
<li>Even if you were to take away Boston&rsquo;s 6-0 postseason record this season, they&rsquo;d still be 14-7. In other words, if you completely disregarded their road performance this postseason&hellip;<strong><em>they&rsquo;d still have the most road playoff wins and the best road winning percentage out of every team of the last three seasons.</em></strong></li>
<li>On that note, if you just <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-playoff-road-wins-since-2023" target="_blank">consider the last two postseasons</a>, Boston&rsquo;s road numbers are even more ridiculous: they&rsquo;re 12-3 on the road &ndash; an 80% win rate. That equates to about 66 wins over a full season.</li>
<li>Going back to the start of the 21-22 playoffs, Boston <strong><em>has won at least one road game in every single series</em></strong> (bar the Finals vs. Dallas, in which they have obviously yet to play a road game). Here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</li>
</ol>

<p>22 v Brooklyn: 2-0 on the road</p>

<p>22 v Milwaukee: 2-1</p>

<p>22 v Miami: 3-1</p>

<p>22 v Golden State: 1-2</p>

<p>23 v Atlanta: 2-1</p>

<p>23 v Philadelphia: 2-1</p>

<p>23 v Miami: 2-1</p>

<p>And then 2-0 against each of Miami, Cleveland, and Indiana this postseason</p>

<ol>
<li>As the above shows, not only has Boston won at least one road game in every series, they&rsquo;ve actually had a <strong><em>winning road record in every series except for the 22 Finals</em></strong>. On a personal note, this one is particularly bonkers to me.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this is to say, recent history suggests it will be very difficult for Dallas to win both game 3 and game 4.</p>

      <label for="l85bonc" class="commentText"><p>I will say, it&rsquo;s felt a bit different this year.  Teams make runs.  That&rsquo;s inevitable, especially so in today&rsquo;s NBA.  For whatever reason, the team&rsquo;s mindset now is more along the lines of &ldquo;accept the run is happening, fight through it, and respond&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Oh god no, they&rsquo;re making a run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>More often than not, this version of the Celtics tends to answer an opponent&rsquo;s run with one of their own.  That&rsquo;s exactly what happened in game 1.</p>

      <label for="l85ahnc" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Boston sports fans are just a nervous bunch. I honestly think it goes back to the Red Sox curse, which obviously ended awhile ago, but those 86 years were filled with &ldquo;near misses&rdquo; (as opposed to just being trash), and that really instilled a deep culture of &ldquo;we&rsquo;re gonna fuck it up&rdquo; in the fans. Even despite the success of so many Boston teams in the last two decades, that culture is still pervasive.</p>

<p>I can imagine if I was born like 5 years later and my earliest sports memories are just winning all the time, I would look at my dad&rsquo;s negativity like he&rsquo;s crazy. But I got to witness why he was like that lol. That 2003 Aaron Boone homerun scarred me, that was when I was like holy fuck he&rsquo;s right to be like this.</p>
