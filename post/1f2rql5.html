      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f2rql5/the_pistons_could_be_way_better_than_last_year/"><p>The Pistons could be way better than last year.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Significantly in this case meaning they could win 32 games but even that&rsquo;s optimistic, expecting an 18 game swing out of that team is optimistic, but I do really believe that they can.</p>

<p>The Pistons had zero spacing last year and Cade struggled mightily for it, but I have to say that he handled it as well as you could as a leader for a team as bad as that year&rsquo;s Pistons, but in theory, Harris, THJ, and Beasley should be able to make up for it and he&rsquo;ll have a much better season.</p>

<p>Call those three chuckers or trash, they can at least play semi-competently over the course of a season, which should help spread the floor. The thought there is that one of Beas or THJ would try to prove themselves to be valuable to a contender and try to get themselves traded, while Tobi just chases the bag wherever it may be.</p>

<p>All the players that are part of that team&rsquo;s future have a chance to improve to some degree, at least enough so that they don&rsquo;t lose games just be existing on the basketball court. But the biggest culprits of that are gone, thankfully.</p>

<p>JB Bickerstaff is good at helming rebuilds and his time in the doldrums of Cleveland before they got good again shows that you can count on him to care about the team more than Monty did.</p>

<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m very optimistic about the Pistons, haven&rsquo;t seen enough or know about Ron Holland to say anything about him but it&rsquo;s only two months until the season starts and we can judge them then.</p>

      <label for="lk8ig3r" class="commentText"><p>I doubt they hit 30 wins unless many thijgs go well for them. Even if this squad is full healthy, 25 wins is attainable for sure but 30 is a bit out of reach.</p>

<p>Their division for the most part isnt exactly worse than last year outside of Chicago. They might be the onoy team they can split a series with. Indiana is better than last year with Siakam for a full year, Milwaukee is mostly the same and Cleveland is as well.</p>

      <label for="lk8j8te" class="commentText"><p>Monty&rsquo;s not coaching them so they should be better. They also got ride of some of their idiot players so they should improve as well on that standpoint.</p>

<p>Tobi is the king of mid so he should raise the floor for the team by default.</p>

<p>30&rsquo;s not unreasonable as a final win tally.</p>

      <label for="lk8z77r" class="commentText"><p>Eh I think Monty got all the blame for that horrific roster construction. He just got done coaching a team that went to the finals then won 60+ games the following season.</p>

<p>If anything he’s a worse Budenholzer but I wouldn’t say he was one of the worst coaches in the league.</p>

      <label for="lk8j3b0" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I heard the same shit last year. THJ is really just this years Alec Burks for them. A guy who will shoot a decent percentage on good volume but take a lot of bad shots and contribute nothing else. I know Mavs fans were thrilled to see him go and Pistons fans will get frustrated with him in no time I promise you. He&rsquo;s not a winning player at all. He&rsquo;s going to be out of the league most likely this time next year. Beasley and Harris are better but Beasley is totally one dimensional and Harris doesn&rsquo;t shoot the 3 ball at enough volume to be a legit spacer although he is definitely more versatile. I see the Pistons winning around 20 games which is an improvement but there&rsquo;s no way they get over 30 or even close to 30.</p>

      <label for="lk8nwql" class="commentText"><p>I agree with most of what you said on THJr, I&rsquo;ve asked how big of an impact will THJ and Beasley be vs Bogey and Burks, but the biggest improvement will likely be Simone Fontecchio for 70 games vs 15, Tobias Harris at the 4, and having those two 3/4s allow us to play Beef Stew in his actual position and takes away what Wiseman was playing last year. This gives us a rotation of Stew, Duren, and Reed.</p>

<p>Our 3-4-5 position is actually where we will see improvement, not in the backcourt.</p>

Think they’re still behind teams like the Rockets and the Raptors but they can hopefully still be better than last season. I wouldn’t hold my breath tho</p>

      <label for="lk8klwc" class="commentText"><p>I do like their moves this offseason. IMO they&rsquo;re going to be in the mix with a bunch of other teams at the trade deadline (Charlotte, Chicago, Toronto, maybe Atlanta but right now I have them a tier above), where they are close enough to make a push for the play-in, or tank for a 3-5 lottery-seed. I&rsquo;m really curious to see how those teams navigate that if they do end up there&hellip; it might be really tempting for Detroit to make a little bit of a push to get a taste of meaningful basketball (no crazy trades, but maybe a couple more low-cost vets).</p>

      <label for="lk8mbup" class="commentText"><p>Ok, say we&rsquo;re at 20-40 after 60 games. That&rsquo;s optimistic, but not unfathomable, right? Now consider that we will have 0 incentive to try for wins at that point late in the season with a great draft class incoming. Time of the year tanking teams bench guys and go 4-18 to finish.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I see happening with us. 30 wins IF the team really tried for it, but likely closer to 25 with Cooper Flagg in mind.</p>

      <label for="lk97hjm" class="commentText"><p>The reason as to why the Pistons were losing more than expected last year were mostly injuries. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what the spacing or coaching looks like if your key players are in and out of the lineup for various reasons. Most notably shooting and rebounding. I know it&rsquo;s the pistons so I doubt anyone watched the games, but OP reads like someone who didn&rsquo;t watch the Pistons. Not saying you will be wrong, but I wouldn&rsquo;t hold my breath for anything in Detroit.</p>

      <label for="lk9j1ci" class="commentText"><p>I agree, but here&rsquo;s a pessimistic take:</p>

<p>Of the five guys that need the most playing time, three can&rsquo;t shoot at all (Duren, Thompson, Holland) and the other two have some questions about their 3pt shot (Ivey and Cunningham).</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t watch him last year, but before then  had a problem with speed, basically, he would take too long to make decisions (pass or shoot). This makes him less of a true spacer, since defenses have extra time to close out. This is part of the Sixers previous spacing issues: he shot at a decent percentage, but it didn&rsquo;t actually help their space as much as you&rsquo;d expect.</p>

<p>My expectation is they are better than last year, then shamelessly tank to an awful record anyway starting in January.</p>
