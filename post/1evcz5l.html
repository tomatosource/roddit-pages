      <p>Bam : 436 career blocks, including 66 last year. 436 + 66 = 502 career blocks at the end of the &lsquo;25 season if he has 66 blocks again this year</p>

<p>Wemby : 254 blocks as rookie. 254 + 254 = 508 career blocks at the end of the &lsquo;25 season if he has 254 blocks again this year</p>

<p>I know shotblocking isn&rsquo;t the main thing Bam does defensively but this is still a pretty wild stat to me.</p>

      <label for="liqq2r4" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d hope he&rsquo;s better, he&rsquo;s in his prime whereas Wemby was a rookie.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;s actually a better rebounder though.</p>

<p>The actual numbers were really close(19.2 vs 17.4 TRB%), and that&rsquo;s despite it being harder for Wemby to rebound when he&rsquo;s also being a shot blocker vs. Sabonis who isn&rsquo;t providing much rim deterrence at all by comparison and can focus on staying in position to grab the board.</p>

<p>Wemby also wasted a lot of his season at PF. When he played C, their DReb per-100 possessions was essentially identical(13.6 for Sabonis v. 13.5 for Wemby).</p>

<p>Wemby&rsquo;s matching his defensive rebounding while blocking shots at historic rates - I&rsquo;d argue that the reasonable conclusion there is that he&rsquo;s actually the <em>better</em> rebounder of the two. At minimum, you&rsquo;d have to say it&rsquo;s too close to call.</p>

<p>Sabonis&rsquo; real edge is in his passing. Wemby&rsquo;s a good passer, but he&rsquo;s not at Sabonis&rsquo; level yet</p>

      <label for="liqru0f" class="commentText"><p>Not sure where you&rsquo;re getting your stats. Basketball Reference has Sabonis at 21.4% TRB% compared to Wemby&rsquo;s 19.4%. The differential is about the same as your numbers, but I&rsquo;m just referencing that for clarity.</p>

<p>Sabonis is definitely not blocking shots as I mentioned earlier, but he is actually a solid rim deterrence. I know that the prevailing opinion is that the Kings got no defense, but check out the defense stats. Kings were the best rebounding team in the league mostly because of 1 guy, and our opponents were not actually scoring much in the paint, as the Kings were right in the middle in terms of opponent paint points. That doesn&rsquo;t happen if Sabonis just stops trying at protecting the rim.</p>

<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too close to call. I think Sabonis is a better board man right now. I&rsquo;m not betting against Wemby next season though.</p>

      <label for="liqu8y7" class="commentText"><p>Different sources have different numbers, especially when it comes to rates. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter as long as your consistent with the same source for each guy since, as you can see, the difference is basically identical.</p>

<p>Sabonis is an awesome rebounder, I&rsquo;ll never deny that. He&rsquo;s probably top-5 in the league in this regard. I think it&rsquo;s pretty biased to think he&rsquo;s definitely better than Wemby though. The numbers are very close, and even if you think Sabonis is a rim deterrent, he&rsquo;s nowhere near the rim deterrent that Wemby is and you can surely agree to that.</p>

<p>Additionally, there&rsquo;s the basic fact of how you&rsquo;re protecting the rim. It&rsquo;s much easier to grab the rebound when you&rsquo;re ground-bound versus when you&rsquo;re leaping to block the shot.</p>

<p>For the numbers to be so close despite Sabonis have a clear contextual advantage means, imo, that at minimum it should be too close to call. I think that&rsquo;s the fair take on this situation.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter much, you&rsquo;re entitled to rocking with your guy, I just don&rsquo;t agree with it.</p>

      <label for="liqv57c" class="commentText"><p>And you too. I think we&rsquo;ve said all that needs to be said, but I do want to take note and mention 1 more contextual difference, since you brought up Sabonis&rsquo; contextual advantage. Sabonis is 6&rsquo;11&rdquo; with T-Rex arms. Last I heard, his wingspan was just barely 7&rsquo;. Wemby is 7&rsquo;5&rdquo; with an 8&rsquo; wingspan.</p>

<p>In theory, it should be ridiculously easy for Wemby to grab boards over everyone else on the floor. That&rsquo;s a contextual advantage Wemby has over most bigs. But somehow, someway, Sabonis still grabs the ball. He&rsquo;s not Rodman or anything, but he certainly is overcoming a contextual disadvantage. And I guess that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll leave it. I agree with most of what you&rsquo;ve said, but I obviously disagree with some parts too!</p>

      <label for="lirk25g" class="commentText"><p>Yes, Victor should have a easy time Grabbing rebounds. Which is why he&rsquo;s still grading out like one of the best rebounders in the league, despite, like the other guy said, him functioning as a much much higher usage, shop locker and overall defensive presence then sabonis or really most of the guys who are high rebounding players.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason he&rsquo;s considered one of the best young players in NBA history. He has advantages and special attributes that no one else can really compare to.</p>

<p>Sabonis Is an awesome rebounder who deserves his flowers in that regard, considering his lack of verticality, and length. But I agree with the other guy. I wouldn&rsquo;t call him a significantly or clearly better rebounder than Vic. I think it&rsquo;s a wash when all is said and done For all of the reasons that have already been mentioned.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sabondo01.html" target="_blank">Sabonis</a> - 82 assists his rookie year (2016-17)</p>

<p>Sabonis doesn&rsquo;t pass 274 assists in a year until his fourth year (2019-20), though that&rsquo;s not super fair to him because he&rsquo;s not playing full-time starter minutes until then (his rookie year with OKC he starts 66 games, but only plays 20.1 mpg).</p>

<p>AD was a guard until he just grew rapidly.  So that&rsquo;s probably why he&rsquo;s so damn coordinated for his size and length</p>

<p>However, typically all great defenders throughout NBA history rack up steals and blocks. Those statements are not the same. </p>

<p>There are exceptions though like Bam. I guess Draymond too. But it’s rare. Usually if you are a great defender in NBA history, you naturally get blocks and steals from just being in the right position, even if you aren’t going for them. </p>

      <label for="liqizy3" class="commentText"><p>The thing is, I feel like Wemby&rsquo;s block rate will slowly decline because people will start to wisen up to his immense range.</p>

<p>This rookie year, everyone obviously knew he was lanky, but it&rsquo;s one thing to see it and another to play against it.</p>

<p>I think Wembys length will turn him more into like AD, where they try to pull him away from the rim and action lessening his block attempts overall.</p>

<p>Then again, that being said, I have no idea how good Wemby is as an offball defender. So he may very well be capable of doing what D-Wade and Matisse Thybulle did quite often and get quite a few blocks from behind.</p>

<p>Players clearly still aren’t used to him even after a full season and breaking down tape etc. He just moves very unusually for someone of that size and length. You just don’t think he can quite get there in time but he does.</p>

He was doing 20 a night for a lot of the games early in the season, but he eventually worked his way to 30 a night. I did not watch 99% of his games, but I do remember a lot of people noticing that his cardio was bad earlier in the season.

Like I said, I&rsquo;m aware of the position change, but I think it mostly had to do with just playing more minutes more often as the season went on.</p>

      <label for="liqy6o6" class="commentText"><p>His first 20 games he averaged 30.2mpg</p>

<p>The rest of the season he averaged 29.4mpg. His minutes actually went down.</p>

<p>His last 20 games of the year, he did average an increased minutes at 32.6mpg.</p>

<p>That being said, we are talking about just a 2.4mpg gap between how his season started and how it ended. This, especially in regards to a stat with numbers as small as bpg, is nearly irrelevant.</p>

<p>He averaged 4.4bpg in 32.6 minutes at the end of the year compared to 2.7bpg in 30.2mpg at the beginning. The driver of this change is obviously not mpg, it&rsquo;s his change in position where we can clearly see he blocked shots at roughly 1.8x the rate at C as he did at PF.</p>

      <label for="lir0az6" class="commentText"><p>Those are fairly arbitrary lines to the game log.</p>

<p>Other than a blowout loss to the Phoenix, Wemby played well over 30 a night from game #53 to his final game. Most of his heaviest minutes came in that final stretch of the season. Compare that to his middle season stretch where he was a full-time C, but still played 20 or so minutes a night a lot more often.</p>

<p>When you compare that stretch to his final stretch, and when you remember that Zach Collins was a non-factor in either stretches, it&rsquo;s easy to see how Wemby&rsquo;s BPG could improve as the season goes on.</p>

The only way I see a player &ldquo;adjusting&rdquo; to his length is to just straight up not shoot the ball when he&rsquo;s closely defending. I&rsquo;m so jealous of Spurs fans who have had 30+ years of HoF players, lol.</p>

<p>Then as they age and players wise up to their range/length the blocks go down a bit, but the overall defensive impact increases a ton.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious about Wemby just because he&rsquo;s sooo long and teams aren&rsquo;t going to stop what they&rsquo;re doing on offense specifically for him&hellip; yet.</p>

<p>Braun got clowned for skipping the layup but I think he made the right play. I&rsquo;m very confident Wemby was going to make the block.</p>

I don&rsquo;t remember where, but I saw a stats that said he blocked almost 50% of the shots he actually contested at the rim, which weren&rsquo;t many, cause they didn&rsquo;t try him that much.</p>

<p>Also, he&rsquo;s gonna get better. All the players he faced for the first time, as time goes on he&rsquo;ll know more. </p>

<p>And, finally, how many attempt will we see from players just trying to score on him cause they want a highlight ? We&rsquo;ve already seen it. I don&rsquo;t remember which Toronto player got blocked, tried again, got blocked again, really seemed like he had tunnel vision and just wanted to get Wemby&hellip;</p>

Players have talked about how they&rsquo;ll put up a short range shot, and Wemby will come out of nowhere and stuff it.  If you can watch the vid of all his blocks.  Trae Young probably has PTSD from all the floaters he had swatted.</p>

<p>Most importantly, just the fact that he&rsquo;s on the floor affects the game, because players have to be cognizant of where he is anytime they get close to the paint.</p>

Almost all other great rim protectors get a ton of blocks (although not the other way around). Bam is super unique in that regard because players like Wemby, Gobert, JJJ, Lopez, AD, etc. rack up a ton of blocks. </p>

<p>Honestly, I can’t think of another great rim protector on the level of Bam who had fewer blocks in NBA history. I’ll have to look it up but off the top of my head he’s probably one of the most unique rim protectors ever. </p>

Draymond Green too, though rim protection wasn&rsquo;t the thing he was best at I&rsquo;d still say he was elite in his defensive prime. An amazing help defender. Also, Giannis surprisingly doesn&rsquo;t get a ton of blocks but he&rsquo;s always been a great defender</p>

<p>But you are right that there probably isn&rsquo;t any great rim protector with fewer blocks than Bam. Definitely a unique defensive beast</p>

      <label for="liqvhi6" class="commentText"><p>You are right they didn’t rack up a lot of blocks but I think all averaged like roughly 1.5 BPG in their prime years when they were winning DPOY. Those 3 were definitely more than about getting blocks so I agree with your general sentiment. </p>

<p>The shocking thing about Bam is he’s not even averaging 1 BPG. To me, that’s super surprising given his field goal percentage allowed is one of the best. </p>

<p>If I didn’t look at Bam’s stats, I would have guessed he was on Gasol’s level where he isn’t an elite shot blocker but could at least get around 1.5 BPG but I look it up and it’s 0.9 BPG last season. </p>

      <label for="liqy7z2" class="commentText"><p>Right that makes a lot of sense to me. The thing I remember most about Bam is that ridiculous block on Tatum, one of the best blocks ever. So I’m sure he could get more blocks if the schemes were different, but it makes sense the coaching might not want him to do that since it would hurt the team. </p>

      <label for="lirfe12" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Bam is definitely an anomaly! They were around 1-1.5. Bam averaging less than 1 while being an elite rim protector is definitely noteworthy.</p>

<p>I just hate when people only look at blocks as &ldquo;rim protection,&rdquo; especially when there&rsquo;s been a bunch of average at best defenders that got a lot of blocks or steals.</p>

<p>Imo, Wizards Javale and young DeAndre Jordan come to mind when I&rsquo;m thinking of some big shot blockers that were bad defenders. And then for steals, it&rsquo;s a lot more common.</p>

      <label for="lir0raw" class="commentText"><p>His field goal percentage allowed on contested shots at the rim is one of the best in the league. At one point, it was number 1 last year among all players (went down a bit) but it’s always excellent and better than many players with way more blocks. </p>

<p>To me, that stat is definitely a sign he’s a good rim protector even though he doesn’t do it through blocks.</p>

<p>Also to be clear, Wemby is a better rim protector so not trying to argue those 2 but Bam isn’t bad either among top NBA players. </p>

Wemby&rsquo;s rim deterrence is otherworldly, and he arguably had the greatest shot blocking season of all-time when you factor in his all-time block:foul ratio.</p>

<p>Bam on the other hand is the pinnacle of modern versatility blending absurdly good switching with the strength to still hang in the post or at the rim, even if he&rsquo;s not actually blocking the shot</p>

<p>I didn’t realize Bam’s shot blocking numbers were so low. It doesn’t make me think less of him as a defender, just interesting.</p>

<p>For comparison, Derrick White and Bam came into the league in the same year and it’s fairly close for them. 366 for White and 436 for Bam.</p>
