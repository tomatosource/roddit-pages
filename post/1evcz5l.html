    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Bam : 436 career blocks, including 66 last year. 436 + 66 = 502 career blocks at the end of the &lsquo;25 season if he has 66 blocks again this year</p>

<p>Wemby : 254 blocks as rookie. 254 + 254 = 508 career blocks at the end of the &lsquo;25 season if he has 254 blocks again this year</p>

<p>I know shotblocking isn&rsquo;t the main thing Bam does defensively but this is still a pretty wild stat to me.</p>

      <label for="liqq2r4" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d hope he&rsquo;s better, he&rsquo;s in his prime whereas Wemby was a rookie.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;s actually a better rebounder though.</p>

<p>The actual numbers were really close(19.2 vs 17.4 TRB%), and that&rsquo;s despite it being harder for Wemby to rebound when he&rsquo;s also being a shot blocker vs. Sabonis who isn&rsquo;t providing much rim deterrence at all by comparison and can focus on staying in position to grab the board.</p>

<p>Wemby also wasted a lot of his season at PF. When he played C, their DReb per-100 possessions was essentially identical(13.6 for Sabonis v. 13.5 for Wemby).</p>

<p>Wemby&rsquo;s matching his defensive rebounding while blocking shots at historic rates - I&rsquo;d argue that the reasonable conclusion there is that he&rsquo;s actually the <em>better</em> rebounder of the two. At minimum, you&rsquo;d have to say it&rsquo;s too close to call.</p>

<p>Sabonis&rsquo; real edge is in his passing. Wemby&rsquo;s a good passer, but he&rsquo;s not at Sabonis&rsquo; level yet</p>

      <label for="liqru0f" class="commentText"><p>Not sure where you&rsquo;re getting your stats. Basketball Reference has Sabonis at 21.4% TRB% compared to Wemby&rsquo;s 19.4%. The differential is about the same as your numbers, but I&rsquo;m just referencing that for clarity.</p>

<p>Sabonis is definitely not blocking shots as I mentioned earlier, but he is actually a solid rim deterrence. I know that the prevailing opinion is that the Kings got no defense, but check out the defense stats. Kings were the best rebounding team in the league mostly because of 1 guy, and our opponents were not actually scoring much in the paint, as the Kings were right in the middle in terms of opponent paint points. That doesn&rsquo;t happen if Sabonis just stops trying at protecting the rim.</p>

<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too close to call. I think Sabonis is a better board man right now. I&rsquo;m not betting against Wemby next season though.</p>

      <label for="liqizy3" class="commentText"><p>The thing is, I feel like Wemby&rsquo;s block rate will slowly decline because people will start to wisen up to his immense range.</p>

<p>This rookie year, everyone obviously knew he was lanky, but it&rsquo;s one thing to see it and another to play against it.</p>

<p>I think Wembys length will turn him more into like AD, where they try to pull him away from the rim and action lessening his block attempts overall.</p>

<p>Then again, that being said, I have no idea how good Wemby is as an offball defender. So he may very well be capable of doing what D-Wade and Matisse Thybulle did quite often and get quite a few blocks from behind.</p>

<p>Players clearly still aren’t used to him even after a full season and breaking down tape etc. He just moves very unusually for someone of that size and length. You just don’t think he can quite get there in time but he does.</p>

      <label for="liqka3i" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t see that happening. The kid can seemingly be completely out of the play, then pin a shot on the backboard. He can get blown by on the 3 point line and recover to block a shot. He isn&rsquo;t AD, his standing reach is a full 12in longer than AD and his wingspan is 4in longer. That&rsquo;s massive.</p>

I don&rsquo;t remember where, but I saw a stats that said he blocked almost 50% of the shots he actually contested at the rim, which weren&rsquo;t many, cause they didn&rsquo;t try him that much.</p>

<p>Also, he&rsquo;s gonna get better. All the players he faced for the first time, as time goes on he&rsquo;ll know more. </p>

<p>And, finally, how many attempt will we see from players just trying to score on him cause they want a highlight ? We&rsquo;ve already seen it. I don&rsquo;t remember which Toronto player got blocked, tried again, got blocked again, really seemed like he had tunnel vision and just wanted to get Wemby&hellip;</p>

      <label for="liqpfzk" class="commentText"><p>Typically the top defenders arrive in the league as a 1st or 2nd year player (whenever they start getting a ton of minutes) and get tons of blocks.</p>

<p>Then as they age and players wise up to their range/length the blocks go down a bit, but the overall defensive impact increases a ton.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious about Wemby just because he&rsquo;s sooo long and teams aren&rsquo;t going to stop what they&rsquo;re doing on offense specifically for him&hellip; yet.</p>

Players have talked about how they&rsquo;ll put up a short range shot, and Wemby will come out of nowhere and stuff it.  If you can watch the vid of all his blocks.  Trae Young probably has PTSD from all the floaters he had swatted.</p>

<p>Most importantly, just the fact that he&rsquo;s on the floor affects the game, because players have to be cognizant of where he is anytime they get close to the paint.</p>

      <label for="liqpkbc" class="commentText"><p>He’s actually one of the only few examples of an elite rim protector who doesn’t get many blocks. Almost all other great rim protectors get a ton of blocks (although not the other way around). Bam is super unique in that regard because players like Wemby, Gobert, JJJ, Lopez, AD, etc. rack up a ton of blocks. </p>

<p>Honestly, I can’t think of another great rim protector on the level of Bam who had fewer blocks in NBA history. I’ll have to look it up but off the top of my head he’s probably one of the most unique rim protectors ever. </p>

Wemby&rsquo;s rim deterrence is otherworldly, and he arguably had the greatest shot blocking season of all-time when you factor in his all-time block:foul ratio.</p>

<p>Bam on the other hand is the pinnacle of modern versatility blending absurdly good switching with the strength to still hang in the post or at the rim, even if he&rsquo;s not actually blocking the shot</p>

That means Bam is out on the perimeter a lot. The year Marcus Smart won dpoy&hellip;Bam actually guarded something like 30% more switches while holding opponents to a lower fg% than smart.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize Bam’s shot blocking numbers were so low. It doesn’t make me think less of him as a defender, just interesting.</p>

<p>For comparison, Derrick White and Bam came into the league in the same year and it’s fairly close for them. 366 for White and 436 for Bam.</p>
