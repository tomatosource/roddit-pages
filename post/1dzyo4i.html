<p>I think the bigger issue is that being a floor general is very exhausting, there is a reason most floor generals don&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;elite motor&rdquo; that can run around off-ball like steph all day.</p>

We completely sold out to Embiid in the midrange and left the paint open for him. I remember on a handful of occasions he just passed up an open layup.</p>

<p>It was no secret that Harden&rsquo;s finishing in the paint was on the decline, but Joe&rsquo;s strategy really messed them up</p>

      <label for="lciy828" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s not telling the whole story at all though? You guys were playing double bigs to stop Harden&rsquo;s ability to finish at the rim. It wasn&rsquo;t just that you were &ldquo;letting him have an open lane,&rdquo; you still had a big roaming in the paint as well as one on Embiid. Your entire lineups changed to account for Harden&rsquo;s driving and creation out of drives, and nothing else the 76ers did could punish it.</p>

<p>Harden was more doubled than Embiid was that series.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Harden and his work at the rim. How much does The Beard have left in his tank, and can he dominate offensively when Embiid is off the floor? He took 67 shots for 69 points in the opening round against Brooklyn and after a 7-for-13 night from deep in Game 1, Harden shot 7-for-20 over the final three games. But his 4-for-17 at the rim in the series was the real reveal. He went from 6.2 trips to the foul line during the season to 2.8. That’s not the secondary scorer the Sixers sought or need.</p>

      <label for="lciznch" class="commentText"><p>Why are you comparing bigs to guards? 57% TS is absolutely insane for the playoffs. Embiid gets killed because his eFG% is way lower than other MVPs, he relies on getting to the line a ton and you don&rsquo;t get there in game 6s and 7s.</p>

      <label for="lcj0kv2" class="commentText"><p>Embiid has maintained or exceeded his free throw rate every year in the playoffs. eFG% is not a good way to measure efficiency.</p>

<p>Bigs also can be compared to guards, lol. It’s the inherent advantage of being taller and getting easier shots. Is Lebron more efficient than Jokic because he’s smaller? Unless it’s somebody like Gobert who doesn’t even handle the ball, TS% is the only way.</p>

<p>FT counts always go down in games 6 and 7s when physicality goes up (Embiid&rsquo;s efficiency also goes down in these games as a result).</p>

<p>I mean why is this surprising?  he was their 3rd scoring option all year. by the end of the series, they had taken an almost identical amount of shots. Harden came in at .496 eFG% and Embiid at .439 eFG%</p>

<p>Also, Harden was the 2nd scoring option. He lead Maxey in usage and averaged more points.</p>

<p>Harden does provide playmaking, but Embiid is miles more useful on the other side of the ball. 50% of the game. Thats why they were a top 10 defense that year with a Maxey-Harden backcourt.</p>

<p>an individual players defense does not impact the game anywhere nearly as much as you&rsquo;re leading on. we won the games we won because of offense.</p>

<p>For bballref, it&rsquo;s turnovers, field goals, and free throws (FGA and FTA)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the calculation you linked before when looking it up myself, but every practical use of it is the one without assists.</p>
