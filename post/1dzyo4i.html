<p>I think the bigger issue is that being a floor general is very exhausting, there is a reason most floor generals don&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;elite motor&rdquo; that can run around off-ball like steph all day.</p>

We completely sold out to Embiid in the midrange and left the paint open for him. I remember on a handful of occasions he just passed up an open layup.</p>

<p>It was no secret that Harden&rsquo;s finishing in the paint was on the decline, but Joe&rsquo;s strategy really messed them up</p>

      <label for="lciy828" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s not telling the whole story at all though? You guys were playing double bigs to stop Harden&rsquo;s ability to finish at the rim. It wasn&rsquo;t just that you were &ldquo;letting him have an open lane,&rdquo; you still had a big roaming in the paint as well as one on Embiid. Your entire lineups changed to account for Harden&rsquo;s driving and creation out of drives, and nothing else the 76ers did could punish it.</p>

<p>Harden was more doubled than Embiid was that series.</p>

      <label for="lcixo21" class="commentText"><p>It was the stunt and putting Rob as a roamer on PJ that threw their entire scheme off. Harden had no legs left from carrying early on and looked pretty dead by that point.</p>

<p>Embiid still got to the line a ton but Al shut him down in the post.</p>

      <label for="lcixlmp" class="commentText"><p>You can see this mentioned if you read a preview of the series. Embiid spraining his knee just made it worse</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Harden and his work at the rim. How much does The Beard have left in his tank, and can he dominate offensively when Embiid is off the floor? He took 67 shots for 69 points in the opening round against Brooklyn and after a 7-for-13 night from deep in Game 1, Harden shot 7-for-20 over the final three games. But his 4-for-17 at the rim in the series was the real reveal. He went from 6.2 trips to the foul line during the season to 2.8. That’s not the secondary scorer the Sixers sought or need.</p>

<p>Bigs also can be compared to guards, lol. It’s the inherent advantage of being taller and getting easier shots. Is Lebron more efficient than Jokic because he’s smaller? Unless it’s somebody like Gobert who doesn’t even handle the ball, TS% is the only way.</p>

      <label for="lcjfkge" class="commentText"><p>you were trying to make a point about efficiency.</p>

<p>in game 7 vs Atlanta Embiid shot 52% from the field, 40% of the three, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> from the FT line, a 61% TS mark.</p>

<p>His scoring was still plenty efficient in that game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FT counts always go down in games 6 and 7s when physicality goes up (Embiid&rsquo;s efficiency also goes down in these games as a result).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In game 4 his shot was way off, his single-playoff-game worst .361 TS%.  Just one game later he almost doubled it, up to .719 TS%.</p>

<p>When you look at his 10 worst playoff games by TS%:</p>

<ul>
<li>Game 1= 1x</li>
<li>Game 2 = 2x</li>
<li>Game 3 = 2x</li>
<li>Game 4 = 1x</li>
<li>Game 5 = 1x</li>
<li>Game 6 = 2x</li>
<li>Game 7 = 1x</li>

      <label for="lciywms" class="commentText"><p>Usage accounts for assists. Maxey took more shots than Harden both in this series and all season long.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting you&rsquo;re bringing up some blocks but not the 8 assists per game Harden generated, or how Embiid had 20 turnovers to 12 assists</p>

      <label for="lcj07vn" class="commentText"><p>If anybody was describing that team they’d say Harden was the 2nd option in all facets. He wants to be paid like one, and he was signed to do that. Maxey is still developing even now.</p>

<p>Harden does provide playmaking, but Embiid is miles more useful on the other side of the ball. 50% of the game. Thats why they were a top 10 defense that year with a Maxey-Harden backcourt.</p>

      <label for="lcj5f62" class="commentText"><p>i mean harden went into negotiations with the clippers saying he&rsquo;d start at 30m a year. that&rsquo;s not second option money lol. he was willing to give morey a deal too but the dude just started ghosting him after 10+ years of constant communication.</p>

<p>an individual players defense does not impact the game anywhere nearly as much as you&rsquo;re leading on. we won the games we won because of offense.</p>

<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Usage rate accounts for how many possessions a player finished while they were on the floor.</p>

<p>For bballref, it&rsquo;s turnovers, field goals, and free throws (FGA and FTA)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the calculation you linked before when looking it up myself, but every practical use of it is the one without assists.</p>

      <label for="lcjbwev" class="commentText"><p>Embiid was hurt in game 1, and rushed back in game 2 - not playing the full game (a decision which Doc never got enough flak for).</p>

<p>Then he put up</p>

<ul>
<li>30/13/3/1/4 in game 3,</li>
<li>34/13/4/1/0 in game 4,</li>
<li>33/7/3/0/4 in game 5, and</li>
<li>26/10/1/1/3 in game 6.<br>


<ul>
<li>And that is without touching the ball once in the final four minutes, despite being shown constantly waving his arms calling for the ball.  All while Harden walked down the court and dribbled out the clock, and with seconds left ran into a crowded paint for a bad layup attempt.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>He had a single bad game in that series (game 7).</p>

<p>Harden shot 25% in five of seven games, including going 0/6 for 0 points in the 4th quarters of games 5-7 -  statistically worse than what Ben Simmons gave them (0/0, 5 points).  His .538 TS% in the 2023 playoffs was the second worst mark of his playoff career.</p>
