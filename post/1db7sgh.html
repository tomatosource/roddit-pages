<p>Nash may not be remembered as such, but he had some monster playoff performances and just had some terrible luck on top of his teams matching up poorly against the dynastic Spurs.</p>

      <label for="l7pi1dl" class="commentText"><p>That is the nuance to these conversations isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>It is a team sport tying someones greatness to a title isn&rsquo;t especially logical even in a game like basketball where one guy can have so much impact. But I feel like the great players without titles really at least had games of note where they went out on their shield and just lost to better teams.</p>

<p>Harden has so many pivotal games that you can look at and really pin the loss on him.</p>

      <label for="l7pu9ei" class="commentText"><p>One of the Rockets biggest playoff wins during his time there was game 6 of the 2015 WCSF against the Clippers where the Rockets came back from down 20 in the 2nd half facing elimination. The comeback was led by Josh Smith and Corey Brewer of all people with Harden shooting 5-20 and riding the bench during most of the comeback. That game along with other of his elimination game performances aren’t going to have him remembered as a winner unless he really flips it his last few years like Dirk did in 2011.</p>

Stockton 16/4/14, Malone 28/12/2, Jazz win.  Stockton 18/5/12, Malone 32/13/3, Jazz lose.  after a decade of that people just took them for granted.  his argument that KJ was better than Stockton because he was never scared of Stockton is just the absolute dumbest take ever</p>

Both were repeatedly stopped by the dynasties of their time, both were elite offensive engines for revolutionary D’Antoni offenses. Both ringless but had great individual and team regular season success. Harden will hold up better because both his counting stats and the dynasty that stopped him were much better</p>

      <label for="l7paw4q" class="commentText"><p>He got everything he wanted in Houston. He got D&rsquo;Antoni, Howard, then CP3, and even Russ. Got it, and it didn&rsquo;t work, and he forced his way out saying he didn&rsquo;t want to play for them.</p>

<p>Brooklyn I give him some leeway for sure. Kyrie was a fucking disaster and his off court bullshit impacted the team. And Harden was a bit banged up. But he forced his way there, made the Nets give up a lot of assets for him, and him/Kyrie/KD got the coach and guys they wanted, and Harden gave them &hellip;. &amp;lt;100 games before bailing? Forced his way out when he saw greener pastures.</p>

<p>Philly is the one I defend Harden the most on, because Morey really did screw him. But Harden again refused to adjust his playstyle, and immediately hated playing for Doc, and shit the bed when it mattered in the playoffs. And again, forced his way out when he saw greener pastures.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see what happens with the Clippers. He seems like a decent fit. But yet again, disappeared in the playoffs and the team is struggling with injuries as usual with Kawhi. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Harden asks out again after next season.</p>

<p>The guy is a quitter. Has no accountability and quits on his teams over and over. Generational talent. But about the worst teammate you could ask for, especially as a leader of the team.</p>

      <label for="l7pedbf" class="commentText"><p>Houston did cater to everything he wanted but by the time he wanted out it was clear Houston was going in a different direction as evidenced by firing morey and subsequently trading russ for broken down wall. I can’t fault him too much for not wanting to spend the end of his prime next to washed wall and Christian Wood</p>

<p>Brooklyn I can go either way on since he was barely there but retrospectively seems like a shit show admittedly largely of the big 3s making</p>

<p>His reason for leaving Philly I think most people agree is just. He was developing a nice two man game with embiid and adjusting to being more of a primary facilitator by the end of it. His start in Philly was also only a few months removed from the hammy injury that ended his prime so I think early on he was adjusting to a new team as well as newly diminished capabilities</p>

<p>Clippers he’ll probably jump ship when the kawhi/pg thing ends to try to ring chase</p>

<p>I thought my fellow rockets fans would finally recognize Harden for his playoff failures but there’s too much delusion</p>

<p>And his last season he purposely got fat af and was checked out in games to force a trade. I remember it was Wall’s first year with us and he was beyond frustrated with James</p>

<p>It’s a long list ya’know. But in Harden’s defense, I’d argue he’s the best regular season player ever. Do you need someone to drop 50+ against Minnesota on a Tuesday in February? James is your guy!!!</p>

<p>Yes he lead us to the best record in Rockets history. A 1 seed in the Wild West. He got us to the finish line. But he was too shook to cross it, for whatever reason. That’s why the CP3 team was amazing bc CP3 could be that guy to get us a smart bucket and kept everyone on their toes, James included.</p>

Had a better record and more efficient scoring season on similar volume but lost because we arbitrarily value hitting double digits in categories.</p>

<p>I get why he won it because kd just left okc and people were rooting for russ and were also swept up in the hype and history and magic of the season, especially the last game where he had like a 50 point triple double and hit the game winner, but I think we can retrospectively see harden had a better season</p>

<p>Harden&rsquo;s team wasn&rsquo;t whole. He had to play insane minutes and an insane amount of games to keep them afloat, and he did a really damn good job of it given the circumstances. To only win 7 less games with CP3 only playing like 55 games, and Capela and Gordon only playing like 65 is unreal.</p>

<p>Remember that Harden, CP3, and Capela had a like 93% winrate when they played together in 2018, but CP3 and Capela just weren&rsquo;t healthy enough in 2019. That&rsquo;s not Harden&rsquo;s fault.</p>

      <label for="l7pb97b" class="commentText"><p>There are many other parts of the game other than just PPG.</p>

<p>Harden had an incredible season that year, no doubt. But he played no defense and won 7 games fewer than Giannis who plays dominantly both ways and led his team to a 60 win season and 1st seed.</p>

<p>Winning matters.</p>

      <label for="l7pc104" class="commentText"><p>Why do you think winning 7 less games when his next 3 best players were missing almost 20 games each while Harden played 78 out of 82 should be used against Harden?</p>

<p>For comparison, Giannis&rsquo;s 3 best teammates played 77, 81, and 78 games.</p>

<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s not like Harden only provided his own scoring. He was absolutely a &ldquo;system&rdquo; and the pressure he saw from opposing defenses was like nothing we&rsquo;d seen. <a href="https://x.com/arxanii/status/1270952153037897729?s=21" target="_blank">Look at this shit lmao</a></p>

<p>No it freaking was not lmfao. They finished with the 6th seed and got bounced in the first round. There are way, way more individual seasons that were better than Russ&rsquo; MVP.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s arguably the worst MVP handed out in the last 30 years.</p>

<p>I think the exact opposite. Harden would have taken that Thunder team to a 4 seed. The Russ Rockets would have been worse.</p>

<p>And they would&rsquo;ve been last in the West without Westbrook. Also, nothing that happens in the playoffs matters. MVP is a regular season award. You know this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are way, way more individual seasons that were better than Russ&rsquo; MVP.</p>

<p>I never said it was the greatest individual season. I said it&rsquo;s one of the greatest regular season carry jobs ever. Top 10. You couldn&rsquo;t name 10 better carry jobs than that. Not great individual statistical seasons. I&rsquo;m talking about one guy carrying an insane load and dragging a shit team to the playoffs. I made that very clear. Stop bastardizing what I said into something you feel you can argue. It&rsquo;s pathetic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wrong. Malone in &lsquo;97 is easily worse. But you wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about that.</p>

<p>I think the exact opposite. Harden would have taken that Thunder team to a 4 seed. The Russ Rockets would have been worse</p>

<p>God damn, dude. Once again, that&rsquo;s not what I said. I said if you replace both guys with league average starters. You basically misunderstood every single thing I said. And I think you did it deliberately. That&rsquo;s what people like you always do. You&rsquo;re not slick.</p>

      <label for="l7p8s5n" class="commentText"><p>Things just never broke his way when he was on teams that had a chance to actually win. You don&rsquo;t get that many cracks at actually winning a chip, and in 2018 and 2021 when he was on teams that could actually do it they got fucked by injuries.</p>

<p>But never missing the playoffs, averaging 28/6/7 on 59% TS as a starter in his prime across like 150 playoff games, averaging 36ppg in a season when the next closest scorer was at 28ppg (compared to now when 5+ guys are breaking 30 every season), giving up money multiple times to try and improve his basketball situation, carrying some bumass rosters way deeper than they should&rsquo;ve gone, and then basically sacrificing his prime playing 3 playoff games on a torn hamstring including all 53 mins of an OT game 7 to try and win in Brooklyn&hellip; dude definitely deserves more praise than he gets.</p>

<p>The series before his hamstring injury, he averaged 28/7/11 on 77% TS in the first round. He was playing the best brand of basketball he ever played that season - that West Coast road trip without KD was fucking awesome to watch.</p>

<p>Since playing on the injury, he&rsquo;s barely been able to average 20ppg.</p>

<p>There are significantly worse playoff performers than him that don&rsquo;t have every single thread made about them spammed with HUR DURR PLAYOFFS, and it&rsquo;s always a huge double standard with him when it comes to &ldquo;big games.&rdquo; A game is only &ldquo;big&rdquo; if he doesn&rsquo;t do well in it it seems, but dude has plenty of big time clutch moments.</p>

<p>Another underrated part about him is how much work he puts in with the young guys on every single team he&rsquo;s been on. People love to talk shit about him as a teammate for some reason, but he&rsquo;s helped so many young players with their development and would always put in extra practice time with them. They all talk about it, but nobody ever recognizes it.</p>

<p>Prior to the post season the team as a whole never lost two games in a row.</p>

<p>Over a 30 game stretch at one point they went 29-1.</p>

That&rsquo;s what great winning players do, put the team on their back. Idk about being remembered as a winner.</p>

      <label for="l7pho4n" class="commentText"><p>most of his &ldquo;chokes&rdquo; were when series weren&rsquo;t winnable anyway. he&rsquo;s generally really great at the games <em>before elimination</em> to avoid being in like 3-0 or 3-1 situations, but once a series is hopeless it would get bad.</p>

<p>the other part of the coin here is that a lot of his elimination game stats come from series where his team was the one eliminating the other team in 4 or 5, and that would often be against teams like the Jazz or TWolves who were obsessed with doubling/tripling him even if it meant them getting blown out.</p>

<p>Like in 2018 against the Timberwolves, Harden had 44 in game 1 in a 104 to 101 win. Then, the TWolves decided to triple team the fuck out of Harden in game 2 and he shot like shit but the TWolves lost by 20. Exact same thing in game 5 - they sold out way too hard to try and stop Harden all the way to a 20 pt loss and series over.</p>

<p>Exact same story vs the Jazz that year. When they tried to play Harden more straight up, Harden scored super efficiently and the games were a bit closer. But when they tried to execute some gimmick defense to stop Harden, Harden shot like shit but they blew them out with neither series being close to going past 5 lol</p>

      <label for="l7psu4l" class="commentText"><p>I mean that 2021 injury ruined his prime. Trying to conflate those seasons with him as a number 1 option isn&rsquo;t right imo.</p>

<p> We aren&rsquo;t using most guys twilight years against them, and even still he managed to carry 2 wins on his own in each of those series. He was the most efficient playoff scorer through the first 4 games in the entire NBA before his legs died.</p>

<p>Also what are we doing blaming him for &ldquo;choking&rdquo; in the Bucks series? He tried to tough out playing on a torn hammy for three games including all 53 mins of an Ot game 7 because KD wanted him out there. You can&rsquo;t blame him for that. </p>

      <label for="l7ptcip" class="commentText"><p>I agree that hamstring injury ruined him he quite frankly hasnt been the same, sure hes had big meltdowns in the playoffs dating back to his finals days in okc but he was genuinely good in the playoffs from 2014-2020 I never got that notion he was bad but ever since 2021 hes just been quite frankly a net negative besides vs the mavs this series despite his usual disappearances in games 2 (fourth quarter), 5, and 6. Hes still a top 30 player ever but the past couple of seasons have really been a downgrade for several players I can mention harden being at the top of that list.</p>

      <label for="l7ptmx2" class="commentText"><p>You do realize I blamed him for games 5, 6, and not showing up in the fourth vs the mavs in that game 2. In fact I can distinctly remember him being one of the reasons they lost that lower scoring game in the first place. He was the clippers best or 2nd most impactful player with zubac but thats not a high pole at all to reach considering how much of a negative PG was, kawhi was, russ was, norm fell of as well.</p>

I don’t think he’ll go down as a winner similar to how we don’t think of Barkley as one. The years will be kind of him as context fades and stats remain. His step back three highlights will be really impressive. No one will watch him on defense ever again after he retires and no one will endure one of his rockets games in totality (that was not entertaining basketball). He may be one where some kids look at his stats and are confused why he wasn’t a “goat.” I think Westbrook will go down much the same.</p>

<p>I think I have more of a solid idea now. Not taking away from Harden when saying that, but just saying how he&rsquo;s taken that blueprint and ran with it. And it does pay hall-of-fame worthy dividends.</p>
