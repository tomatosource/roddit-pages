<p>It is a team sport tying someones greatness to a title isn&rsquo;t especially logical even in a game like basketball where one guy can have so much impact. But I feel like the great players without titles really at least had games of note where they went out on their shield and just lost to better teams.</p>

<p>Harden has so many pivotal games that you can look at and really pin the loss on him.</p>

      <label for="l7pu9ei" class="commentText"><p>One of the Rockets biggest playoff wins during his time there was game 6 of the 2015 WCSF against the Clippers where the Rockets came back from down 20 in the 2nd half facing elimination. The comeback was led by Josh Smith and Corey Brewer of all people with Harden shooting 5-20 and riding the bench during most of the comeback. That game along with other of his elimination game performances aren’t going to have him remembered as a winner unless he really flips it his last few years like Dirk did in 2011.</p>

<p>Bill Simmons said one of the reasons he wrote his book was so that people didn’t retroactively rank Karl Malone higher and he wanted to make sure the context was there for how good he actually was relative to his gaudy stats. Maybe he’ll do an updated version for Harden lol</p>

      <label for="l7pngub" class="commentText"><p>the thing I dislike about his Malone takes is him acting as if he was crunching tape on the Jazz in the late 80s.  they were never on TV and they didn&rsquo;t even really get on SportsCenter that often because they did not have an exciting style of play. Stockton 16/4/14, Malone 28/12/2, Jazz win.  Stockton 18/5/12, Malone 32/13/3, Jazz lose.  after a decade of that people just took them for granted.  his argument that KJ was better than Stockton because he was never scared of Stockton is just the absolute dumbest take ever</p>

<p>t1: 14 Karl Malone and Lebron</p>

<p>t3: 13 Kareem and Kobe</p>

<p>Most top 5 PPG finishes</p>

<p>t1: 13 Karl Malone and Lebron</p>

<p>3: 12 Kobe</p>

<p>Most top 3 PPG finishes:</p>

<p>1: 11 MJ</p>

<p>2: 10 Lebron</p>

<p>t3: 8 Karl Malone, Shaq, AI, Kobe and Kareem</p>

<p>And this is PPG not total points were he really shines. Malone was also efficient, a great rebounder and a strong defender.</p>

<p>89 vs 51 win Jazz lost to 43 win warriors</p>

<p>90 vs 55 win Jazz lost to 54 win suns</p>

<p>95 vs 60 win Jazz lost to 47 win rockets who added Drexler midseason and won the chip</p>

<p>99 vs 37 win Jazz lost to 35 win Portland</p>

<p>Malone still has a higher playoff PPG than players like Shaq, Bird and Kareem and has the 10th highest ppg among players with 100 playoff games (would be 6th without the Laker year).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know where to rank Malone myself, but I think his career could be one of the biggest whatifs in NBA history which is wild because of how durable both he and Stockton were. Without MJ Karl Malone would 3peat as MVP and have 5 scoring titles including 4 in a row. He would also probably have 2 titles and be a clear top 5 player ever.</p>

      <label for="l7pbgyc" class="commentText"><p>I think he’ll have a better version of Nash’s legacy. Both were repeatedly stopped by the dynasties of their time, both were elite offensive engines for revolutionary D’Antoni offenses. Both ringless but had great individual and team regular season success. Harden will hold up better because both his counting stats and the dynasty that stopped him were much better</p>

Had a better record and more efficient scoring season on similar volume but lost because we arbitrarily value hitting double digits in categories.</p>

<p>I get why he won it because kd just left okc and people were rooting for russ and were also swept up in the hype and history and magic of the season, especially the last game where he had like a 50 point triple double and hit the game winner, but I think we can retrospectively see harden had a better season</p>

<p>Harden&rsquo;s team wasn&rsquo;t whole. He had to play insane minutes and an insane amount of games to keep them afloat, and he did a really damn good job of it given the circumstances. To only win 7 less games with CP3 only playing like 55 games, and Capela and Gordon only playing like 65 is unreal.</p>

<p>Remember that Harden, CP3, and Capela had a like 93% winrate when they played together in 2018, but CP3 and Capela just weren&rsquo;t healthy enough in 2019. That&rsquo;s not Harden&rsquo;s fault.</p>

      <label for="l7q01ow" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t hold lack of playoff success against Harden tbh. He had some very successful years, multiple CF runs, a Finals run (albeit a key bench player) &hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more his volatility, huge ups and huge downs.</p>

<p>But yeah, man they were so unlucky to with CP3 injury in 2018. Would have been an all time upset.</p>

      <label for="l7p8s5n" class="commentText"><p>Things just never broke his way when he was on teams that had a chance to actually win. You don&rsquo;t get that many cracks at actually winning a chip, and in 2018 and 2021 when he was on teams that could actually do it they got fucked by injuries.</p>

<p>But never missing the playoffs, averaging 28/6/7 on 59% TS as a starter in his prime across like 150 playoff games, averaging 36ppg in a season when the next closest scorer was at 28ppg (compared to now when 5+ guys are breaking 30 every season), giving up money multiple times to try and improve his basketball situation, carrying some bumass rosters way deeper than they should&rsquo;ve gone, and then basically sacrificing his prime playing 3 playoff games on a torn hamstring including all 53 mins of an OT game 7 to try and win in Brooklyn&hellip; dude definitely deserves more praise than he gets.</p>

<p>The series before his hamstring injury, he averaged 28/7/11 on 77% TS in the first round. He was playing the best brand of basketball he ever played that season - that West Coast road trip without KD was fucking awesome to watch.</p>

<p>Since playing on the injury, he&rsquo;s barely been able to average 20ppg.</p>

<p>There are significantly worse playoff performers than him that don&rsquo;t have every single thread made about them spammed with HUR DURR PLAYOFFS, and it&rsquo;s always a huge double standard with him when it comes to &ldquo;big games.&rdquo; A game is only &ldquo;big&rdquo; if he doesn&rsquo;t do well in it it seems, but dude has plenty of big time clutch moments.</p>

<p>Another underrated part about him is how much work he puts in with the young guys on every single team he&rsquo;s been on. People love to talk shit about him as a teammate for some reason, but he&rsquo;s helped so many young players with their development and would always put in extra practice time with them. They all talk about it, but nobody ever recognizes it.</p>

<p>Prior to the post season the team as a whole never lost two games in a row.</p>

<p>Over a 30 game stretch at one point they went 29-1.</p>

<p>Health kept the regular season team to a 70+ win record and obviously from beating the Warriors.</p>

      <label for="l7qfnf4" class="commentText"><p>It isn’t a side effect. It’s because the playoffs are just significantly harder because teams prep specifically to stop you instead of hopping on a plane immediately after their previous night’s game and flying over to your city and then doing it all over again 82 times in the regular season. Harden’s legacy will always be marked by what happened to him in the playoffs, just like Demar DeRozan’s.</p>

<p>He was an elite player but he was stopped consistently in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l7pho4n" class="commentText"><p>most of his &ldquo;chokes&rdquo; were when series weren&rsquo;t winnable anyway. he&rsquo;s generally really great at the games <em>before elimination</em> to avoid being in like 3-0 or 3-1 situations, but once a series is hopeless it would get bad.</p>

<p>the other part of the coin here is that a lot of his elimination game stats come from series where his team was the one eliminating the other team in 4 or 5, and that would often be against teams like the Jazz or TWolves who were obsessed with doubling/tripling him even if it meant them getting blown out.</p>

<p>Like in 2018 against the Timberwolves, Harden had 44 in game 1 in a 104 to 101 win. Then, the TWolves decided to triple team the fuck out of Harden in game 2 and he shot like shit but the TWolves lost by 20. Exact same thing in game 5 - they sold out way too hard to try and stop Harden all the way to a 20 pt loss and series over.</p>

<p>Exact same story vs the Jazz that year. When they tried to play Harden more straight up, Harden scored super efficiently and the games were a bit closer. But when they tried to execute some gimmick defense to stop Harden, Harden shot like shit but they blew them out with neither series being close to going past 5 lol</p>

      <label for="l7p9jf0" class="commentText"><p>I think he’ll get that Barkley albatross but it may help him that he’s probably going to the Hall with a fellow albatross wearer in Westbrook (they just seem like they’ll retire around the same time). I don’t think he’ll go down as a winner similar to how we don’t think of Barkley as one. The years will be kind of him as context fades and stats remain. His step back three highlights will be really impressive. No one will watch him on defense ever again after he retires and no one will endure one of his rockets games in totality (that was not entertaining basketball). He may be one where some kids look at his stats and are confused why he wasn’t a “goat.” I think Westbrook will go down much the same.</p>

<p>I think I have more of a solid idea now. Not taking away from Harden when saying that, but just saying how he&rsquo;s taken that blueprint and ran with it. And it does pay hall-of-fame worthy dividends.</p>

<p>One of the greatest scores of our time. If he plays a couple more years he&rsquo;s ending in the top 10 all time scorers and close to top 10 in assists.</p>

      <label for="l7r5i1p" class="commentText"><p>Thing is that history will forget about him under the better players of his time and the new guys.</p>

<p>Right now he&rsquo;s relevant but in 10 years he&rsquo;ll be overlooked for Kawhi, Steph, Bron, Dirk, KD, Giannis, Jokic, Luka/Brown/Tatum (whoever wins this year and maybe they win more) and you are already seeing the new guys, whoever wins of Ant, SGA, Brunson, Hali will be remembered above him if they keep their trajectory.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll fall in that 3rd tier of player below the all time greats and the winners of history and stay as an extremely good player that never won, along with Malone, Stockton, Nash, Barkley, AI, PG, Westbrook, Butler and so on, where you put him is ultimately irrelevant, but him not winning knocks him down a bit, history remembers winners and I&rsquo;d take the Manu Ginobili that stayed in SA with a reduced role and won it all 4 times over the Harden that refused the role and a minor pay cut to go lose in HOU, most teams lose, most players lose, most never win, even less as the star of the team, there are two or three players tops every year and he simply didn&rsquo;t cut it (refs might have helped in 17 or 18, you know when).</p>
