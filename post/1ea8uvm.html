      <label for="lejue39" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been following pretty closely what happened so i&rsquo;ll just add a bit of context :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, he was accused of beating his wife, choking her and other stuff like sitting on her and suffocate her, anyways, terrible stuff. He then responded saying she&rsquo;s lying and he&rsquo;s focused on taking care of his current (at the time) girlfriend and his daugher. To which &ldquo;the current&rdquo; girlfriend responded he&rsquo;s not taking care of his daughter at all iirc.</p></li>

<li><p>A while later, the second girlfriend (the one he was &ldquo;focusing on&rdquo;) accused him of domestic violence too. He said she was lying. He then said he beleves in the german legal system, but then proceeded to settle. Once they settled, Zverev said they settled so he&rsquo;s innocent and we can put the matter to rest, the man is a walking contradiction&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p>Also pretty recently, he was seen during a match trying to hurt a tennis umpire with his racket, he even looked at the umpire to see whether he hurt him. (link : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD-FkGeeR-U" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD-FkGeeR-U</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these actions got him suspended by the ATP btw, who continue pushing him marketing wise, he&rsquo;s being made the face of the tour with such allegations &hellip;</p>

<p>Edit : got a 2 month suspension for the umpire attack</p>

<p>Zverev arrived as a top player way back in 2017 and immediately grabbed attention by beating Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in back to back M1000 finals at just 20 years old. In M1000 and other bo3 matches he absolutely gave the big 3 all they could handle, he was just a generational choker in bo5. Meddy and Stef didn&rsquo;t become top players until 2019 and they never quite challenged the big 3 like Zverev did.</p>

      <label for="lek4nfp" class="commentText"><p>He is definitely the best player right now to not have a slam. If he didnt choke so often he&rsquo;d probably have a few. The top players right now that have the biggest chances of winning a given slam (no particular order) are Zverev, Djokovic, Medvedev, Sinner, and Alcaraz. Anyone else winning would be a big surprise. So it makes sense that he is one of the top names.</p>

Yes, tennis has a lot of younger players but that doesn’t mean he is at a disadvantage at 27, he is right now at his peak. Alcaraz and Sinner are the outliers, most of these 20 year olds are dog shit and can’t handle the pressure.</p>

<p>The average age of grand slam winners are like 25.</p>

      <label for="lek4nyf" class="commentText"><p>Yeah with tennis my standard with an up and coming player is always to wait for them to win a slam first before they’re legit. Tennis is an individual sport and there are four slams a year on three different surfaces, there is plenty of opportunity to win one at some point. It’s not like an NBA title where it’s a team sport and only one a year so legends of the game never win one.</p>

<p>I know the gold medal in tennis is sometimes seems as the “fifth slam”, but I still wouldn’t count Zverev as legit for having won that. Some Puerto Rican girl won the ladies singles gold in 2016 and has never even been to a grand slam semi-final. Zverev isn’t on the same level as the other top players.</p>

      <label for="lek94pe" class="commentText"><p>In theory the gold medal should be at the level of a Slam, but for whatever the reason the draw doesn&rsquo;t pan out that way. Zverev beat Novak to get to the Gold match, but the guys who won silver and bronze that year have combined for 0 slam finals. It&rsquo;s a cool accomplishment but it&rsquo;s much more impressive if you have other great achievements like Rafa, Agassi or Murray do.</p>

<p>As for winning slams your right, you really need to win multiple slams (and preferably on multiple surfaces) to start being mentioned as a face of the sport. There are plenty of Changs, Roddicks and del Potros who win 1 Slam and can never capture that run again. The Big 3 have spoiled us but people forget just how difficult it is to win consistently and for a long period of time. Most mens tennis player&rsquo;s skill drops off considerably after their mid-20s. I think Alcaraz can at least past Sampras and reach the 20 Majors mark (which would be ridiculous to say 20 years ago) but he could also flame out and win his last major at 24.</p>

      <label for="lekl5ne" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s mens tennis too (besides the Big 3 obviously). Usually players peak in their early 20s and then fall off after 25. Women players usually last longer because the style of play is less damaging to the body (plus 3 sets vs 5 in the majors)</p>

<p>Andy Murray has a much more typical career for a tennis star: period of flashing potential but coming up short, the years spent at his peak consistently competing for slams (and he&rsquo;d have quiet a few more if not for FND) followed by flashes of former glory but unable to stay healthy to be a consistent contender.</p>

      <label for="lek0v6e" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it was heavily criticized by the public since the ATP basically set a precedent that they prioritize making a little bit more money over protecting their employees. It&rsquo;s not even like Zverev is a GOAT-tier candidate where it would make sense for him to be covered up for. He&rsquo;s just a good tennis player, nowhere near the greats and a huge choke artist.</p>

<p>Can you imagine an NBA star throwing a basketball straight at the head&rsquo;s ref? And even then, it&rsquo;s still not something that can actually be a flat out weapon like a racket</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He then said he beleves in the german legal system, but then proceeded to settle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The German legal system works a lot different than the American one.</p>

<p>Basically Zverev was ordered to pay 450k Euros earlier by a court without a trial. This is more or less standard for German Law and the one who has to pay can contest these fines. Which Zverev did and what led to the trial.<br>
Over the course of the trial the lawyers of his ex-girlfriend proposed to end the trial over a settlement. The payments Zverev has to make are basically there to cover the state costs etc. He does retain retain the presumption of innocence around this and his ex-girlfriend does not see a single cent.<br>
In his book thats a win and almost everyone would take that. He pays less than originally ordered and is assumed innocent by the law. Its not like he had much to gain by dragging the trial out here.</p>

<p>That being said the first allegations are so severe and with so much supported evidence that we can all assume he was DVing his first Girlfriend.<br>
The second case has much less information to support anything and its more of a &ldquo;he certainly did the first, so we wont give him the benefit of the doubt for the second&rdquo;.</p>

It’s pretty clear in that video that’s he’s trying to hit the umpire’s chair, not the umpire himself. Still really bad, intimidating behaviour, but exaggerating like that just makes me question how objective the rest of your post is, as someone who knows nothing about the situation. </p>

<p>Because, while he is obviously our best player, I still thought he’s nothing special in the grand scheme of basketball, but averaging 14.0 over 767 games actually seems really good to me</p>

      <label for="lekg2zj" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a solid journeyman who is notorious for declining a 4 year, 84 million dollar contract from the Lakers after playing really well there for a year. That kinda fucked up and destabilized his career.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not quite someone you want to be a starter but he&rsquo;s an elite player off the bench and almost won 6th man of the year for best player off the bench. He&rsquo;s solid. His main drawbacks, his size and mediocre outside shooting, are much more substantial negatives in the NBA than they are in international play.</p>

<p>But Germany winning the 2023 world cup was still a thing you heard of, and Schröder is the face of that team. If a Basketball player other than Dirk is known in Germany, it&rsquo;s Schröder, while for example Franz Wagner is way less known even if he&rsquo;s better.</p>

      <label for="leknj5q" class="commentText"><p>Former NBA players to be the flag bearer:</p>

<p>2020: Three (Hachimura, Saturansky, Patty Mills)<br>
2016: One (Scola)<br>
2012: Two (Pau Gasol, Yi Jianlian)<br>
2008: Five (Ginobili, Yao Ming, Nowitzki, Jasikevicius, Kirilenko)<br>
2004: Two (Carlos Arroyo, Yao Ming)<br>
2000: One (Andrew Gaze)</p>

<p>Not crazy to have three reps, especially because there are almost double the flag bearers now with one man/one woman. Think LeBron getting the US spot makes it seem bigger though, because the US had never selected a men&rsquo;s basketball player before.</p>

Most people don&rsquo;t really pay attention though, 99% of people on here couldn&rsquo;t name the 2020 male flag bearer (shoutout Eddy Alvarez).</p>

      <label for="lekqtkz" class="commentText"><p>Maybe some. There are some restrictions as well based on when sports compete/where they are, like obviously a surfer can&rsquo;t hold the flag this year because they are in Tahiti. Usually athletics athletes are more abundant than swimming because swimming is the 1st week and the athletes like to rest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also crazy, but the men&rsquo;s selection this year has a lot less great choices than the women. If you want to pick a former gold medalist (they don&rsquo;t always, but it&rsquo;s a good starting point) I think a short list of James, Vincent Hancock (shooting), and Ryan Crouser (shot put) is probably what the vote ended up being.</p>

1 voting was done for the public (were Dennis and many popular friends of him advertised for him) and the other voting was done for all german athletes participating at the Olympics.<br>
In the combined voting Dennis had almost double the points as second place Zverev (103,54 to 57,57).</p>
