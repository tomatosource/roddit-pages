<p>Caboclo flew to Las Vegas, where the Summer League is being held, yesterday and had a private workout with 17 teams.</p>

<p>After performing great at the last World Cup (16 PTS, 9 REB, 1 BLK averages on 57/31/81 shooting splits) with Brazil, Caboclo signed for Italian club Reyer Venezia, for which he didn&rsquo;t play a single game for because his agent and him found a loophole for him to terminate the contract by himself, without the consent of the club, so that he can sign in the Euroleague with Partizan Belgrade. The Italian club took it to the courts to appeal the decision, and won in the Italian courts, but the Euroleague allowed the termination of his contract.</p>

<p>He spent the past season playing for Partizan Belgrade in the Euroleague where he averaged 9 PTS and 4 REB on 60/50/73 shooting splits.</p>

<p>Before the Serbian league finals series Bruno Caboclo flew to Florida, without informing anyone at the club, because of a custody hearing regarding his child. He was punished with five monthly salaries for breaking club protocol in leaving without announcing it during the season.</p>

<p>Caboclo&rsquo;s agent tried to terminate his contract with Partizan as well, but the Serbian club wouldn&rsquo;t allow it and are looking to let Caboclo go with a buyout fee, since he has a year left on his contract.</p>

<p>Caboclo was the main reason Brazil won the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Riga and qualified for the Paris Olympics, averaging 18 PTS, 7 REB and 2 BLK on 67/57/91 shooting splits during the tournament.</p>

<p>He already spent seven seasons in the NBA, playing with the Raptors, the Kings, the Grizzlies and the Rockets.</p>

      <label for="ldfnfn6" class="commentText"><p>He is such a weird player. An amazing 3pt shooting, can play some defense and score after pnr. The problem is that he has no idea how to use his body. After watching him play for Partizan,  he has literally no inside game. Gobert looks like a prime Hakeem compared to him. Most of the time he wasn&rsquo;t able to get into a position to receive an outside pass, and even when would manage to get it, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to post up even the smallest guards.
What works for him in Brazil is that he plays with solid point guards so they can spam the pnr and partizan didn&rsquo;t really play with a traditional pg.
The worst part about him is that he has no passion for the game (except when he plays for NT), he looks uninterested on/off the court. Also, you can never trust him or his agent. They cheated 3 clubs in a year now so I doubt that there are many European teams interested in getting him. His Partizan contract is still valid for a next year and partizan will not let him go without getting the release clause paid.</p>

<p>Is that something he developed overseas? Because he&rsquo;s a career 30.8% 3pt shooter in the NBA</p>

      <label for="ldg6upr" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, he shot 57% on 1.8 attempts per game at the OQT in Riga as well. He&rsquo;s not a sharpshooter, but he can make threes at a good rate when left open, at least from the international three point line.</p>

<p>The best parts of his game are his defense and rebounding. He&rsquo;s a great switch defender for a center and a good rim protector, while being a good rebounder, on offense as well. He plays his best basketball for Brazil, since he plays with a lot of passion for his national team, and you can see a noticeable difference compared to his club play.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t play nearly as hard for us here the past season, just seemed indiffirent and unmotivated, seemed totally lost on the court despite having all the physical gifts necessary to succeed, while for Brazil he hustles a lot and tries his absolute hardest.</p>

<p>Bruno has really developed his game and has legit small ball 5 equity now. He&rsquo;s been really looking to make the NBA move for a while and now it looks like his time may come and I&rsquo;m excited to see him back.</p>

He screwed over three teams in the past year, and while the NBA teams don&rsquo;t care about that, it&rsquo;s a huge red flag for his character off the court.</p>

The next year he fell out of our rotation immediately, got dumped to Houston, and then Houston didn&rsquo;t play him at all and his NBA career was over. I still don&rsquo;t get it, he was a 37% shooter from 3 who had size and played solid D. He had bad instincts but made up for it with length and effort, which should have been plenty for a backup PF.
