    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I haven’t watched any Bulls games since the trade occurred. But for the magic Vucevic was a two time allstar and was described positively by Luke Walton and Lebron.</p>

<p>Since he got traded to the Bulls it seems like he’s faded to obscurity and the only conversations he’s part of is when Bulls fans complain about him and want him traded to a different team.</p>

<p>What happened that the perception of him flipped so negatively? Did he just get exposed or are the Bulls misusing him?</p>

If he shot more reliably from 3 he’d be truly unstoppable but he really is inconsistent. He’s good for a 5 shooting . But not overall . Teams are fine daring him to take those and it’s often a winnin indicator . Except in 2023 where he shot ridiculous outlier %.</p>

<p>But yes his ability to shoot a bit helps cos it can help n let’s them start Gordon who can’t shoot well. I would love if AD got his 3 ball back which was similar to jokic , low 30s n low volume but occasionally causes issues n drags guys out to guard them .</p>

<p>Good thing Jokic is a 5 and we&rsquo;re comparing him in the context to other 5s. No one&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s Steph Curry out there. The same way we don&rsquo;t compare Steph&rsquo;s post-up game to Jokic.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He shot 39% from 3 on 4.4 attempts in his playoff career. That&rsquo;s a good number for any number 1 option, let alone a Center.</p>

<p>For comparison, Lebron shoots 33% on 5 attempts, Embiid shoots 29% on 4 attempts, Tatum 34% on 7 attempts, Luka 35% on 9 attempts, and none of these guys are considered bad shooters you don&rsquo;t need to respect</p>

      <label for="lbvkooa" class="commentText"><p>Yes nobody saying he’s Steph but the guy said he’s always respected and that objectively isn’t correct . Warriors 22, lakers in 24 ( kinda ), minny in 24 left him open to shoot those threes. Even in 2023 it’s the thing he’s most likely to not hurt you in if you left him to shoot .</p>

<p>Before this year his playoff % was like 45%+. It was boosted by a hot patch in 23 and bubble impriving everyone’s shooting a bit by 3% and those were his two deepest runs. In one two round series it dropped .</p>

<p>What do you think is more accurate the huge 34% sample or the small 39% sample ? That’s not even that much variance anymore . There’s also a bias of when he is in a good shooting groove he’s likely to go further in the playoffs . He’s more like a 34-36% shooter at best .</p>

<p>Those guys you listed are all guarded differently. Embid and tstum have some playoff ‘slump ‘ . I think embid from three and long two is respected more. Actually watching yes he is but his raw 3pt indicators aren’t there . Jokic is more about floater range , layups and inside short midrange . Like I said go rewatch the minny series or the warriors series . He was WIDE OPEN all warriors series and he never took those shots . He’s not a 39% shooter if he was he’d be treated differently- you also notice how he takes more threes in the playoffs cos teamd concede those .</p>

<p>Yes jokic shooting from 3 is a useful weapon especially for a big but no he is not always respected . He literally lost vs minny due to this. They were ok with certain coverage cos they’d close out late or not panic about jokic 3 ball. I’m not sure why this is debatable unless you don’t watch games. In fact it’s the one kinda weakness in jokic offensive game . If he had a more consistent three ball he’d be truly impossible to defend . Ofc he’s a good shooter for a 5 and it can win you games , id be ecstatuc if 5s for my team ( AD) shot like this but doesn’t mean they’re tightly defended. I mean myles turner is probably a better 3pt shooter or similar and I see teams let him shoot too .</p>

<p>Your % when wide open also matters and jokic regular % is basically the same as wide open one . It may also be that jokic inside 15ft is GG so teams are going to let him take 3s.</p>

It&rsquo;s not just that he isn&rsquo;t a good rim protector, he literally gives up the rim.</p>

      <label for="lbs7g3j" class="commentText"><p>Context matters. In the regular season Jokic shoots 3x as many 3s as Sabonis does and is more heavily guarded at the 3 point line compared to Sabonis where defenders mostly sag off.</p>

<p>Jokic also shoots 39% from 3 on 4.4 attempts in the playoffs for his career compared to Sabonis who shoots 18% from 3 on less than 1 attempt.</p>

<p>I agree, I wouldn&rsquo;t call Jokic an elite defender but his fast hands and positioning definitely puts him above Sabonis for me.</p>

<p>He slowly improved his shot over years. He went from a non-shooter, to taking 3 a game, then rose to 6 a game hitting them at 40% for a year.</p>

<p>Then the whole first half of the season he got traded, he continued hitting them over 40% at over 6 taken a game.</p>

<p>Then got to Chicago and his shot fell off an absolute cliff, reverting back to what he was hitting when he first started shooting.</p>

His numbers in Chicago have looked like his numbers prior: mostly bad with a patch of acceptable</p>

<p>Growth is not linear in the nba. If a player hasn’t actually proven they’re reliable you shouldn’t expect the outliers to represent who someone is</p>

<p>The reality is that most fans have not given a shit about or followed vuc/orlando/Chicago for his time in the league/there and they most vividly remember that one year because he was really good and was an all star. That colors people’s perception of him in a way that doesn’t represent what his careers been and ultimately who he’s been as a player</p>

For what it’s worth if you do something for an entire season you’ve proven yourself. The regression is what’s bizarre as once players improve they tend to stay that way (look at Lebron’s improved numbers for example or brook Lopez or other guys who have “learned to shoot”)</p>

<p>When in reality he started shooting, and then improved over 4 years, and then continued that efficient shooting over two seasons, and when he showed that he could sustain those levels, he got traded. His best shooting came as he increased his volume as well.</p>

<p>How exactly does a player prove that they are &ldquo;reliable&rdquo;, other than improving and then sustaining that improvement. You act like you could have seen this cliff drop coming, when it makes almost no sense that he is a worse shooter now than he has ever been.</p>

<p>I drank so much Fournier kool-aid that half-season that we took him. It was just 2 second round picks, so 40% of a very pissed off old-ass Jae Crowder, but I&rsquo;m still disappointed at how poorly he played, offensively, for the C&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="lbrsev3" class="commentText"><p>I was looking that up a few days ago. It&rsquo;s an absolutely insane stat. I rechecked to make sure I remembered right. Among all people with C eligibility, he ranks 42nd in FTA per game. That means that there are backups in the league who average more FTs than Vuc. Granted, some guys would have PF/C eligibility who are also counted in this. But if guys like Plumlee/Love/Day&rsquo;Ron Sharpe average more FTs/Game than you, it&rsquo;s a bit of a weakness.</p>

<p>But wait. Now the real reason I was looking up this stat.</p>

<p>On the same list, Dominayton ranks 52nd, behind stalwarts such as Dario Saric and Deandre Jordan.</p>

No one treats him as a shooting threat. He took 313 3s last season. 275 of them were wide open, according to <a href="https://NBA.com" target="_blank">NBA.com</a>. He shot 30.5% on those shots, lower than anyone else in the league who took 200 open 3s.</p>

They’ll have to hit the cap floor when Lavine is gone and vuc will help them do that. Then they can feature Vuc like Orlando did and hopefully Vuc can get them a first. 20 mil isn’t a lot for a player tho Vuc hasn’t shown to be worth that.</p>

<p>The biggest issue with Vuc isn’t that he’s making 20 mill, it’s that he’s making 20 mill next year and the year after that</p>

<p>And he’s like 34 years old, he’s only regressing, so you have to eat his salary this summer and the next, it’s really crippling to have a regressing center on a 20+ mill contract year after year who doesn’t contribute anything you’d want a center to contribute on a bad team</p>

      <label for="lbqptib" class="commentText"><p>His big thing was being a center that could space the floor. That was really the one skill that gave him very real utility in the modern NBA. Even with all his other deficiencies, being a legit spacing 5 means you can take advantage of an undervalued (in that situation) non-shooting creator or defensive ace (or run 5-out if you&rsquo;ve got it all). That can be huge. Two out of three years it looked pretty solid, especially that 40% mark the year he was traded/last time he was an all star.</p>

<p>Since then he hasn&rsquo;t been league average in any one season, and last season he shot 29%. Three solid years of bad shooting. 32% overall over that stretch. At this point - he can&rsquo;t do the one thing that makes him worth playing.</p>

      <label for="lbql8mk" class="commentText"><p>He rebounds well overall and can be a good post scorer. Purely off of counting stats he&rsquo;s really consistent as a <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> type.</p>

<p>Defensively he&rsquo;s average down low at best with no switchability.</p>

<p>His 3 point shot also fell off a cliff last season. If maintained around 35% he&rsquo;d still have some trade value, but below 30% doesn&rsquo;t cut it in the modern NBA.</p>

<p>Additionally he&rsquo;s a clunky fit as most bigmen for contending teams are defensively impactful and athletic. At 20 million per year he&rsquo;s a bad fit for any team that doesn&rsquo;t want to tread water.</p>

      <label for="lbqscwg" class="commentText"><p>In hindsight it didn&rsquo;t work out, but at the time it was a fine trade.</p>

<p>A two-time all star center to pair with your rising all-star in Zach who was one of the best SGs in the league and threatening to leave. Getting Vuc helped attract Lonzo/DeMar and get us out of the mid zone.</p>

<p>WCJ was pretty replaceable if you watched him. The first 1st was shaping up to be in the 15-20 range until COVID demolished us, and the Magic got lucky with Franz. The 2nd pick would have been in the 20s if the team could stay healthy, as well. But then Lonzo happened, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, in a world where Bridges gets five 1sts, two mid-late 1sts for an AS center is not a bad trade.</p>

Trading away a lottery pick for a 30 year old center when you’re not competitive for a top 6 seed, doesn’t really make sense, and many people said that at the time.</p>

      <label for="lbr1uvd" class="commentText"><p>Lonzo coming was the worst kept secret in the NBA, so Vucevic didn’t affect that. I know Demar had the prior relationship with Vucevic but we gave Demar the most money, so I think that’s really the reason he came.</p>

<p>Adding Vuc also would not have put us solidly in the 15-20 range. We were the 10 seed at the time and realistically only were really going to be a threat for the 7 seed where we likely would have lost in the first round. Even if everything went well, likely range for the pick was more like 10-16. And that’s if everything went well. It just was completely unnecessary to make the Vuc trade at that time. Should have waited until the summer to augment the roster. Still would have gotten Lonzo, Demar and could have made some other trade instead if Vuc had gone somewhere else like Boston at the deadline.</p>

<p>He’s not a good defender or rim protector at all but they figured “Hey we’ve got two of the best perimeter defenders in the league with Lonzo and Caruso so we can work with that as long as he’s stretching the floor to get our offense going”.</p>

<p>So on top of Vucevic being horrible from 3 the very next season, Lonzo is finished and Caruso is injured for half the season and not 100% for the rest of it. So now you’ve got a big man that doesnt provide the spacing you expected to let your scorers work and no perimeter defense to take the defensive responsibilities off of him either, so now he gets exposed as an inefficent scoring big with no defense, therefore no value.</p>

To get Carter and Wagner is lopsided and if Jett Howard is even a top 8 player on the team eventually it just tilts the scales even more.
The Orlando magic have won 3 times as many playoff games since the trade.</p>

      <label for="lbqq76k" class="commentText"><p>I think most people are being too harsh here. I watch a ton of Bulls games and he’s a steady, available, consistent scorer. That’s nothing to scoff at. The defensive issues are real though and part of the issue that everyone sees is there is just a limitation on how far a team can go with him as a centerpiece. Big man defense is just more important than offense, unless you’re incredibly elite at it like Jokic. On offense he doesn’t generate a ton of looks for everyone else. He’s not so amazing he demands doubles like Embiid and can’t pass like Jokic. His shooting is good but he also doesn’t quite pull guys out. They don’t go full Draymond on him but teams are willing to concede the three and so he doesn’t quite have as much gravity as you’d expect just based on the numbers. So you basically just get the scoring.</p>

<p>He actually works well for the Bulls, who don’t really want to push to win and are happy to be middle of the pack. It’s just hard to picture him as being part of a winning team but he’s also maybe too good for a full tank.</p>

      <label for="lbqs7xp" class="commentText"><p>Imo in the current nba you NEED to have a good defensive center, without that it makes shit way too complicated. You need a 4 that can matchup with 5’s and has the speed to stay in front of the wings if your center is bad at defense. This is wayyy too rare to spend on a player like Vucevic, who is not even that good offensively to begin with.</p>

      <label for="lbqwrlc" class="commentText"><p>Because he’s a talented loser and has been his whole career. He’s very good at making the kinds of shots that efficient offenses don’t take and he’s middling-to-bad at most of the stuff every team needs their center to do. It’s just not winning basketball for a big to take 8-9 contested twelve foot jump shots every game and do fuck all to protect the rim or guard the paint</p>

      <label for="lbqxuku" class="commentText"><p>Seems like he just passed his peak. Happens to everyone, but he has to adjust and his team has to adjust expectations.</p>

<p>He has been less efficient and as the league evolves, he’s been exposed more defensively.</p>

<p>In Orlando, he was in a good defensive system under Steve Clifford and actually played well defensively within the system, although he didn’t block shots so most people have a hard time seeing his defensive impact when just looking at numbers.</p>

<p>He also benefitted from a team that needed volume scoring, and he developed a 3 point shot at the perfect time. Him and Fournier had a pretty good two-man game, although it was pretty boring and mostly predictable.</p>

<p>Now, he’s part of a worse defensive team without the chemistry he had in Orlando. On top of that, his efficiency is down and that could be due to the chemistry and/or just that he’s come back down to earth.</p>

<p>He should probably be looked at as more of a backup/veteran center moving forward. He also needs to accept that role, and he could still be an important contributor to a winning team in the future.</p>

      <label for="lbrc526" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s been above avg on the Bulls, like he hasn&rsquo;t been bad, he&rsquo;s been okay to pretty good imo, but on the Bulls, Demar and Zach and Coby have eaten up his usage so he&rsquo;s not been as great as he was on the magic</p>

<p>also his 3 ball went to shit</p>

<p>Also the lack of Lonzo, or any decent PG after his injury except for that short stint where they had Dragic (who was awesome for them) then mysteriously traded Dragic to ruin their season by having absolutely no PG on the roster</p>

<p>That didn&rsquo;t help. Stacy constantly complains often when he&rsquo;s open and they just cannot feed him the ball.</p>

<p>Coby White seems really stoned half the time so I just dunno if it&rsquo;s Vuc or if the person running the Bulls roster was abducted after Lonzo went down and replaced with a chimp, because a big issue with Vuc is the Bulls players just miss the opportunities to give it to him in his spots.</p>

      <label for="lbvj64k" class="commentText"><p>What happened is that the Bulls made an all-in trade and then underperformed, which granted the Magic two lottery picks that should have been in the 20s.</p>

<p>Vooch soaks up minutes at the 5 and gives you average play. He&rsquo;s making 20 million when his value is closer to 15 million. Is that the end of the world? It is if you&rsquo;re an entitled Bulls fan who wants to dominate the Bulls sub-reddit by calling everyone trash.</p>

<p>If you look through this thread, you&rsquo;ll see the haters are mostly Bulls fans. Yes, many of them were the same ones biching about Markennen and White and Carter and how Gar/Pax needed to be strung up and the owners are the worst, etc.</p>

<p>So, typical NBA fanbase.</p>

<p>For the record, I think Vooch is okay, He shows up and he competes until he gets tired, and then he plays matador D. The Bulls have been running in place since Lonzo&rsquo;s injury. They&rsquo;ll hang on to Vooch unless someone throws some picks at them.</p>

<p>He used to hit these crazy long 2 pt fadeaways that made him look like he had a shooting guards skillset.</p>

<p>On top of that he had some crazy rebounding record, I think. It may have been blocks. It&rsquo;s been so long and I&rsquo;ve grown so old.</p>

<p>Anyways, when they traded him Demar DeRozan was the only person on his new team who needed to take long 2s.</p>

<p>If you look at his stats he hasn&rsquo;t really gotten worse by any metric except 3% and a lot of that could be attributed to Chicago&rsquo;s terrible luck considering they were top seed favorites the year they traded for Vuc.</p>

Remember Hinrich, Gordon, Nocioni? Look ,we now have Vooch, Williams ( passed on Halliburton ) , Lavine (ridiculous signing).  He gave away Lauri for nothing now the whole league wants him! Reinsdorf is the worst owner in sports. Hires dumb leaders and holds in to them for decades.</p>

      <label for="lbufwr2" class="commentText"><p>Real Magic fans know, Vuch was never a star. He was never a feature player.  If he starts at your center then other teams attack your drop coverage relentlessly. It’s a layup. He makes you a soft team.</p>

<p>He’s a great guy. And a great role player. The reason why he was a 2x all star is because of Steve Clifford. Much like Al Jefferson and Dwight Howard before him, Vuch shined with Steve Clifford because is an excellent big man coach. His scheme favors the post.</p>

<p>Edit: More Steve Clifford post man coach praise: If he had been there 2-3 more years Mark Williams is a better version of Capela and gets paid big.</p>

<li><p>If you are bothered by me asking this question, you have the option to just skip past it</p></li>

      <label for="lbrq8jr" class="commentText"><p>The only relevant thing you said in your diarrhea dialogue was &ldquo;Do the people on YouTube and Google watch different games compared to the people on this forum?&rdquo;. No they clearly don&rsquo;t. This is the main NBA sub to talk basketball and people like you constantly come along and ask dumb questions that a 5 mins Google/YT search would solve. So fix that</p>
