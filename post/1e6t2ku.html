That season was the height of kobe chucking hero ball - <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html" target="_blank">with terrible efficiency, significantly fewer assists, and much worse defense.</a></p>

<p>Kobe actually never even came close to peak Dwade efficiency, defense, or playmaking. Peak Dwade is much better than peak Kobe and its not close, if you have eyes and half a brain. Dwade&rsquo;s big issue obviously was durability because of his arguably botched surgeries.</p>

      <label for="ldvy1xf" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was fantastic that year, wym? You&rsquo;re being too harsh. Defensively he was weak, but that&rsquo;s because he was shouldering a monstrous offensive load with a weak supporting cast (offensively speaking). 34.2 pp75 on 104 TS+ is actually pretty damn good lol. His offensive on/off was +18.9, and while not a perfect stat, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s the best result we have on record!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re doing yourself a disservice by being so dismissive of Kobe. Wade definitely has an argument for better peak, but so does Kobe. I wouldn&rsquo;t personally choose 2006 (01/08/09 all have arguments), but it&rsquo;s really not a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the rest of the NBA, LeBron and Wade predictably were less than the sum of their parts due to their games having too much overlap, so they only managed 2 titles instead of the 7+ they were giddily boasting about.</p>

He had his meniscus removed before ever stepping foot on an nba court which was really controversial. He finally opted for a second surgery right after the 06 chip and it just got worse and worse for him every year.</p>

<p>Like a lot of players we never actually saw his prime. People forget the discussion started to become is Dwyane Wade what we thought LeBron would be? Is HE the best player in the world?</p>

<p>Edit: I remember he said on another podcast he was ready to form the Heatles because he knew it was the only choice he had to prolong his career. He was getting injections in his knee just to play on the road to show appreciation to all the nba fans.</p>

<p>If anything, it’s the stopping that wore him out. Wade had an insane stopping ability which puts a lot of strain on your knees. Just look at his eurosteps and footwork around defenders to change directions.</p>

<p>Hell, I studied Wade growing up and copied his euros. Can confirm my knees are shot now lol</p>

<p>You also want to prove that you&rsquo;re better than all of your peers at some aspects of ball, and that&rsquo;s generally through hardware.</p>

<p>Best scorer, rebounder, most valuable, etc. And MJ has more hardware than lbj even if you exclude rings.</p>

<p>Im no lbj hater either. I do agree with you and lbj uplifting teams. He&rsquo;s soo fucking good at everything that he can plug any weakness his team has. Need rebounding? Got it. More assists? Np. Scoring too.</p>

<p>Imo he&rsquo;s clearly the greatest FLOOR RAISER in nba history.</p>

<p>However, MJ is the greatest ceiling raiser. Give him comparable talent to any team, and he himself will find some fucking way to make sure you never lose.</p>

<p>During his bull years he felt inevitable&ndash; as in everyone just expected, just KNEW he was going to win.</p>

<p>He psychologically owned the league more than anyone other than maybe bill russell.  Teams would fear facing him lol. Players on opposing teams admitted to getting into fights if one of their teammates talked shit to MJ, and made mj mad lol.</p>

<p>It was complete dominance.</p>

The Cavs and Lakers were #1 seed in their respective conference and had like 20 more wins than the Heat. The stats were also close enough that you can&rsquo;t even use that as the basis of your argument.</p>

But the Mavs had zero hope of stopping Wade playing straight up, so he definitely drew a ton of contact that series.  If an athletic guard sees that the refs are calling fouls, he should attack every time.</p>

With around 5 rebounds in an era where stats like that weren&rsquo;t inflated like today. Prime Dwade was giving production similar to Kobe and Lebron. Imo he was on that level. I’d give my left pinky toe to see him have a fully healthy career so we could see him maybe challenge Kobe for the spot behind MJ. Even with the injuries everyone still sees him as 3rd. That alone tells you just how damn good he was. </p>

He could handle the rock, he could pass, he could playmake, he could defend, he could slash, and of course, he could score. He wasn’t goat trajectory, but injuries def did a number on him. Him not really having all that good of a team between his days with Shaq and the Heatles also played a role.</p>

<p>in 09 and 2010, he played 1 playoff series each year, what do you want ppl to do about that? Take a 7 and 5 game sample and throw away thousands of regular season games data?</p>

<p>He was a decent midranger and a great slasher but was never really considered a good shooter and that&rsquo;s ok.</p>

      <label for="ldw1htw" class="commentText"><p>Wade came into the league with lingering knee injuries. Rose was better on offense because of his athleticism but they had similar play styles so who knows how athletic Wade would have been. Rose was also 23 when his injuries took place so allot of his development and peak were stifled. Wade’s defense was second to only Jordan when it comes to shooting guards but yet again, how much better could he have been if he didn’t come into the league with bum knees? Rose was getting better on defense every year but I don’t think he ever would have been up there with Wade and Jordan. Allot of what ifs in this question but I think barring injuries Wade takes it with his defense. The defensive gap between the two I think would be allot bigger than the offensive gap between the two, which is why I’d have to pick Wade. Also as a bonus I’d say without injuries or Lebron joining, both of these guys win at least one more ring at some point as the main guy.</p>

Also having the most success as a robin to LeBron doesn’t help. But Wade was a monster at his best, and hit that level only 2 or 3 seasons into his career. Maybe not the GOAT but if he played at that level for 12 seasons instead of 6ish he coulda been considered top 10.</p>

      <label for="ldvpgut" class="commentText"><p>He didn&rsquo;t really have a chance at GOAT. His shot isn&rsquo;t as good, and his defense is not as good. You could say what if on loads of players with injuries.</p>

<p>That being said even though he got a good whistle in the finals, he never had the whistle that Kobe had. Kobe averaged over 13 FTA twice in his career in the 2000s. That&rsquo;s nuts. Wade only made it over 10 twice and never to 11. There was some clear ass bias for Kobe, who quite honestly is his closest competitor IMO. They have very similar stats in some ways, but Kobe was probably better on D due to those knee issues Wade had.</p>

      <label for="ldw50h9" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was a very good defender, especially when he was younger, but I&rsquo;ll take Wade&rsquo;s defense over Kobe any day.  Prime Wade was an incredible defender.  If all-defense selections weren&rsquo;t just a popularity contest, their numbers would be very close on that front because of how good Wade was even with the shorter career.</p>

<p>i respect ur opinion but i cant see wade as a pippen since he won his first chip as the &ldquo;jordan&rdquo; and even in 2011 he was the best heat player during the finals. he accomplished too much as the guy to be a pippen</p>
