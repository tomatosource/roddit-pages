He had his meniscus removed before ever stepping foot on an nba court which was really controversial. He finally opted for a second surgery right after the 06 chip and it just got worse and worse for him every year.</p>

<p>Like a lot of players we never actually saw his prime. People forget the discussion started to become is Dwyane Wade what we thought LeBron would be? Is HE the best player in the world?</p>

<p>Edit: I remember he said on another podcast he was ready to form the Heatles because he knew it was the only choice he had to prolong his career. He was getting injections in his knee just to play on the road to show appreciation to all the nba fans.</p>

<p>If anything, it’s the stopping that wore him out. Wade had an insane stopping ability which puts a lot of strain on your knees. Just look at his eurosteps and footwork around defenders to change directions.</p>

<p>Hell, I studied Wade growing up and copied his euros. Can confirm my knees are shot now lol</p>

<p>He looked scared and didn&rsquo;t do anything but stand there when Wade was trying his best to carry him to a ring.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, LeBron had also had some masterful playoff performances but when you&rsquo;re talking about GOAT the bar is pretty high.</p>

      <label for="ldvodsv" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a competitive sport. The ultimate goal of competing is to win.</p>

<p>You also want to prove that you&rsquo;re better than all of your peers at some aspects of ball, and that&rsquo;s generally through hardware.</p>

<p>Best scorer, rebounder, most valuable, etc. And MJ has more hardware than lbj even if you exclude rings.</p>

<p>Im no lbj hater either. I do agree with you and lbj uplifting teams. He&rsquo;s soo fucking good at everything that he can plug any weakness his team has. Need rebounding? Got it. More assists? Np. Scoring too.</p>

<p>Imo he&rsquo;s clearly the greatest FLOOR RAISER in nba history.</p>

<p>However, MJ is the greatest ceiling raiser. Give him comparable talent to any team, and he himself will find some fucking way to make sure you never lose.</p>

<p>During his bull years he felt inevitable&ndash; as in everyone just expected, just KNEW he was going to win.</p>

<p>He psychologically owned the league more than anyone other than maybe bill russell.  Teams would fear facing him lol. Players on opposing teams admitted to getting into fights if one of their teammates talked shit to MJ, and made mj mad lol.</p>

<p>It was complete dominance.</p>

<p>Hakeem olajuwon in his autobiography,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Michael Jordan was an animal in the jungle, he would sleep on the biggest rock and nobody would disturb him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dominance.</p>

I’d give my left pinky toe to see him have a fully healthy career so we could see him maybe challenge Kobe for the spot behind MJ. Even with the injuries everyone still sees him as 3rd.

He could handle the rock, he could pass, he could playmake, he could defend, he could slash, and of course, he could score. He wasn’t goat trajectory, but injuries def did a number on him. Him not really having all that good of a team between his days with Shaq and the Heatles also played a role.</p>

<p>That being said even though he got a good whistle in the finals, he never had the whistle that Kobe had. Kobe averaged over 13 FTA twice in his career in the 2000s. That&rsquo;s nuts. Wade only made it over 10 twice and never to 11. There was some clear ass bias for Kobe, who quite honestly is his closest competitor IMO. They have very similar stats in some ways, but Kobe was probably better on D due to those knee issues Wade had.</p>

      <label for="ldvrqke" class="commentText"><p>The &ldquo;running back&rdquo; type scorers never get any credit as being pure scorers because of how ugly it is, but that shit got the job done. Wade, LBJ, Westbrook, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m missing others were feasting on teams because they were simply too big and too fast to stop, even when the game plan was to prevent it.</p>

<p>i respect ur opinion but i cant see wade as a pippen since he won his first chip as the &ldquo;jordan&rdquo; and even in 2011 he was the best heat player during the finals. he accomplished too much as the guy to be a pippen</p>
