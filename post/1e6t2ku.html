<p>The only efficency argument you can make is maybe Kobe. Once again MJ for his career averaged better shooting split the whole time then Wade did in his best season.</p>

<p>Even if you did it with just a simple multiplicative factor, like [Stat 2004]*[League Avg Pace 2024]/[League avg Pace 2004] = [Pace Adjusted Stat], that could tell you a little bit about how it compares.</p>

<p>Between 1991 and 1998, Jordan played 6 complete seasons.  Was champion in all of them, Finals MVP in all of them, scoring champion in all of them, 1st team all-NBA and 1st team all-defence in all of them and was regular season MVP in 4 of them.  And the 2 years he didn’t win MVP he went up against the winner in the finals and beat them.</p>

Miami Lebron&rsquo;s case is because of his efficiency and advanced metrics. It&rsquo;s during his 1st Cavs stint where Lebron was stuffing the stat sheet more, not in Miami.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the rest of the NBA, LeBron and Wade predictably were less than the sum of their parts due to their games having too much overlap, so they only managed 2 titles instead of the 7+ they were giddily boasting about.</p>

He had his meniscus removed before ever stepping foot on an nba court which was really controversial. He finally opted for a second surgery right after the 06 chip and it just got worse and worse for him every year.</p>

<p>Like a lot of players we never actually saw his prime. People forget the discussion started to become is Dwyane Wade what we thought LeBron would be? Is HE the best player in the world?</p>

<p>Edit: I remember he said on another podcast he was ready to form the Heatles because he knew it was the only choice he had to prolong his career. He was getting injections in his knee just to play on the road to show appreciation to all the nba fans.</p>

<p>If anything, it’s the stopping that wore him out. Wade had an insane stopping ability which puts a lot of strain on your knees. Just look at his eurosteps and footwork around defenders to change directions.</p>

<p>Hell, I studied Wade growing up and copied his euros. Can confirm my knees are shot now lol</p>

      <label for="ldwdxqq" class="commentText"><p>It’s similar to Frank Gore. People forget he blew out both of his knees horribly in college and still went on to have one of the longest RB careers ever. In college he was incredibly fast and explosive but changed his game to be more a bruiser after. Without the injuries he probably winds up in top 3-5</p>

Everyone probably remembers 2009 as Kobe or Lebron for best player (I think that was when the puppet commercial was massive), but Wade was arguably better than either that year, and that was already after struggling with his first big injuries the 2 years prior.</p>

Although those 2 were incredible with poor supporting casts, LeBron with a similar situation always found a way to still elevate those Cavs to the top of the East.</p>

Lebron took entire cast of scrubs to the finals multiple times it insane how he elevates his entire team for 20 years straight now, where as Kobe/Dwade/Jordan couldnt go as far without a 2nd star and solid cast. Its what solidifies him as the 🐐</p>

      <label for="ldviomm" class="commentText"><p>Also was a damn good playmaker as well. In his prime he was giving you 7 assists per game. With around 5 rebounds in an era where stats like that weren&rsquo;t inflated like today. Prime Dwade was giving production similar to Kobe and Lebron. Imo he was on that level. I’d give my left pinky toe to see him have a fully healthy career so we could see him maybe challenge Kobe for the spot behind MJ. Even with the injuries everyone still sees him as 3rd. That alone tells you just how damn good he was. </p>

      <label for="ldwsoo0" class="commentText"><p>Some career highs for dunks in a season:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wade - 152</p></li>

<li><p>Lebron-  145</p></li>

<li><p>Vince Carter - 131</p></li>

<li><p>Kobe - 116</p></li>

<li><p>Tracy McGrady - 116</p></li>

<li><p>Jordan (since 96) - 89</p></li>

<li><p>Westbrook - 69</p></li>

<li><p>Rose - 32</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In 2006, Wade had 152 dunks. Only 9 players surpassed his 06 total in 2024, all PFs or Cs. The highest listed guard this year was Scottie Barnes with 73, and then Anthony Edwards with 67.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Wade did this in an era where everyone packed the paint with non-shooting centers and forwards. Watching him navigate the packed paint with no spacing out there and still jam it down was incredible.</p>

<p>The kind of numbers prime Dwyane Wade would have put up today playing 4 and 5 out would have been otherworldly. He certainly would have had more dunks with the pace and spacing players are afforded in the modern NBA.</p>

Also having the most success as a robin to LeBron doesn’t help. But Wade was a monster at his best, and hit that level only 2 or 3 seasons into his career. Maybe not the GOAT but if he played at that level for 12 seasons instead of 6ish he coulda been considered top 10.</p>

      <label for="ldw1htw" class="commentText"><p>Wade came into the league with lingering knee injuries. Rose was better on offense because of his athleticism but they had similar play styles so who knows how athletic Wade would have been. Rose was also 23 when his injuries took place so allot of his development and peak were stifled. Wade’s defense was second to only Jordan when it comes to shooting guards but yet again, how much better could he have been if he didn’t come into the league with bum knees? Rose was getting better on defense every year but I don’t think he ever would have been up there with Wade and Jordan. Allot of what ifs in this question but I think barring injuries Wade takes it with his defense. The defensive gap between the two I think would be allot bigger than the offensive gap between the two, which is why I’d have to pick Wade. Also as a bonus I’d say without injuries or Lebron joining, both of these guys win at least one more ring at some point as the main guy.</p>

<p>That being said even though he got a good whistle in the finals, he never had the whistle that Kobe had. Kobe averaged over 13 FTA twice in his career in the 2000s. That&rsquo;s nuts. Wade only made it over 10 twice and never to 11. There was some clear ass bias for Kobe, who quite honestly is his closest competitor IMO. They have very similar stats in some ways, but Kobe was probably better on D due to those knee issues Wade had.</p>

      <label for="ldwf0pz" class="commentText"><p>offtopic but i think like this about Vince Carter. Could do literally everything, including being a very good shooter from way deep from early on, the most creative and elegant finisher i&rsquo;ve ever seen, a fantastic fade-away, the dunks, the aura&hellip;.not sure what happened there since he had a great career. As for D-wade, man was something else and part of one of the coolest teams in NBA history (including the heat not just with bron but with shaq, and crew of vets like payton , White chocolate, Posey, Alonzo mourning (from the bench), and Mr Shimmy Toine Walker. Not sure about the GOAT stuff since i hate that conversation. One of the best going to the rim bar none.</p>

      <label for="ldwmddn" class="commentText"><p>Someone who can’t shoot/plays like d wade doesn’t have a game that ages well and puts themselves at a FAR higher risk to get hurt. Unfortunately you can’t really have 1 without the other, so it’s not even a point worth making. What made him great was the way he played, and the way he played is why he got hurt. Not a knock at all because he was incredible, but you see a lot of guys who can play like that in their 20s. The guys who are still great in their 30s tend to be a bit more finesse</p>
