<p>Fortunately for the rest of the NBA, LeBron and Wade predictably were less than the sum of their parts due to their games having too much overlap, so they only managed 2 titles instead of the 7+ they were giddily boasting about.</p>

      <label for="ldwds3d" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t remember the publication (might have been Sports Illustrated) but they had Wade at #1 in their list of best NBA players after the 2010 season I think it was? And LeBron joined up with <em>that</em> version of Wade. Imagine Jordan teaming up with Magic in the late 80s instead of sticking with the Bulls? It would have been game over for everybody else.<br>
Some people argue that it was vindicated because the Cavs were supposedly trash but that team was good enough to secure the #1 seed in the entire league in both 2009 and 2010. LeBron just didn&rsquo;t get it done when they needed him most, and that was the two elimination games where a win would have seen both series go to a game seven on the Cavs home court. Literally the best reward possible in those situations. But LeBron went and shot 40% and 38% instead&hellip;.the Orlando game where he had 25pts on 40% shooting (low 50s TS%) was especially bad, not because they are particularly terrible numbers on their own but when you consider he was averaging a crazy 42ppg on over 60% TS in the first five games of that series, then it starts to look a lot worse. He had 17 points less than his average and they lost by 13. It&rsquo;s literally where he got the nickname LeChoke from. You can have the best regular season numbers of all time, or have insane numbers in all of the other games of a playoff series, but if you can&rsquo;t repeat the effort in those big elimination games, what is the point? You&rsquo;re just another James Harden if that&rsquo;s the case. Though to be fair, he has since performed stellarly in elimination games since but I guess the game gets easier when you have superstar teammates to help you&hellip;</p>

<p>He regrets getting the surgery he did. He&rsquo;s also just straight up better than those guys regardless imo so not the same in that regard either.</p>

      <label for="ldvghgo" class="commentText"><p>Crazy part is he had been battling injuries since Marquette. He had his meniscus removed before ever stepping foot on an nba court which was really controversial. He finally opted for a second surgery right after the 06 chip and it just got worse and worse for him every year.</p>

<p>Like a lot of players we never actually saw his prime. People forget the discussion started to become is Dwyane Wade what we thought LeBron would be? Is HE the best player in the world?</p>

<p>Edit: I remember he said on another podcast he was ready to form the Heatles because he knew it was the only choice he had to prolong his career. He was getting injections in his knee just to play on the road to show appreciation to all the nba fans.</p>

      <label for="ldvmb5q" class="commentText"><p>Yea, it’s definitely eye test, but Wade had much more finesse around the paint and didnt rely on explosiveness as much as D Rose (not saying Wade isn’t explosive).</p>

<p>If anything, it’s the stopping that wore him out. Wade had an insane stopping ability which puts a lot of strain on your knees. Just look at his eurosteps and footwork around defenders to change directions.</p>

<p>Hell, I studied Wade growing up and copied his euros. Can confirm my knees are shot now lol</p>

<p>You also want to prove that you&rsquo;re better than all of your peers at some aspects of ball, and that&rsquo;s generally through hardware.</p>

<p>Best scorer, rebounder, most valuable, etc. And MJ has more hardware than lbj even if you exclude rings.</p>

<p>Im no lbj hater either. I do agree with you and lbj uplifting teams. He&rsquo;s soo fucking good at everything that he can plug any weakness his team has. Need rebounding? Got it. More assists? Np. Scoring too.</p>

<p>Imo he&rsquo;s clearly the greatest FLOOR RAISER in nba history.</p>

<p>However, MJ is the greatest ceiling raiser. Give him comparable talent to any team, and he himself will find some fucking way to make sure you never lose.</p>

<p>During his bull years he felt inevitable&ndash; as in everyone just expected, just KNEW he was going to win.</p>

<p>He psychologically owned the league more than anyone other than maybe bill russell.  Teams would fear facing him lol. Players on opposing teams admitted to getting into fights if one of their teammates talked shit to MJ, and made mj mad lol.</p>

<p>It was complete dominance.</p>

      <label for="ldw3ij0" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that some of the calls were a little on the lighter side.  But the Mavs had zero hope of stopping Wade playing straight up, so he definitely drew a ton of contact that series.  If an athletic guard sees that the refs are calling fouls, he should attack every time.</p>

He could handle the rock, he could pass, he could playmake, he could defend, he could slash, and of course, he could score. He wasn’t goat trajectory, but injuries def did a number on him. Him not really having all that good of a team between his days with Shaq and the Heatles also played a role.</p>

With around 5 rebounds in an era where stats like that weren&rsquo;t inflated like today. Prime Dwade was giving production similar to Kobe and Lebron. Imo he was on that level. I’d give my left pinky toe to see him have a fully healthy career so we could see him maybe challenge Kobe for the spot behind MJ. Even with the injuries everyone still sees him as 3rd. That alone tells you just how damn good he was. </p>

      <label for="ldw1htw" class="commentText"><p>Wade came into the league with lingering knee injuries. Rose was better on offense because of his athleticism but they had similar play styles so who knows how athletic Wade would have been. Rose was also 23 when his injuries took place so allot of his development and peak were stifled. Wade’s defense was second to only Jordan when it comes to shooting guards but yet again, how much better could he have been if he didn’t come into the league with bum knees? Rose was getting better on defense every year but I don’t think he ever would have been up there with Wade and Jordan. Allot of what ifs in this question but I think barring injuries Wade takes it with his defense. The defensive gap between the two I think would be allot bigger than the offensive gap between the two, which is why I’d have to pick Wade. Also as a bonus I’d say without injuries or Lebron joining, both of these guys win at least one more ring at some point as the main guy.</p>

Also having the most success as a robin to LeBron doesn’t help. But Wade was a monster at his best, and hit that level only 2 or 3 seasons into his career. Maybe not the GOAT but if he played at that level for 12 seasons instead of 6ish he coulda been considered top 10.</p>

      <label for="ldwf0pz" class="commentText"><p>offtopic but i think like this about Vince Carter. Could do literally everything, including being a very good shooter from way deep from early on, the most creative and elegant finisher i&rsquo;ve ever seen, a fantastic fade-away, the dunks, the aura&hellip;.not sure what happened there since he had a great career. As for D-wade, man was something else and part of one of the coolest teams in NBA history (including the heat not just with bron but with shaq, and crew of vets like payton , White chocolate, Posey, Alonzo mourning (from the bench), and Mr Shimmy Toine Walker. Not sure about the GOAT stuff since i hate that conversation. One of the best going to the rim bar none.</p>

      <label for="ldvpgut" class="commentText"><p>He didn&rsquo;t really have a chance at GOAT. His shot isn&rsquo;t as good, and his defense is not as good. You could say what if on loads of players with injuries.</p>

<p>That being said even though he got a good whistle in the finals, he never had the whistle that Kobe had. Kobe averaged over 13 FTA twice in his career in the 2000s. That&rsquo;s nuts. Wade only made it over 10 twice and never to 11. There was some clear ass bias for Kobe, who quite honestly is his closest competitor IMO. They have very similar stats in some ways, but Kobe was probably better on D due to those knee issues Wade had.</p>

Prime Wade was an incredible defender.  If all-defense selections weren&rsquo;t just a popularity contest, their numbers would be very close on that front because of how good Wade was even with the shorter career.</p>

<p>i respect ur opinion but i cant see wade as a pippen since he won his first chip as the &ldquo;jordan&rdquo; and even in 2011 he was the best heat player during the finals. he accomplished too much as the guy to be a pippen</p>
