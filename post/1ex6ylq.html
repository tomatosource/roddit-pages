<p>I have another team that I’ll put out there that probably has something to prove: it’s the Miami Heat. This is a big season for them…</p>

<p>The regular season has to matter to them. They aren’t good enough [for it not to matter]. They thought they could do it like the season before where they skated in through the Play-In Tournament then made it into the Finals. It bit them in the ass. I think for them, they actually have to care this season…</p>

You’re telling me that they’re comfortable making the play-in, losing a play-in game, going down in the second one, and THEN decide to flip the switch? That was the plan?</p>

      <label for="lj47ad4" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I could see it happening at some point. Beyond Butler being Butler, the big thing was they had a down year from three, then got absurdly hot from three in both series against their main competitors in the East. Three point shooting - and the variance that comes with it - isn’t going away, I think there’s quite a few teams with underperforming talent that could potentially put that kind of miracle run together in the future.</p>

<p>It’s definitely not something I’d ever expect to see regularly though, they are still a bit of a special case.</p>

<p>Lebron was in 8 straight Finals with Curry as his open in 4. Kobe was in the 3 right before that.  Then Lebron again. Then Shaq.  That’s 13 straight right there. Skip a year then you got Shaq/Kobe. Skip another &amp; you got the Shaq/ Kobe 3peat. Skip another &amp; you got MJ 2nd 3peat.</p>

<p>Giannis, Tim Duncan, &amp; Jokic while great players don’t really move the needle in the viewership department unless they have another Star on the opposite end like TD did with Kobe/Shaq &amp; Lebron</p>

<p>People didn’t tune in for Cavs vs Warriors. They tuned in for Lebron vs Steph. When teams &amp; the NBA  send out promotional emails about tickets it’s LeBron James &amp; the Los Angeles Lakers.  People complain about load management for a reason</p>

      <label for="ljb629j" class="commentText"><p>Crazy Giannis block on Ayton in game 4, the holiday strip of booker up 1 with 20 secs left on game 5 and then the wild alley oop to giannis. How about giannis going for 50, 14, and 5 blocks (I believe only person to ever go 50-10-5 blocks on any playoff game ever) including 17-19 from the line. All against the backdrop of two title-starved fan bases that were going totally nuts the whole time as we were just starting to get fans back live post covid? Lowkey prob one of my favorite series ever.</p>

<p>I would agree that Celtics-mavs and heat-nuggets were both pretty blah. I think the heat were a good defensive team that got hot from 3 and would have blown 3-0 lead to Celtics if Tatum doesn’t turn his ankle at the start of game 7. And then Celtics were a better team and also a terrible matchup for the mavs. Throw in that Tatum is a tier below the level of player we are used to seeing as “best player on a championship team” (LeBron, curry, Jokic, giannis, etc). Both of those series felt like they might be over by halftime of game 1.</p>

<p>The idea that the heat fo doesnt consider the RS important is just a figment of fan&rsquo;s imagination. our record last year had way more to do with injuries than not caring. They definitely feel like they&rsquo;re a better playoff team but that doesnt mean they dont understand that seeding and RS success is important</p>

<p>Sooo he faked an injury while the wolves were a top 4 seed?</p>

<p>No, he didn’t fake his knee injury, it’s just that he didn’t “rush” back.
I’m happy Jimmy grew up and became a leader in Miami, and he’s a great player, but let’s not get it twisted, what he did in Minny was “soft as baby shit” </p>

      <label for="lj4vubs" class="commentText"><p>I think people forget we&rsquo;ve been one of the most injured regular season teams in the NBA for the past two seasons. We are not throwing on purpose, we just don&rsquo;t have our team playing most of the time. Bam is the only player on the team that started more than 60 games last season. The &ldquo;Heat Culture&rdquo; part is not panicking about being a play-in team and still believing it&rsquo;s possible to win every playoff series regardless, not purposefully being a play-in team.</p>

<p>Just to add some context, that year&rsquo;s roster was effectively the same one that shot the 3rd best 3pt% the earlier season. They can shoot, the 22-23 season was slumpy at best but the playoff shooting was kind of a sudden reversion to the mean</p>

<p>It’s because Lakers failed for one reason or another to maximize Bron and AD’s years and the Heat have also failed to maximize Butler/Bam’s potential</p>

<p>Everyone acts like Miami was coasting the whole time.  Herro was hurt, Jimmy was hurt, Lowry was old, Rozier got hurt after we got him. And we were still 4 games away from the 2 seed. And then in the playoffs without Jimmy or Rozier we still did as good against the Celtics as any other team they faced. You’d think 2 Finals and another run to game 7 of the ECF would get them slack for one down season.</p>

<p>Also just ignore the fact that the Heat have been one of the most injured teams in the last two years. It’s not like we are trying to have poor regular seasons or don’t care, that is 100% a media invented myth. Heat culture simply means that the team doesn’t panic over it. Nobody is “fine” with the 8 seed.</p>

<p>The Heat as an organization don’t have anything to prove to this guy. Butler has something to prove, Herro has something to prove, but as an organization, nah.</p>

      <label for="lj7mfsg" class="commentText"><p>No they don&rsquo;t actually, most teams don&rsquo;t play the regular season the way they do the playoffs, not even the Jordan Bulls, there&rsquo;s 82 games you can&rsquo;t bring that intensity for all of those games it&rsquo;s unreasonable to even ask that, every single team has nights where the energy is low and they are coasting, that&rsquo;s what happens with a long regular season in every sport</p>

<p>They are banking on Leonard and Harden plus a bunch of decent but not great role players. I doubt those two can carry them to round 2 let alone playoffs.</p>

<p>They have like not many picks either. They need to cross fingers and hope Leonard stays healthy so they can flip him for picks.</p>

      <label for="lj4cvdf" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not even all too confident in that prediction when you look at the rest of the field. If all teams are healthy, the only ones that are clear cut lesser teams than the Clippers are the Spurs, Blazers and Jazz.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. You can make stronger arguments for everyone else in their division. The Nuggets, Wolves, Mavericks and Thunder are probably the top 4 in the West and they aren&rsquo;t even in this division. Grizzlies had Smart for like 20 games last year, Bane for half the season and Morant played 9(?) games plus Clarke I don&rsquo;t think played at all. That&rsquo;s 4 of their starting lineup sans Jackson. The Pelicans have a starting center problem and the Murray trade if anything is just a lateral move I don&rsquo;t personally like but the Pelicans at the very least have top level starting talent at 4 positions and very good quality reserves. Then you have the Rockets who might be in the same camp placement-wise as not only the Clippers, but also the Lakers and Warriors. Rockets have a solid upward trajectory on their hands and even if they only have a slightly better season than last they can be possible shoe-ins for a 45 win campaign.</p>

      <label for="lj3wgpf" class="commentText"><p>At a certain point though you just need to factor in that we choose to rely on injury laden players. Jimmy has a history of injury and is old. Tyler has a significant history of injury. Thats 2 of 5 starters that take up a significant amount of our cap and does not leave wiggle room for other injuries.</p>

<p>Its like kawhi, you cant just say oh if it werent for injuries we’d be a great team. At this point injuries are what is to be expected for our injury prone players, and then every season a team will have other random injuries. Although last year the random injuries were nuts. So the expectation of being a serious contender is lowered significantly</p>
