<p>I have another team that I’ll put out there that probably has something to prove: it’s the Miami Heat. This is a big season for them…</p>

<p>The regular season has to matter to them. They aren’t good enough [for it not to matter]. They thought they could do it like the season before where they skated in through the Play-In Tournament then made it into the Finals. It bit them in the ass. I think for them, they actually have to care this season…</p>

You’re telling me that they’re comfortable making the play-in, losing a play-in game, going down in the second one, and THEN decide to flip the switch? That was the plan?</p>

      <label for="lj47ad4" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I could see it happening at some point. Beyond Butler being Butler, the big thing was they had a down year from three, then got absurdly hot from three in both series against their main competitors in the East. Three point shooting - and the variance that comes with it - isn’t going away, I think there’s quite a few teams with underperforming talent that could potentially put that kind of miracle run together in the future.</p>

<p>It’s definitely not something I’d ever expect to see regularly though, they are still a bit of a special case.</p>

      <label for="lj4h7lp" class="commentText"><p>Probaly more to do with the star power. Same with Bucks-Suns.  There have been all time great superstars (both in play &amp; brand)  involved with %95 of all Finals since the 70s.</p>

<p>Lebron was in 8 straight Finals with Curry as his open in 4. Kobe was in the 3 right before that.  Then Lebron again. Then Shaq.  That’s 13 straight right there. Skip a year then you got Shaq/Kobe. Skip another &amp; you got the Shaq/ Kobe 3peat. Skip another &amp; you got MJ 2nd 3peat.</p>

<p>Giannis, Tim Duncan, &amp; Jokic while great players don’t really move the needle in the viewership department unless they have another Star on the opposite end like TD did with Kobe/Shaq &amp; Lebron</p>

<p>The idea that the heat fo doesnt consider the RS important is just a figment of fan&rsquo;s imagination. our record last year had way more to do with injuries than not caring. They definitely feel like they&rsquo;re a better playoff team but that doesnt mean they dont understand that seeding and RS success is important</p>

Rozier can be it, Bam can be it, along with Herro&hellip;.Jaquez/Jovic/Highsmith/Burks&hellip;Robinson when he&rsquo;s hot, to me is absolutely solid depth. Ware intriguing young C. The problem is that the top of the East is ridiculously good. It&rsquo;s less that they&rsquo;re mediocre.</p>

Bam isn’t it most nights on offense, which I don’t have as much of a problem with because of how much they ask of him on defense. Terry, Herro, Robinson, all those guys can be really streaky and actually get injured (maybe less with Terry even tho he did get injured).</p>

I watched him fuck up the offense numerous times last season when he’d hold the ball while being passive and then pass it back out and let the rest of them figure it out with significantly less time on the shot clock and never attempt to get back into the play.</p>

<p>The east is too good for them to coast by and to expect to be top 6.</p>

      <label for="lj3ti3n" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the context of last season, they were only a regular season win and a few tiebreakers from getting out of the Play-In entirely (and 4 wins away from the 2-seed).</p>

<p>But they dropped a lot of winnable games (games vs. the Wizards and depleted Grizzlies come immediately to mind), and as a result they end up losing Jimmy in the Play-In game before locking themselves into a lopsided series with the 64-win Celtics.</p>

<p>The fact it was only 5 games and could’ve easily been a sweep was disappointing AF. Plus if I remember correctly, each game except game 2 wasn’t particularly competitive.</p>

      <label for="lj4cvdf" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not even all too confident in that prediction when you look at the rest of the field. If all teams are healthy, the only ones that are clear cut lesser teams than the Clippers are the Spurs, Blazers and Jazz.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. You can make stronger arguments for everyone else in their division. The Nuggets, Wolves, Mavericks and Thunder are probably the top 4 in the West and they aren&rsquo;t even in this division. Grizzlies had Smart for like 20 games last year, Bane for half the season and Morant played 9(?) games plus Clarke I don&rsquo;t think played at all. That&rsquo;s 4 of their starting lineup sans Jackson. The Pelicans have a starting center problem and the Murray trade if anything is just a lateral move I don&rsquo;t personally like but the Pelicans at the very least have top level starting talent at 4 positions and very good quality reserves. Then you have the Rockets who might be in the same camp placement-wise as not only the Clippers, but also the Lakers and Warriors. Rockets have a solid upward trajectory on their hands and even if they only have a slightly better season than last they can be possible shoe-ins for a 45 win campaign.</p>

      <label for="lj3xu2a" class="commentText"><p>This is pretty obvious imo but a lot of harden fans have convinced themselves and everyone else  that the team has improved without PG and that he was the reason the clippers couldn’t get out of the first round.</p>

<p>Big surprise is he wasn’t</p>

      <label for="lj3unos" class="commentText"><p>It’s not needing a superstar. It’s their injuries what gets them. They’re a hospital team every year never at   100% and it’s hard to build good chemistry with 10+ multiple starting lineups.</p>

      <label for="lj3wgpf" class="commentText"><p>At a certain point though you just need to factor in that we choose to rely on injury laden players. Jimmy has a history of injury and is old. Tyler has a significant history of injury. Thats 2 of 5 starters that take up a significant amount of our cap and does not leave wiggle room for other injuries.</p>

<p>Its like kawhi, you cant just say oh if it werent for injuries we’d be a great team. At this point injuries are what is to be expected for our injury prone players, and then every season a team will have other random injuries. Although last year the random injuries were nuts. So the expectation of being a serious contender is lowered significantly</p>
