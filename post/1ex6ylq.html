<p>I have another team that I’ll put out there that probably has something to prove: it’s the Miami Heat. This is a big season for them…</p>

<p>The regular season has to matter to them. They aren’t good enough [for it not to matter]. They thought they could do it like the season before where they skated in through the Play-In Tournament then made it into the Finals. It bit them in the ass. I think for them, they actually have to care this season…</p>

<p>The east is too good for them to coast by and to expect to be top 6.</p>

<p>Though I think Pat Riley knows this considering not so subtle public jabs at Jimmy.</p>

      <label for="lj3ti3n" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the context of last season, they were only a regular season win and a few tiebreakers from getting out of the Play-In entirely (and 4 wins away from the 2-seed).</p>

<p>But they dropped a lot of winnable games (Home games vs. the Wizards and depleted Grizzlies come immediately to mind), and as a result they end up losing Jimmy in the Play-In game before locking themselves into a lopsided series with the 64-win Celtics.</p>

<p>But considering how better the east got and they basically did nothing of value in the offseason they project as a good not great team. I do think they&rsquo;re a bit underrated but they&rsquo;re not in the Knicks/Sixers tier.</p>

<p>They might just not have the horses this year to be more than a play-in team.</p>

<p>They are banking on Leonard and Harden plus a bunch of decent but not great role players. I doubt those two can carry them to round 2 let alone playoffs.</p>

<p>They have like not many picks either. They need to cross fingers and hope Leonard stays healthy so they can flip him for picks.</p>

      <label for="lj3wgpf" class="commentText"><p>At a certain point though you just need to factor in that we choose to rely on injury laden players. Jimmy has a history of injury and is old. Tyler has a significant history of injury. Thats 2 of 5 starters that take up a significant amount of our cap and does not leave wiggle room for other injuries.</p>

<p>Its like kawhi, you cant just say oh if it werent for injuries we’d be a great team. At this point injuries are what is to be expected for our injury prone players, and then every season a team will have other random injuries. Although last year the random injuries were nuts. So the expectation of being a serious contender is lowered significantly</p>
