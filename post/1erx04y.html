      <p>Who is a NBA player, that was not so good during his games, but because of video highlights is now considered as generational talent.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start from Jason Williams.</p>

<p>In many podcasts he is portraited as one of the greatest PG. But in fact he was not so great.</p>

<p>His AST/TO was really low. In play-offs his AST dropped really hard.</p>

<p>There was a reason why SAC traded him for Mike Bibby.</p>

      <label for="li1ssz9" class="commentText"><p>Idk… Jason was a player I’d pay to see him play. I tried to imitate all of his moves and when I made his elbow pass in a game I felt like a god.
I have never watched one of his whole games, so his highlights were the only thing I’ve seen to be honest.
I see some similarities with Ja, he brings something spectacular, but I was wondering the same thing with Ja last year. Yeah, he is exciting to watch, but in my mind and in my opinion, he is not that good, not generational talent, just flashy and fun to watch.
But I do remember Shaq demanding Jason as a teammate and praising him a lot.</p>

<p>SG Gerald Green / Shannon Brown</p>

<p>SF Derrick Jones Jr</p>

<p>PF Kenneth Faried / Antoine Carr</p>

<p>C Darryl Dawkins / Chris Andersen</p>

<p>JR Smith is actually the first come to mind. Dude got some crazy highlights. But he did win a 6MOY and was a legit candidate for a few years. Probably overqualified.</p>

<p>Some of you might be surprised but Kenny Smith in Sacramento fit too. He was known for his dunking highlights every game as a PG when he was younger.</p>
