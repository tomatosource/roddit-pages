      <label for="lr8f5oq" class="commentText"><p>Number 1 is insane to me. He’s a lesser clone of Jordan with lower career averages, fewer career accolades, and one less title. There’s no rational argument for putting him above MJ.  You could then use the exact same arguments when comparing him to LeBron. He has literally no legitimate case for number 1 or 2. Those are on lockdown.</p>

      <label for="lr9t16i" class="commentText"><p>Also I was afraid to say this because this sub would flip out, but a prime harden team would never miss the playoffs or lose in the first round like that. The one time prime harden lost in the first round it was because he had to play the 73 win warriors in the first round. And he was second in mvp. That’s a bit different. Peak harden had some absolutely dogshit rosters in 2017-2020 besides half of 2018 when cp3 was healthy. He won the assists title and was second in scoring, then won three straight scoring titles with all time great playmaking, and led the league in win shares 5 times to drag some of those awful rosters to 50+ wins and carried them to playoff series against usually the eventual champs and made them real series.</p>

<p>In 2017 the rockets were predicted to win 38 games. Harden dragged them to 55.</p>

<p>When harden had to be the only person who could step up he did things like have one of the greatest seasons ever and average 36 ppg while second place was at 28, led the league in threes three years straight, isoed well over double anyone else because that’s all they could do, and he made it the most efficient play in nba history at the time.</p>

<p>When Kobe had to be the only one who could step up his teams sucked.</p>

<p>Even when they won in 2010 Kobe shit the bed in game 7 but his team mates were good enough to carry them. If harden had a below average scoring game in the playoffs it was basically an auto loss.</p>

<p>Harden has better playoff numbers, far better clutch playoff scoring numbers, and better elimination game numbers than Kobe. But he’s a choker and Kobe’s super clutch apparently.</p>

<p>When prime Kobe had rosters similar to harden and things actually got hard, he bitched endlessly and demanded a trade, basically threw a playoff game because Phil asked him to pass and he pouted the rest of the game because he thought it was so unfair he had to play a team with a better roster. harden just killed himself in the regular season hard carrying those teams playing absurd minutes and doing like unprecedented shit on the court just to finally run into a championship team in the playoffs where it just simply wasn’t possible for anyone in history to win with those rosters. And he still took 5 more games off the kd warriors in the playoffs than lebron ever did. Then just get made fun of and called a losing player for his entire career. Despite leading the league in win shares 5 times.</p>

<p>Yet somehow Kobe is the ultimate mamba mentality winning player, and harden was an empty stats foul baiting choker (when harden averaged 36 he averaged 11 fts, when Kobe averaged 35 he averaged 10).</p>

<p>Also can you imagine if on the Kobe shaq teams shaq just completely shit the bed against a team like the spurs? They would lose in like 5 and Kobe would get zero blame.</p>

<p>Post injury harden who was brought in to be a <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> guy to facilitate for the mvp and scoring leader.</p>

<p>Sixers fans to this day act like harden singlehandedly destroyed their chances because he only had 2 40+ point games instead of three. He got them to 7 games against the Celtics in a series no one thought would go that long, and if people had known how embiid was gonna play would’ve assumed it would be a sweep.</p>

<p>Now they’re so happy they have PG instead when just last year harden took a backseat in scoring to make PG have his most efficient season ever at 34 and look like a better scorer. And in the playoffs they legit had to be like hey man I know you like passing and setting up PG, but this is embarrassing. So once again he had to be the first option and easily the best player on the clippers in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lr9r6hw" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was in the west and Lebron was in the east when it was arguably its worst iteration of itself in that decade. For context, from 00-09, 24 East teams achieved 50 wins. For the west, they more than doubled at at 57. There were multiple years where sub .500 teams would make the playoffs in the east and 47 win teams missed the playoffs in the west. Had Kobe played in the east on their schedule in 06, that 45-37 undoubtedly turns into 50-32 at a minimum. His team would have qualified for 4th in the east with that record alone but was 7th in the west. You can’t compare the records at a raw value without the context of the competition in the conferences</p>

<p>Half of the dribbling done in today’s NBA comes from Iverson, half of the league are wearing arm sleeves because Iverson wore one, no one shows up in suits to games etc…</p>

<p>The whole media was actively promoting him as Jordan&rsquo;s heir before he had even approached MVP level.</p>

<p>Now folks act like he wasnt being pulled along in Shaq&rsquo;s wake. &ldquo;Kobe won 5 rings!&rdquo; Horry won 7, a few Celtics besides Russell have 8-10 or whatever.</p>

<p>Kobe led his team to 2.</p>

      <label for="lr75zg7" class="commentText"><p>Isiah Thomas (Detroit). Most people I&rsquo;ve seen put him in 1 of 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Top 3 PG or top 20 all time (beat Jordan Magic Bird) clutch player who carried team to 2 championships, smart skilled and tough</li>
<li>Not even/barely top 50 all time, overrated by accolades, inefficient scorer, won with one of the deepest supporting casts ever and they won because of defense</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Edited in: Fwiw I don&rsquo;t have my own &ldquo;top XX&rdquo; rankings that I argue about since I miss a lot of games, nor do I go hard on advanced stats, but I have him a bit closer to the former after watching. I really value playoff performance, think he was underrated as a defender despite being 6&rsquo;0&rdquo; (disciplined, pesky, fast hands), and it&rsquo;s not like he was chucking/ignoring open teammates all the time either. Excellent playmaker/passer. The Detroit team definitely did win on defense/depth and he had some efficiency problems, but overall he did a good job as a leader of the offense all things considered.</em></p>

Ofc almost all will say curry but really you could say cp3 would be a better fit on some teams and it would be true.  Like clippers were on par every adv stat with 2014 spurs. I dont think curry makes the team better then cp3.  Their fits are just so different and really i think thats just the case with curry vs any star player really. Only klay rip reggie curry </p>

      <label for="lr9rqzx" class="commentText"><p>Imo, besides not considering him a pg, I think people are not being honest about how much of golden state&rsquo;s golden years were thanks to Dray, Klay (and iggy to some extent) and KD. I think they win all those chips with CP3 instead of steph and probably more convincingly as well. Steph is the GOAT shooter, but other than that I&rsquo;m just not seeing it. His playmaking isn&rsquo;t even close to CP3&rsquo;s; his defense is mediocre at best, but more often than not it&rsquo;s just an obvious weak point, whereas CP3 is arguably the GOAT defensive point guard. Even if you argue offense favors Curry (which I don&rsquo;t agree with, because CP3 creates more for his team than curry puts on the board), he gets eclipsed by CP3 on the other half of the game.</p>

<p>Paul was 1 injury-free game away from beating the best version of the warriors/team that ever existed. Harden might have been an absolute stud, but Curry had KD, Dray and Klay on his team.</p>

<p>Rings just don&rsquo;t paint a fully accurate picture of a single players value</p>

<p>According to Cassell, Jordan said:</p>

      <label for="lr7g75r" class="commentText"><p>The Bulls front court was weak between the three-peats. They had lost Horace Grant but hadn’t gotten Rodman yet. Having Rodman was a huge help
in the series next year.</p>

<p>Without a Rodman or Grant type front court presence, I don’t think the Bulls would’ve won either of those season the Rockets won even with MJ</p>

<ul>
<li>For the most part they never saw him play and rely purely on stats<br>
</li>
<li>They give no credit to Rudy Tomjanovich and the inside out system he implemented which a) was ahead of its time, b) was perfect for the Rockets personnel, and c) perfectly enabled Hakeem in an era of one on one defence<br>
</li>
<li>They seem to forget that Clyde Drexler played for the Rockets in their second championship run<br>
</li>

<p>All of which said, Hakeem is one of the best players of all time. He&rsquo;s just become a <em>bit</em> too highly rated imo, and seems to be considered much better now than he was at the time</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re also ignoring that while he had a great coach, he also had generally weak supporting casts after the Twin Towers team blew up.  His best teammate for almost ten years was Otis Thorpe.  His first title he had good role players around him, but no one really even resembled a second star.  You mention the offensive scheme - it was so effective in large part because of Hakeem.  Pop an average center in there and it&rsquo;s nowhere near as good.</p>

<p>Heck, you yourself are ignoring the whole Twin Towers phase, too.</p>

<p>Dude was seen as around the same level as Ewing and Robinson (two other all timer centers) until he broke through by winning two chips.  Man&rsquo;s top 10, easy.</p>

<p>The best players of that era including Jordan and Shaq both rate him as one of the greatest centres ever.</p>

And even then he couldn&rsquo;t handle the egos of Scottie and Barkley at all when they were together. I think that people that underrate Dream are the ones who never watched him dominate live. Also Hakeem was almost always doubled as soon as he got the ball so not exactly one on one while he was on offense.</p>

<p>Around when Hakeem retired, he was 12th place on SLAM&rsquo;s Top 75 players ever. They did a Top 500 in 2011 with Hakeem moving down to 13th with Duncan moving ahead. That&rsquo;s approximately where most people have him today.</p>

<p>I think the biggest problem when judging Hakeem is people almost solely based his entire career around 1994 and 1995. Him leading the Rockets in his sophomore year under the high tempo Bill Fitch offense  through the Prime Magic led Lakers isn&rsquo;t talked about enough. Him holding his own against, arguably, the greatest team in NBA history at the time isn&rsquo;t talked about enough.  His evolution as a player isn&rsquo;t talked about enough. People don&rsquo;t forget Clyde Drexler existed in his 2nd run. People just acknowledge Hakeem was the far and away best player of that team.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand bringing up Rudy T to diminish Hakeem&rsquo;s greatness. For sure, he helped build a team that would allow Hakeem to succeed. But why does that matter? A coach can only do/implement so much.</p>

<p>A big reason why people are starting to better rate and value players today is because we have access to a lot more data and footage that wasn&rsquo;t available before. We&rsquo;re better able to see and analyze things we couldn&rsquo;t before. The way we interpret value has also changed.</p>

<p>An example is <a href="https://thinkingbasketball.net/2018/03/25/backpicks-goat-hakeem-olajuwon/" target="_blank">Ben Taylor&rsquo;s 2018 evaluation of Hakeem Olajuwon</a> which got down to the nitty gritty impact of his game. We see things that data doesn&rsquo;t pick up (and honestly most things that people saw, they wouldn&rsquo;t remember.) We saw Hakeem Olajuwon playing help defense that we love to value in today&rsquo;s game. From coming from the weak-side to help his man to rotating and recovering back to Bill Cartwright and contested his shot and being able to block him. There&rsquo;s his data and video records allowing us to just how valuable he was even passed his outrageous numbers.  That&rsquo;s just some examples that are available. It basically allows us to go back and better evaluate players than sitting here and trying to  remember how exactly he performed almost 30 years ago.</p>

<p>His All Time ranking also comes down a lot to who&rsquo;s rating him. A lot of people judge All Time records like a resume ala &ldquo;what have you done in your career.&rdquo; Team awards aside, he was also a 6x All NBA 1st team player in an era dominated by centers. 12x All NBA overall, 9x All Defense, 2x DPOTY, 1x MVP is a pretty elite resume.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to diminish Hakeem by bringing up Rudy T. I see too many people ignore Tomjanovich completely, saying that Hakeem singlehandedly dragged a bunch of scrubs to the title, overlooking the importance of Rudy and his scheme in enabling and unleashing Hakeem (whilst also maximising the other Rockets personnel)</p>

I recall people saying that Pippen wouldn&rsquo;t be anything if not for Jordan. Great to see so many people giving him his flowers lately. It is interesting to see how someones reputation changes with time, and I really think looking back on it, people start to see how special he was as an all around player (scoring, defending, passing, rebounding)</p>

<p>I always hate this argument because Kyrie based a portion of his game on AI. There are a lot of players that would be really good in previous eras just because foreknowledge of the era you&rsquo;re joining is so valuable.</p>

<p>But KD is pretty clearly better than Kobe, I don’t think that’s that controversial. What confuses me though is that kd is largely considered so good for being like the scoring god. If prime harden became a better scorer, a better iso scorer, and was also an all time great floor general, plus has a bigger impact on winning by any metrics (dude led the league in win shares 5 times).</p>

<p>Why is kd over harden considered a ridiculous debate? And just to piss you guys off if kd is better than Kobe…</p>

But Harden has 0 rings and honestly, his era of domination lasted half as long as guys from list above so that is primary reason why you can&rsquo;t put him near KD who has been dominating the league since 2008 and never stopped + wherever he came, he was the best player on the team.</p>

He was top 3 in mvp <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> times, led the league in win shares 5 times, led the league in VORP 3 times, and took KDs ultimate skill and got better at it winning three scoring titles in a row with an absurd number of points, plus isoing well over double the amount kd did and not only being the best iso scorer, but a harden iso was literally the most efficient play in history at the time.</p>

<p>Also you realize harden didn’t die after his hamstring right. He’s still putting up <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> every year was the best player on the sixers in the playoffs in 2022, and the best player on the clippers last year.</p>

      <label for="lr81ypx" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s what they mean. People tend to rank Karl Malone as a person. I think it&rsquo;s a little different with him tho. There&rsquo;s literally zero ambiguity, the man is a pedophile. With Kobe and Drose there was at least some kind of controversy around it</p>

      <label for="lr7rcp9" class="commentText"><p>Kobe went from properly rated shortly after he retired (~6th to ~10th) to overrated after his death (1st to ~5th) and now has swung the other way to underrated (out of the top 10).  I simply don’t see the argument when people put Duncan at like 5 and then Kobe at 12.  Their resume is almost identical, and I feel like they can’t be more than 2 spots apart on any decent list.  If you like Duncan, put him at 7 and Kobe at 9 or something.  If you like Kobe switch them around.  Or just have them next to each other and say 7, 8a, 8b, 10.</p>

Yeah there’s arguments for Duncan being higher than Kobe and I think I would put Duncan over Kobe but to say Duncan is T7 and Kobe is out of the T10 just isn’t defendable</p>

      <label for="lr9qaen" class="commentText"><p>Duncan is probably the worst example you could use.</p>

<p>Duncan is the epitome of ‘the stats don’t tell the whole story’ because he did what was needed of him at the Spurs and was still clearly the best player in the league for at least 2 seasons.</p>

<p>Kobe was a player where ‘the scoring doesn’t tell the whole story’ because he probably could have been a better player if he played to his abilities. He was never once the clear best player in the league.</p>

<p>Duncan’s stats and individual accolades could have been better, but he liked to win. Kobe’s individual stats should have been lower and more efficient and he would have probably done better but he liked to score.</p>

<p>If you are a GM starting a team and you pick Kobe over Duncan knowing their careers you are fired immediately. Duncan is at the bottom end of the top 8 or so proper All-timers and Kobe is in the middle of the 9-15 or so phenomenal players.</p>

<p>He could be argued as the league&rsquo;s best all time guard until Magic/Jordan claimed the crown in the late 80s.</p>

<p>For more modern players I think Kobe is just the one that stands out as far as being all over the place, the one I see the most is that he&rsquo;s the second greatest player of all time because there&rsquo;s really not a case for him above Jordan but he&rsquo;s the closest thing to it, I&rsquo;ve seen very few people passionately try to say that he is the goat, and generally speaking I&rsquo;ve seen him ranked on lists from like 2 to 13, I think as far as this current crop of players, all time kawhi Leonard is going to have a crazy polarizing legacy</p>

<p>But if you ask the general population to provide a top 15, plenty of people might leave out Oscar and Mikan while some oldheads would have em top 5! That’s a huge range.</p>

<p>I bet there&rsquo;s people with George Gervin in the top 40, and others who straight up wouldn&rsquo;t have him in their top 100. I think the real answer to this is probably someone like that, who is never getting higher than like 37 even on their biggest fan&rsquo;s list.</p>

But due to various reasons (no rings, bad in clutch moments, being fed by Stockton, being a terrible person) he sometimes gets ranked below all the other great PFs. I&rsquo;ve seen him as low as 50 in some rankings which is insane.</p>

<p>Sometimes, he is in Top 3. Sometimes in Middle of Top 10. Sometimes in the end of Top 10. Heck, Reddit r/nba mostly even put him just outside of top 10.</p>

      <label for="lr9lewh" class="commentText"><p>There’s a fair few players that rank as high as top 20 and then are left off plenty of top 50 lists, but that’s to be expected given the ridiculous depth and history of the league.</p>

<p>But for me, it’s Kobe. The generation that grew up with Kobe as the face of the league are currently in their 30s-40s and really dominate the media conversation and that’s filtered down into the newer Facebook generation. It’s pretty common to see Kobe talked about as a top 3-5 player which is just absurd. His absolute peak is around 10th and realistically he’s somewhere between there and 15th which is phenomenal, but there have been a LOT of phenomenal players in the NBA.</p>

<p>I see the gap between top 3 and 15th as pretty clear, whereas as there are probably 100 players that you could reasonably argue fit between ~15th and ~50th</p>

      <label for="lr9nez8" class="commentText"><p>On the top end probably Kobe. There are probably other players with wider spreads but there are people who place Kobe in their GOAT argument and act like people are completely crazy when they don&rsquo;t despite almost every other &ldquo;source&rdquo; labeling him as a fringe top 10 guy. Ranking 8-14 or so is basically just splitting hairs, but we have people who constantly lump him in that top 3 and it just seems like quite the reach.</p>

<p>Overall probably Isiah Thomas. His career comparison if we just view all players equally is MAYBE a top 50 all-time career. But we have people arguing him for top 20, I&rsquo;ve heard the question asked on NBA Radio &ldquo;are we underrating Zeke for not mentioning him in our top 10&rdquo;.. Personally I feel like his career might be the most overrated in league history and his rankings tend to vary quite a bit because of that.</p>
