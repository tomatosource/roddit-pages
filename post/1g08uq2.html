There’s no rational argument for putting him above MJ.  You could then use the exact same arguments when comparing him to LeBron. He has literally no legitimate case for number 1 or 2. Those are on lockdown.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the one major thing that separates them and is why a lot of people view him as the absolute peak of a chucker.</p>

<p>The real answer are the 60s players like Wilt, Bill Russell and Oscar where fans are split between dismissing them for playing against weaker competition or glorifying them for their influence to the sport</p>

Among objective studied people who know what they’re talking about, more people would have him outside the top 20 than inside the top 5.</p>

      <label for="lr8ipna" class="commentText"><p>Ok, but he had 0 years where he was the top player regular season and postseason combined, that’s a lot more crucial than MVPs. I don’t even see a year where he’s top 2. And this sub doesn’t “hate Kobe”. They’re just more educated than typical casual fans. That’s why they  have him borderline top 10. If you find somewhere that’s more educated still, they’ll go more like borderline top 15.</p>

<p>Overall points means nothing. Karl Malone’s #3 all-time. If anything, it’s just indicative of how Kobe was generally a ball hog and was willing to shoot over a double team instead of finding the open man, limiting his efficiency and neutering his incredible passing skill.</p>

<p>If Kobe would have just not tried to do all these things he’s lauded for (35 PPG in a season, 81 points in a game, 4th all-time in career points), and passed to the open man for 10% of his shots instead, his legend would be less and less people would consider him top 5, but he would probably actually deserve to be top 15 if not top 10.</p>

<p>As a biased laker fan I think you can put him anywhere from 4-10 and not look crazy, outside the top 20 is insane though and there’s no metric or qualification you can use to put him outside there.</p>

<p>With older players like Bill Russell you can argue, smaller league, the quality was far worse and players now are better to make an argument against them. You can’t do this with Kobe.</p>

      <label for="lr8l3up" class="commentText"><p>Bruh, I swear it’s these little kids and advanced stats, fantasy basketball nerds who say this nonsense. I mean I get it, but Olajuwon played in a league with Kareem, Parish, Ewing, David Robinson, and Shaq. That doesn’t even count the defensive oriented bigs like Mutumbo and Mourning—to name just two. Olajuwon dominated his matchup with all these players and consistently anchored his defenses (mind you while fasting for Ramadan during playoff runs). I think the world of Joker and he’s earned my respect and attention as a basketball fan, but he hasn’t passed Olajuwon—not until he can prove to me he can dominate the game on defense.</p>

<p>Yes, Joker has deeper shooting range and he’s a great passer, but so was Olajuwon. That was the key to why his title teams were so good, because of his passing out of the double team.</p>

<p>I’m convinced anyone who says Joker has passed Olajuwon never watched Dream play.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the most part they never saw him play and rely purely on stats<br>
</li>
<li>They give no credit to Rudy Tomjanovich and the inside out system he implemented which a) was ahead of its time, b) was perfect for the Rockets personnel, and c) perfectly enabled Hakeem in an era of one on one defence<br>
</li>
<li>They seem to forget that Clyde Drexler played for the Rockets in their second championship run<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>All of which said, Hakeem is one of the best players of all time. He&rsquo;s just become a <em>bit</em> too highly rated imo, and seems to be considered much better now than he was at the time</p>

His best teammate for almost ten years was Otis Thorpe.  His first title he had good role players around him, but no one really even resembled a second star.  You mention the offensive scheme - it was so effective in large part because of Hakeem.  Pop an average center in there and it&rsquo;s nowhere near as good.</p>

<p>Heck, you yourself are ignoring the whole Twin Towers phase, too.</p>

<p>Dude was seen as around the same level as Ewing and Robinson (two other all timer centers) until he broke through by winning two chips.  Man&rsquo;s top 10, easy.</p>

      <label for="lr7rvuq" class="commentText"><p>I think we&rsquo;re both making similar points - the offensive scheme succeeded because of Hakeem, and Hakeem was optimised by the scheme. It was win win. Used in a traditional scheme for the time with less spacing Hakeem would have been (and was previously) great, but the offensive scheme took him and the Rockets team to the next level.</p>

<p>Agreed about the Twin Towers - a powerhouse that was sadly cut short.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Hakeem wasn&rsquo;t great - he was amazing - but I think he&rsquo;s become a bit overrated by some. I&rsquo;d have him top 20 easily, probably top 15, but there are some who have him top 5 and ahead of players who were transcendent and literally changed the game. That&rsquo;s where I think Hakeem has become a bit overrated in the modern era.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s fair, but it&rsquo;s the kind of thing you could say about a lot of great teams. It applies to Hakeem, but it also applies to MJ / the Kobe Shaq Lakers and the Triangle, Steph and Kerr&rsquo;s system, etc.</p>

<p>Yup. By injuries and lots of coke lol.</p>

<p>I think realistically he could be top 6 - 15 and I wouldn&rsquo;t argue too much.</p>

<p>Which in a way is odd because I always saw Rudy T as implementing an innovative inside out scheme which was similar to the much lauded system used by Van Gundy with the Dwight Howard Magic.</p>

      <label for="lr8bean" class="commentText"><p>Every single coach in the NBA runs a scheme to help their best player who benefits. That is the worst argument to keep Hakeem out I’ve ever heard. Especially when half the people you probably have above Hakeem have similar level of coaches.</p>

<p>It also way overstates the value of coaches who on a team with a superstar are basically ALWAYS building their offense around the superstar to maximize their abilities. You really think other coaches wouldn’t have changed their scheme to maximize the greatest center in the league/decade at the time?</p>

<p>It’s like saying Jalen Brunson isn’t that good because Thibs built the offense around him. Like no, Thibs built the offense around Jalen Brunson because he’s that good.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s also just against NBA history, if coaches matter so much why do great coaches sometimes coach awful teams but great players almost never end up on awful teams? If Rudy was so great why didn’t he do anything post or pre Hakeem? His entire resume is basically just Hakeem lol.</p>

And even then he couldn&rsquo;t handle the egos of Scottie and Barkley at all when they were together. I think that people that underrate Dream are the ones who never watched him dominate live. Also Hakeem was almost always doubled as soon as he got the ball so not exactly one on one while he was on offense.</p>

<p>seems to be considered much better now than he was at the time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Around when Hakeem retired, he was 12th place on SLAM&rsquo;s Top 75 players ever. They did a Top 500 in 2011 with Hakeem moving down to 13th with Duncan moving ahead. That&rsquo;s approximately where most people have him today.</p>

<p>I think the biggest problem when judging Hakeem is people almost solely based his entire career around 1994 and 1995. Him leading the Rockets in his sophomore year under the high tempo Bill Fitch offense  through the Prime Magic led Lakers isn&rsquo;t talked about enough. Him holding his own against, arguably, the greatest team in NBA history at the time isn&rsquo;t talked about enough.  His evolution as a player isn&rsquo;t talked about enough. People don&rsquo;t forget Clyde Drexler existed in his 2nd run. People just acknowledge Hakeem was the far and away best player of that team.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand bringing up Rudy T to diminish Hakeem&rsquo;s greatness. For sure, he helped build a team that would allow Hakeem to succeed. But why does that matter? A coach can only do/implement so much.</p>

<p>A big reason why people are starting to better rate and value players today is because we have access to a lot more data and footage that wasn&rsquo;t available before. We&rsquo;re better able to see and analyze things we couldn&rsquo;t before. The way we interpret value has also changed.</p>

<p>An example is <a href="https://thinkingbasketball.net/2018/03/25/backpicks-goat-hakeem-olajuwon/" target="_blank">Ben Taylor&rsquo;s 2018 evaluation of Hakeem Olajuwon</a> which got down to the nitty gritty impact of his game. We see things that data doesn&rsquo;t pick up (and honestly most things that people saw, they wouldn&rsquo;t remember.) We saw Hakeem Olajuwon playing help defense that we love to value in today&rsquo;s game. From coming from the weak-side to help his man to rotating and recovering back to Bill Cartwright and contested his shot and being able to block him. There&rsquo;s his data and video records allowing us to just how valuable he was even passed his outrageous numbers.  That&rsquo;s just some examples that are available. It basically allows us to go back and better evaluate players than sitting here and trying to  remember how exactly he performed almost 30 years ago.</p>

<p>His All Time ranking also comes down a lot to who&rsquo;s rating him. A lot of people judge All Time records like a resume ala &ldquo;what have you done in your career.&rdquo; Team awards aside, he was also a 6x All NBA 1st team player in an era dominated by centers. 12x All NBA overall, 9x All Defense, 2x DPOTY, 1x MVP is a pretty elite resume.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to diminish Hakeem by bringing up Rudy T. I see too many people ignore Tomjanovich completely, saying that Hakeem singlehandedly dragged a bunch of scrubs to the title, overlooking the importance of Rudy and his scheme in enabling and unleashing Hakeem (whilst also maximising the other Rockets personnel)</p>

      <label for="lr7l1fj" class="commentText"><p>I unironically think Dream has an argument for being the GOAT. He had no help so less team success but he could do everything important on the court better than almost anyone else could do just that part of their game. He has the greatest footwork as a big, best post offense, and best interior defense. Being the best big of all time means you can dominate in any era. Even considering he played four years in college (in which he made 3 straight final fours) he&rsquo;s still all time in the NBA: #1 in blocks, #10 in steals, #13 in points, and #14 in rebounds. While not playing with modern medicine or in a high possessions per game era. For reference Lebron who is also considered one of the greatest all around players (though he hasn&rsquo;t won DPOY even once) has played 12,378 more minutes and is #80 in blocks, #8 in steals, #1 in points, and #30 in rebounds. AND Hakeem was a black muslim from Nigeria, I watched him not get stats counted correctly due to what has to be assumed as bias from opposing stat counters while playing away games. He is the definition of a player you can&rsquo;t stop so you just have to hope his teammates all sucked that night, sadly they often did, luckily that still didn&rsquo;t always matter. My GOAT.</p>

      <label for="lr75zg7" class="commentText"><p>Isiah Thomas (Detroit). Most people I&rsquo;ve seen put him in 1 of 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Top 3 PG or top 20 all time (beat Jordan Magic Bird) clutch player who carried team to 2 championships, smart skilled and tough</li>
<li>Not even/barely top 50 all time, overrated by accolades, inefficient scorer, won with one of the deepest supporting casts ever and they won because of defense</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Edited in: Fwiw I don&rsquo;t have my own &ldquo;top XX&rdquo; rankings that I argue about since I miss a lot of games, nor do I go hard on advanced stats, but I have him a bit closer to the former after watching. I really value playoff performance, think he was underrated as a defender despite being 6&rsquo;0&rdquo; (disciplined, pesky, fast hands), and it&rsquo;s not like he was chucking/ignoring open teammates all the time either. Excellent playmaker/passer. The Detroit team definitely did win on defense/depth and he had some efficiency problems, but overall he did a good job as a leader of the offense all things considered.</em></p>

      <label for="lr7rpdc" class="commentText"><p>This take is ludicrous. The logical take is that KG is above Dirk. I could imagine an argument for considering Dirk above him (if you put a huge emphasis on offense over defense), but the idea of KG over Dirk being ludicrous is itself ludicrous.</p>

<p>KG would be a hall of fame player on his offense alone, and on top of that he&rsquo;s one of the best defensive players of all time. Dirk actually IS a hall of fame player on his offense alone, but would be nowhere near the hall of fame based on his defense.</p>

      <label for="lr80289" class="commentText"><p>Ludicrous eh?  Dirk pre-prime Dirk torched prime KG&rsquo;s head in a clean sweep in the playoffs.  So much is always said about the elite defense of KG, yet Dirk had no problem averaging 33+pts 15+rebs and 3 steals on him in the playoffs against his prime.  KG got his lone title ring chasing,and was the 2/3rd best player on his team during that finals.  Dirk&rsquo;s ring is not only more impressive, but it&rsquo;s really not much of an argument that his first title was ripped away from a rigged 2006 series ever since the Tim Donaghy saga unfolded.  So yeah I&rsquo;ll use that IF, if we&rsquo;re using ifs for KG. Ludacris 🙄</p>

And he is one of the greatest defensive players of all time. His versatility, effort on both ends, and tenacity makes him one of the greatest. The only reason he isn&rsquo;t discussed as one of the &ldquo;<sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub> top 10 players&rdquo; is because he was drafted by timberwolves that were an expansion teams a couple seasons ago, and spent his early years AND prime being loyal to a low market, no talent, no ambition franchise.</p>

<p>But KD is pretty clearly better than Kobe, I don’t think that’s that controversial. What confuses me though is that kd is largely considered so good for being like the scoring god. If prime harden became a better scorer, a better iso scorer, and was also an all time great floor general, plus has a bigger impact on winning by any metrics (dude led the league in win shares 5 times).</p>

<p>Why is kd over harden considered a ridiculous debate? And just to piss you guys off if kd is better than Kobe…</p>

I simply don’t see the argument when people put Duncan at like 5 and then Kobe at 12.  Their resume is almost identical, and I feel like they can’t be more than 2 spots apart on any decent list.  If you like Duncan, put him at 7 and Kobe at 9 or something.  If you like Kobe switch them around.  Or just have them next to each other and say 7, 8a, 8b, 10.</p>

      <label for="lr7yn51" class="commentText"><p>The narrative on him has been changing for the better in recent years. 20 years ago many people were negative on Pippen. I recall people saying that Pippen wouldn&rsquo;t be anything if not for Jordan. Great to see so many people giving him his flowers lately. It is interesting to see how someones reputation changes with time, and I really think looking back on it, people start to see how special he was as an all around player (scoring, defending, passing, rebounding)</p>

<p>3x MVP, 1x Nba Champ &amp; Finals MVP, 12x All Star (13 counting the ABA), 4 All NBA 1st teams, 4 all NBA second teams. Bunch of other accolades, averaged <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> for his career and averaged <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> for his prime of 77-89 including a <sup>31</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> season. He&rsquo;s 9th in career points, 3rd in career rebounds, 2nd in career FT&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Also the first player to go pro straight from high school.</p>

<p>Guy has top 15-20 credentials if you ask me and he often gets forgotten when talking about all timers.</p>

<p>For more modern players I think Kobe is just the one that stands out as far as being all over the place, the one I see the most is that he&rsquo;s the second greatest player of all time because there&rsquo;s really not a case for him above Jordan but he&rsquo;s the closest thing to it, I&rsquo;ve seen very few people passionately try to say that he is the goat, and generally speaking I&rsquo;ve seen him ranked on lists from like 2 to 13, I think as far as this current crop of players, all time kawhi Leonard is going to have a crazy polarizing legacy</p>

      <label for="lr7ouaj" class="commentText"><p>Malone. Arguably, he has a case for being a top 15 player, at least from a statistical point of view. But due to various reasons (no rings, bad in clutch moments, being fed by Stockton, being a terrible person) he sometimes gets ranked below all the other great PFs. I&rsquo;ve seen him as low as 50 in some rankings which is insane.</p>

<p>Highest Variance I ever saw.</p>

<p>Sometimes, he is in Top 3. Sometimes in Middle of Top 10. Sometimes in the end of Top 10. Heck, Reddit r/nba mostly even put him just outside of top 10.</p>
