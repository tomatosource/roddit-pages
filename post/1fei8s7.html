      <p>The White Sox have won only 33 games. If they lose the remaining games they&rsquo;ll finish with a win % of .204. In the NBA, 35 teams have finished with this win % or lower. If you were to only include teams that played an 82 game season that is still <strong>29 teams</strong> in NBA history with a worse winning % than if the White Sox lost all their remaining games. That&rsquo;s despite the fact that NBA has only been around for 77 years while MLB for at least 155 years (124 of modern history).</p>

      <label for="lmnmgty" class="commentText"><p>The best MLB record ever is like 71% win rate for the season.  Tim Duncan never did worse than that for his whole career.</p>

<p>Basketball is arguably the least random major sport just due to how the scoring works.  If teams are averaging 100 points a game, even a single 3+1 play is only worth 1/25th of your teams score, and a simple bucket is 1/50th.  Baseball not only has an average score of 5ish for a good team, but a single hit can even score multiple runs at once.</p>

      <label for="lmp7ojl" class="commentText"><p>I think your comparison is slightly off since you&rsquo;re saying that the NBA has scoring <em>chances</em> every 20 seconds. Every at bat is a scoring chance (just hit homers, duh), so it&rsquo;s not right to say that they go without generating one scoring chance. They get a minimum of 27 scoring chances (3 outs and 9 innings). But plenty of games do finish with teams scoring zero runs. Meanwhile, could you imagine an NBA team going 0/27?</p>

      <label for="lmobtle" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s not so much because of how scoring works but rather how much influence a single player can have over the game that the NBA has so little variance.</p>

<p>A superstar matters more in basketball than any other team sport.</p>

<p>Soccer also has an average score of 5ish, but there is way less randomness there than in baseball. There is more randomness in soccer than basketball, 11v5 players on the court/field, but you still see the same teams dominate leagues and win year after year.</p>

      <label for="lmnllhq" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s no more luck based than any other sport.  Any team can win in any of the major sports for a single game.</p>

<p>The big X factor in baseball is pitching.  There&rsquo;s no other team sport where one player can single handedly win a game with a dominant performance.  (or lose a game with a terrible one)</p>

<p>In baseball, you pitch a shutout and your team is winning the game so long as your hitters don&rsquo;t shit their pants for 9 innings.  In basketball, one player can score 50 points and their team still loses <em>very easily</em>.</p>

<p>The reverse is also true - one shitty outing by a pitcher can give a team the game.  If a basketball player shits the bed and shoots 0-13, their team can still win.  But if a pitcher gives up 8 runs in the first two innings, their team is losing 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Even bad pitchers have good days and good pitchers have bad days, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really hard to lose 80% of your games in baseball.</p>

      <label for="lmnop2c" class="commentText"><p>On the other hand, basketball has ~<del>100</del>(edit: ~200, forgot that pace just counts one team) possessions per game, baseball has only 54-70ish plate appearances per game. Any individual baseball game has a smaller sample size of events, so that increases the variance.</p>

<p>The outcome of plate appearances are also very affected by previous PAs. Whether or not there’s another runner on base and the amount of outs affects how the current plate appearance will turn out (a single can go from scoring nothing to scoring 3 depending on context). Basketball does have some influence from previous possessions (defense leading to transition buckets being the big one), but making a three results in 3 points regardless of any previous possession. The same cannot be said for a hit in baseball. Baseball events are less independent than basketball events, leading to larger variances in any given game</p>

The best season of all time in baseball was 116 wins, .716 win percentage which equates to a 58 win team in the NBA, which happens all the time.  The White Sox are historically bad and still nowhere near the worst winning percentages seen in the NBA. The worst team in the league beating the best team in the league in baseball is far more likely than that happening in the NBA.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t true at all, unless a guy has like 20+ K&rsquo;s, a shutout is a team defense effort, and as Mariner&rsquo;s fans are very well aware, having your offense not shit the bed isn&rsquo;t a given.</p>

<p>The difference is that baseball has just a handful of scoring events in most games, and other sports have far more, and unlike say, soccer or hockey, other sports that are more luck based than basketball and American football, a single swing of the bat can score more runs than your opponent&rsquo;s offense scores in a whole game on average. The larger the potential impact of a single pitch, or shot attempt, the more luck based a sport is going to be.</p>

Imagine if an NFL team had to change starting QBs every week, would you be surprised that teams W/L records were in a tighter cluster at the end of the year?</p>

      <label for="lmorqw2" class="commentText"><p>There’s just naturally more parity in the game of baseball than in football or basketball. It’s nothing for a Hall of Fame baseball player in his prime to look like trash for a whole month. If a team goes 100-62 they may finish with the best record in baseball. In football 10-6 teams have missed the playoffs. In basketball that 50-32 has been the 8 seed before.</p>

      <label for="lmpbkqv" class="commentText"><p>Until the Wild Card, that was possible and probably happened more than once. Had the second best record in all of baseball that year and missed the playoffs.</p>

<p>In any case though, in a normal year these days, winning <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of your games can get you the best record in baseball, not always but often. It never gets you the best record in football or basketball though.</p>
