      <label for="ll8s2cw" class="commentText"><p>AA big reason why they discredit his rings though is because he left and failed to win again.  People forget, but his reputation was actually pretty solid by 2018-2019.  People were pissed about the move, but they also were ready to crown him as arguably the best player in the world after the btb finals MVPs.  Plus at the time, his numbers painted him as the best player on that Warriors team, making it seem like they needed him to win chips, not the other way around.  </p>

<p>Once he left and the world saw he wasn’t an instant kingmaker, his reputation tanked again with the whole busrider narrative.  </p>

And the NBA has gotten significantly bigger with significantly more talented guys coming into the league every year.  I love KD and he will always be a great to me and the generation of viewers that exist today, but he has not done anything to be mentioned as an all-time great 100 years from now.  To think that is a product of immense personal bias and a lack of imagination what the next 100 years will have in store</p>

<p>If anything I think it made it better, he was the only one on that team who consistently showed up and despite playing with Kyrie at his most mentally unstable and an injured Harden he was basically an inch away from almost knocking out the eventual champions and dropped 48 in a game 7.</p>

<p>I feel like him leaving perfectly summed up his legacy, he&rsquo;s a baller through and through, and despite what the team situation is he&rsquo;s going to show up and play at a high level regardless of what&rsquo;s going on off the court. he&rsquo;s just a guy who likes basketball and is really good at it.</p>

When they hear Kevin Durant, they&rsquo;ll remember his legacy with the warriors. There will be people bringing up that fact up from time to time on reddit, but it really won&rsquo;t be as impactful since most of them never really got to see that KD.</p>

<p>2016
Kawhi:
Led the Spurs in scoring on 62% TS taking them to an insane 67 win record, the 7th best of all time. All while winning the DPOY. </p>

<p>LeBron was still prime LeBron and led the Cavs to the top spot in the East.</p>

<p>2019
Paul George was the 2nd leading scorer in the league above KD. He was also 3rd in DPOY and MVP voting that year. OKC outperformed that year. </p>

<p>Giannis was MVP</p>

<p>But if you actually go down year-by-year you can see why. Was LeBron the objective best player in the entire league for a whole hell of a lot more than 4 seasons? Yep, but because these are seasonal awards with their own specific conditions, these things just happen.</p>

<p>Kobe and Duncan were the best players of the 2000s and won 3 MVPs combined.</p>

<p>Giannis has been in the argument for best player in the league since 2019 but has only gotten the 2.</p>

<p>Right now it seems like Jokic could win MVP every year but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we just saw his last or he only gets one more. Luka, Shai and others are knocking on the door</p>

I think 18’ is a stretch but I would have given him the mvp in 20’. 60 something win pace in a significantly harder conference. Giannis advanced metrics were through the roof but his minutes being slightly down fucked with a lot of them because they look through a per/36 minute pace regardless of possessions.</p>

<p>2018, Harden team won 67 games and finished 1 overall. James team won 50 and finished 4th in the East.</p>

<p>2006: nah if anyone got robbed it’s Kobe.</p>

<p>2020: Gianni’s team was 4 games better and he didn’t play next to another top 5 player in AD. Giannis raw stats were much better also. 29.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.6/1/1 and he was DPOY that year so defense wasn’t even close. James was 25.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.5.

</blockquote>

<p>Some years you can get 3-7 in DPOY and MVP voting but still only get 1 vote, it happens quite a lot. It&rsquo;s often between just 2 players, then someone can get 3rd with just 1 or 2 votes. That wasn&rsquo;t really the case in 2019 for PG13 though, he actually got some votes. 365 points in MVP(Giannis won with 941) and 150 in DPOY(Rudy won with 411).</p>

<p>So I think saying he was robbed is pretty much bullshit. He was also 1st All-Defense, KD wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>2016 Kawhi: Led the Spurs in scoring on 62% TS taking them to an insane 67 win record, the 7th best of all time. All while winning the DPOY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kawhi&rsquo;s supporting cast was insanely good that year. They went 8-2 without him that season (Thunder went 3-7 without KD). Also in 2018 when Kawhi skipped the season, the spurs had the third best defense in the league and made the playoffs. And that was with a much older Pau, Ginobili, and Parker and David West and Tim Duncan retired or gone.</p>

<p>Kawhi was really good that year but KD was better.</p>

I can&rsquo;t find how to look up what games he did miss, anyone know where to see that without digging through the whole season? Logically I would assume he&rsquo;s not load managing against the best teams, quite the contrary, he&rsquo;s probably resting against opponents they&rsquo;d expect to win against or at the end of the season when their standing is already set.</p>

<p>Kd was just way better. That’s why kd smoked him in the playoffs that year.</p>

<p>2016 yes- Kawhi won is over KD and I think KD should&rsquo;ve won it since Spurs is good without Kawhi on that year and stat wise KD is way better than Kawhi, 2019 though there is no conversation, Giannis is the MVP and PG had better stats and 3rd in MVP voting,</p>

      <label for="ll63uxp" class="commentText"><p>I disagree - I feel they are similar differences. Kahwi&rsquo;s defense was at such a high level that he&rsquo;s seen as one of the best wing defenders of all time (if not the best). His usage and offense were much lower than KD, but he did still shoot over 50% FG and 44% from 3. All NBA voting isn&rsquo;t everything, but Kawhi had 94 first team votes and 35 second team votes, while KD was essentially the inverse - 36 first team, 90 2nd team, 2 third team votes.</p>

<p>Westbrook also got more MVP votes than KD (4th and 5th in voting, respectively) that year.</p>

Even during the 2019 Regular Season &amp; Post-Season (KD made it to the finals btw and on his way to another Finals MVP) Paul George was not a better basketball player than Kevin Durant.</p>

PG a better defender and put up better numbers offensively than KD that year. That does not mean KD is worse than PG, just for that year PG played like a top 3 player in the league</p>

      <label for="ll5gx5r" class="commentText"><p>I am an avid basketball watcher. Ball-knower. Those accolades don’t mean squat in the context of “who’s better” imo. I’ll give you the All-Defensive 1st Team. Regarding All-NBA though , KD didn’t receive a SINGLE vote to be on the 3rd team. It was an all around consensus for him to be either 1st or 2nd. I assume there were doubts about putting him on 1st team due to Steph being a  Top 5 MVP candidate and making 1st team as well. The point I’m getting to is. These media-voted accolades do not hold much weight when it comes to “who’s better”. You can watch basketball with a clear mind and come away believing Kevin Durant is a better basketball player than Paul George <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. Depends on what you value I guess that determines that <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance.</p>

Compare Tatum to LeBron, Giannis, Kawhi in the years they got first team all-nba and he looks very average. He shot like 42% for the playoffs and cruised to a championship</p>

      <label for="ll5rbk5" class="commentText"><p>Genuine question.</p>

<p>In the nine playoff games between the Celtics and nets in 2021 and 2022, Tatum had more points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and wins than KD. And obviously he’s gotten better since then.</p>

<p>So what more does he have to do to be considered “as good as the competition” for people who don’t watch games like you?</p>
