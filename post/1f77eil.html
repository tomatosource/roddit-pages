<p>Kawhi&rsquo;s supporting cast was insanely good that year. They went 8-2 without him that season (Thunder went 3-7 without KD). Also in 2018 when Kawhi skipped the season, the spurs had the third best defense in the league and made the playoffs. And that was with a much older Pau, Ginobili, and Parker and David West and Tim Duncan retired or gone.</p>

<p>Kawhi was really good that year but KD was better.</p>

<p>If KD got punished for OKC finishing 3rd in 2016, idk how you justify PG being first team when OKC was 6th that season while KD and the Warriors were the number 1 seed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Some years you can get 3-7 in DPOY and MVP voting but still only get 1 vote, it happens quite a lot. It&rsquo;s often between just 2 players, then someone can get 3rd with just 1 or 2 votes. That wasn&rsquo;t really the case in 2019 for PG13 though, he actually got some votes. 365 points in MVP(Giannis won with 941) and 150 in DPOY(Rudy won with 411).</p>

<p>So I think saying he was robbed is pretty much bullshit.</p>

Compare Tatum to LeBron, Giannis, Kawhi in the years they got first team all-nba and he looks very average. He shot like 42% for the playoffs and cruised to a championship</p>

What I notice is that past the first round, Tatum’s scoring efficiency drops and becomes very hit or miss. Best example being his recent series vs Philly. He shot horribly for most of the series and then got hot at end of game 6 and game 7 and then his jumper disappeared again vs Miami. Not exactly what you’d call first team all-nba caliber</p>

He’s quite literally suffering from success by propping up guys like Hauser and Pritchard and validating your argument.

      <label for="ll5g7cm" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi 2016 was well deserved. He finished 2nd in MVP voting and won DPOY. Spurs were also neck and neck with the Warriors record setting team.</p>

<p>The real tragedy is that this is before the recent change for 3 front court players versus a required center in all NBA voting.  Otherwise, KD would be in over DeAndre Jordan.</p>
