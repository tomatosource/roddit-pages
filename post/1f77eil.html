      <label for="ll6rk9g" class="commentText"><p>did leaving even hurt his legacy? he could have stayed and probably won more, but people already discount his titles there and I don&rsquo;t think winning another 1 or 2 rings as part of the Warriors would have changed the perception of him a lot.</p>

<p>If anything I think it made it better, he was the only one on that team who consistently showed up and despite playing with Kyrie at his most mentally unstable and an injured Harden he was basically an inch away from almost knocking out the eventual champions and dropped 48 in a game 7.</p>

<p>I feel like him leaving perfectly summed up his legacy, he&rsquo;s a baller through and through, and despite what the team situation is he&rsquo;s going to show up and play at a high level regardless of what&rsquo;s going on off the court. he&rsquo;s just a guy who likes basketball and is really good at it.</p>

<p>2016
Kawhi:
Led the Spurs in scoring on 62% TS taking them to an insane 67 win record, the 7th best of all time. All while winning the DPOY. </p>

<p>LeBron was still prime LeBron and led the Cavs to the top spot in the East.</p>

<p>2019
Paul George was the 2nd leading scorer in the league above KD. He was also 3rd in DPOY and MVP voting that year. OKC outperformed that year. </p>

<p>Giannis was MVP</p>

      <label for="ll5l1w4" class="commentText"><p>It’s not that dissimilar to LeBron, really. He has a lot more First Teams than KD but in a 20+ year career as the potential actual GOAT, he “only” has four MVPs, 1 fewer than MJ who had effectively half the career length.</p>

<p>But if you actually go down year-by-year you can see why. Was LeBron the objective best player in the entire league for a whole hell of a lot more than 4 seasons? Yep, but because these are seasonal awards with their own specific conditions, these things just happen.</p>

<p>Kobe and Duncan were the best players of the 2000s and won 3 MVPs combined.</p>

<p>Giannis has been in the argument for best player in the league since 2019 but has only gotten the 2.</p>

<p>Right now it seems like Jokic could win MVP every year but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we just saw his last or he only gets one more. Luka, Shai and others are knocking on the door</p>

I think 18’ is a stretch but I would have given him the mvp in 20’. 60 something win pace in a significantly harder conference. Giannis advanced metrics were through the roof but his minutes being slightly down fucked with a lot of them because they look through a per/36 minute pace regardless of possessions.</p>

<p>2018, Harden team won 67 games and finished 1 overall. James team won 50 and finished 4th in the East.</p>

<p>2006: nah if anyone got robbed it’s Kobe.</p>

<p>2020: Gianni’s team was 4 games better and he didn’t play next to another top 5 player in AD. Giannis raw stats were much better also. 29.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.6/1/1 and he was DPOY that year so defense wasn’t even close. James was 25.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.5. You can argue he wasn’t even as valuable as AD since AD lead the team in PPG, Rebounds, Stealss, Blocks, OWS, DWS, TWS</p>

<p>LeBron was still prime LeBron and led the Cavs to the top spot in the East.</p>

<p>2019 Paul George was the 2nd leading scorer in the league above KD. He was also 3rd in DPOY and MVP voting that year. OKC outperformed that year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some years you can get 3-7 in DPOY and MVP voting but still only get 1 vote, it happens quite a lot. It&rsquo;s often between just 2 players, then someone can get 3rd with just 1 or 2 votes. That wasn&rsquo;t really the case in 2019 for PG13 though, he actually got some votes. 365 points in MVP(Giannis won with 941) and 150 in DPOY(Rudy won with 411).</p>

<p>So I think saying he was robbed is pretty much bullshit. He was also 1st All-Defense, KD wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Kawhi&rsquo;s supporting cast was insanely good that year. They went 8-2 without him that season (Thunder went 3-7 without KD). Also in 2018 when Kawhi skipped the season, the spurs had the third best defense in the league and made the playoffs. And that was with a much older Pau, Ginobili, and Parker and David West and Tim Duncan retired or gone.</p>

<p>Kawhi was really good that year but KD was better.</p>

Logically I would assume he&rsquo;s not load managing against the best teams, quite the contrary, he&rsquo;s probably resting against opponents they&rsquo;d expect to win against or at the end of the season when their standing is already set.</p>

<p>2016 yes- Kawhi won is over KD and I think KD should&rsquo;ve won it since Spurs is good without Kawhi on that year and stat wise KD is way better than Kawhi, 2019 though there is no conversation, Giannis is the MVP and PG had better stats and 3rd in MVP voting,</p>

      <label for="ll63uxp" class="commentText"><p>I disagree - I feel they are similar differences. Kahwi&rsquo;s defense was at such a high level that he&rsquo;s seen as one of the best wing defenders of all time (if not the best). His usage and offense were much lower than KD, but he did still shoot over 50% FG and 44% from 3. All NBA voting isn&rsquo;t everything, but Kawhi had 94 first team votes and 35 second team votes, while KD was essentially the inverse - 36 first team, 90 2nd team, 2 third team votes.</p>

<p>Westbrook also got more MVP votes than KD (4th and 5th in voting, respectively) that year.</p>

      <label for="ll5gx5r" class="commentText"><p>I am an avid basketball watcher. Ball-knower. Those accolades don’t mean squat in the context of “who’s better” imo. I’ll give you the All-Defensive 1st Team. Regarding All-NBA though , KD didn’t receive a SINGLE vote to be on the 3rd team. It was an all around consensus for him to be either 1st or 2nd. I assume there were doubts about putting him on 1st team due to Steph being a  Top 5 MVP candidate and making 1st team as well. The point I’m getting to is. These media-voted accolades do not hold much weight when it comes to “who’s better”. You can watch basketball with a clear mind and come away believing Kevin Durant is a better basketball player than Paul George <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. Depends on what you value I guess that determines that <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance.</p>

<p>Greatly discredit his defense, better defender than at least 3 of the guys you named. His awareness of making the right plays on both sides, doesn’t turn possessions bad by forcing low % shots or ignoring better looks is something I can’t say about Luka and Shai to a degree.

<p>Both Luka are Shai are way more efficient than Tatum and better playmakers. Shai specifically doesn’t even turn the ball over.</p>

<p>It’s not just a slump lmao, he’s NEVER been as efficient as they are right now. He’s a great defender, but he’s not a dpoy or top 10 level defender in the NBA.</p>

<p>Out of that entire list, he’s pretty easily the worst scorer and worst playmaker while being the third best defender.</p>

<p>For their careers, Luka’s TS% is 58.8%, Tatum’s is 58.3%</p>

<p>If you wanna just go last 3 years, Luka is at 60% and Tatum is at 59.6%</p>

<p>Last season Luka made the gap slightly bigger. It was 61.7% to 60.4%. On Tatum’s volume, that means if he scored 43 more points last season, he’d have a 61.7% TS. If Tatum was at 27.5ppg instead of 26.9ppg, would your opinion of him be any different?</p>

<p>I don’t really care if you think Tatum is worse than Luka. But to act like there is some massive gap because of efficiency is just flat out lying</p>

      <label for="ll6392e" class="commentText"><p>So many people trying to discredit 2023-2024 Tatum (because 27/8/5 on 60.4 TS% is bad apparently), but the year before he put up 30/9/5 on 60.7 TS%. He also plays defense. He came in 6th, 4th and 6th in MVP voting the last 3 years. You can argue there&rsquo;s no way Brunsen had a better year than him this year (came in 5th for MVP voting) especially when you count both sides of the ball.</p>

<p>Yeah, our team was stacked this year, Tatum didn&rsquo;t have to do nearly as much the entire season and post season and it&rsquo;s why we had such an easy playoff run.</p>

<p>And I’m I’m not propping up Pritchard and Hauser lol I’m stating objectively how good they were with Tatum off the court which is a MASSIVE reason they were one of the best teams ever</p>

      <label for="ll5ipxn" class="commentText"><p>Stats without context are meaningless. Look at who the Celtics faced in the playoffs this year. Heat without Butler, Cavs without Mitchell for half the series, Pacers without Hali for half the series. Even if all these teams were healthy, no one thinks they are contenders. And finally, Mavs in the finals. Giving respect to them for reaching there, but that was due to matchups.</p>

      <label for="ll5kbr3" class="commentText"><p>The 1987 Lakers beat 3 teams that were a net 8 games under .500 en route to the finals and are widely agreed upon as a top 5 team in NBA history. I just don’t get how you can see an 82 game sample size plus playoff series beforehand plus the series actually going on in which Boston was up both times and come to the conclusion that if Donovan Mitchell and or Tyrese Haliburton played every game they’d beat Boston.</p>

<p>It’s bc they beat the defending champions 1987 Celtics that have the same team as the 1986 Celtics that were recognized as one of the best teams ever. Cmon you know this as a Celtics fan.</p>

      <label for="ll5n6d1" class="commentText"><p>I still challenge you to give me a single rational argument. If you’re going to say they’re inflated cause of the east then you’re saying that half the teams in the league are exempt from ever being as good as the other half which is the dumbest logic I’ve ever heard.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you wanna go off statistics, the Celtics still went 23-7 against the west, good enough for a 77% win rate or a 62-20 full season record which would’ve still easily been the best in the league.</p>

<p>Third you sound like a you just pointed out that the east is worse meaning the Lakers finals win should be diminished by the fact that their best win is against an eastern conference team shouldn’t it? Or are you just moving the goal posts for this years Celtics team cause you don’t like Jayson Tatum?</p>

      <label for="ll5d10m" class="commentText"><p>His durability is what props up his standing so much because he never gets hurt which is a good thing for a long season but he looked just ok in the playoffs with his jumper being so broke which seems to happen often for him. Compare Tatum to LeBron, Giannis, Kawhi in the years they got first team all-nba and he looks very average. He shot like 42% for the playoffs and cruised to a championship</p>

      <label for="ll5rbk5" class="commentText"><p>Genuine question.</p>

<p>In the nine playoff games between the Celtics and nets in 2021 and 2022, Tatum had more points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and wins than KD. And obviously he’s gotten better since then.</p>

<p>So what more does he have to do to be considered “as good as the competition” for people who don’t watch games like you?</p>
