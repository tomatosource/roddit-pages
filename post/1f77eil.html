<p>2016
Kawhi:
Led the Spurs in scoring on 62% TS taking them to an insane 67 win record, the 7th best of all time. All while winning the DPOY. </p>

<p>LeBron was still prime LeBron and led the Cavs to the top spot in the East.</p>

<p>2019
Paul George was the 2nd leading scorer in the league above KD. He was also 3rd in DPOY and MVP voting that year. OKC outperformed that year. </p>

<p>Giannis was MVP</p>

<p>But if you actually go down year-by-year you can see why. Was LeBron the objective best player in the entire league for a whole hell of a lot more than 4 seasons? Yep, but because these are seasonal awards with their own specific conditions, these things just happen.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Some years you can get 3-7 in DPOY and MVP voting but still only get 1 vote, it happens quite a lot. It&rsquo;s often between just 2 players, then someone can get 3rd with just 1 or 2 votes. That wasn&rsquo;t really the case in 2019 for PG13 though, he actually got some votes. 365 points in MVP(Giannis won with 941) and 150 in DPOY(Rudy won with 411).</p>

<p>So I think saying he was robbed is pretty much bullshit. He was also 1st All-Defense, KD wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Kawhi&rsquo;s supporting cast was insanely good that year. They went 8-2 without him that season (Thunder went 3-7 without KD). Also in 2018 when Kawhi skipped the season, the spurs had the third best defense in the league and made the playoffs. And that was with a much older Pau, Ginobili, and Parker and David West and Tim Duncan retired or gone.</p>

<p>Kawhi was really good that year but KD was better.</p>

<p>KD clearly had a better individual year. Sure if you count team success than you can’t have PG first team when his team had the 6seed in 2019.</p>

<p>2016 yes- Kawhi won is over KD and I think KD should&rsquo;ve won it since Spurs is good without Kawhi on that year and stat wise KD is way better than Kawhi, 2019 though there is no conversation, Giannis is the MVP and PG had better stats and 3rd in MVP voting,</p>

Jason Kidd has the same amount of All NBAs and all star appearances during that span (but no ring). Maybe Erving? But he only spent 3 seasons with the nets. Brook Lopez? Lol</p>

<p>Tatum isn’t on the level of KD, Lebron, Giannis, but he’s arguably better than anybody that played for the nets longer than 3 seasons</p>

<p>You would have probably liked him more if Billy King didn’t trade the rights to JT or if he didn’t beat the KD led Nets right before they broke up</p>

<p>Advanced stats will choose KD every day of the week, but context has a huge impact on advanced stats.</p>

<p>KD took about 5 shots more per game during their first 7 years. Tatum shoots slightly more efficiently, but gets to the line much less. Tatum creates for others a little better, Durant creates for himself a little better.</p>

<p>Both guys were drafted into incredible situations.  Tatum was able to convert that into a championship. Durant was able to convert that into an MVP and a partnership with Steph Curry.  I think probably KD had better teammates for his first 7 years, and Tatum probably better coaching.</p>

<p>I think the gap between the 2 when all is said and done is much closer than current popular thought.</p>

Even during the 2019 Regular Season &amp; Post-Season (KD made it to the finals btw and on his way to another Finals MVP) Paul George was not a better basketball player than Kevin Durant.</p>

      <label for="ll5gx5r" class="commentText"><p>I am an avid basketball watcher. Ball-knower. Those accolades don’t mean squat in the context of “who’s better” imo. I’ll give you the All-Defensive 1st Team. Regarding All-NBA though , KD didn’t receive a SINGLE vote to be on the 3rd team. It was an all around consensus for him to be either 1st or 2nd. I assume there were doubts about putting him on 1st team due to Steph being a  Top 5 MVP candidate and making 1st team as well. The point I’m getting to is. These media-voted accolades do not hold much weight when it comes to “who’s better”. You can watch basketball with a clear mind and come away believing Kevin Durant is a better basketball player than Paul George <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. Depends on what you value I guess that determines that <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> chance.</p>

      <label for="ll5fbzw" class="commentText"><p>Tatum faced the nets in the first round both years and his jumper was falling for him. What I notice is that past the first round, Tatum’s scoring efficiency drops and becomes very hit or miss. Best example being his recent series vs Philly. He shot horribly for most of the series and then got hot at end of game 6 and game 7 and then his jumper disappeared again vs Miami. Not exactly what you’d call first team all-nba caliber</p>

<p>Greatly discredit his defense, better defender than at least 3 of the guys you named. His awareness of making the right plays on both sides, doesn’t turn possessions bad by forcing low % shots or ignoring better looks is something I can’t say about Luka and Shai to a degree. A shooting slump doesn’t mean he isn’t in the same tier as these guys</p>

      <label for="ll5l3d1" class="commentText"><p>They play in the East. Cmon man, you know that means more of their games are skewed towards weaker competition.</p>

<p>It’s bc they beat the defending champions 1987 Celtics that have the same team as the 1986 Celtics that were recognized as one of the best teams ever. Cmon you know this as a Celtics fan.</p>

      <label for="ll5n6d1" class="commentText"><p>I still challenge you to give me a single rational argument. If you’re going to say they’re inflated cause of the east then you’re saying that half the teams in the league are exempt from ever being as good as the other half which is the dumbest logic I’ve ever heard.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you wanna go off statistics, the Celtics still went 23-7 against the west, good enough for a 77% win rate or a 62-20 full season record which would’ve still easily been the best in the league.</p>

<p>Third you sound like a you just pointed out that the east is worse meaning the Lakers finals win should be diminished by the fact that their best win is against an eastern conference team shouldn’t it? Or are you just moving the goal posts for this years Celtics team cause you don’t like Jayson Tatum?</p>

      <label for="ll5d10m" class="commentText"><p>His durability is what props up his standing so much because he never gets hurt which is a good thing for a long season but he looked just ok in the playoffs with his jumper being so broke which seems to happen often for him. Compare Tatum to LeBron, Giannis, Kawhi in the years they got first team all-nba and he looks very average. He shot like 42% for the playoffs and cruised to a championship</p>

<p>They don’t care about the ring when Tatum played like ass to get it. Same thing with the gold medal</p>
