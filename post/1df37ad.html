      <label for="l8gkvbb" class="commentText"><p>As people said before they don’t play five out which really stresses the Mavs. Also, KAT was really bad on open threes. The one game he hit they won.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t think people are taking account of the emotional hangover after beating Denver. I think they really couldn’t get up for the first game.</p>

<p>Plus, they had some defensive scheme issues ironically.</p>

      <label for="l8gs7jd" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, this is a pretty accurate read from my vantage point.</p>

<p>I think Dallas was just a horrible matchup for Minnesota (or maybe better put, Minnesota was a fantastic matchup for Dallas). The Mavericks defense is built upon having Gafford and Lively camp in the lane to shut down the rim. The Wolves pretty much always had someone the Mavs could ignore beyond 6 feet, be it Gobert, SloMo, or even McDaniels. Similarly, McDaniels, while not terrible offensively, uses length to score rather than speed, which allowed Luka to not get blown by so easily defensively. Plus the Wolves aren’t really a team to relentlessly attack a weak link. The Mavs also have only one real defensive stopper on the wing (DJJ) and the Wolves only really have one perimeter creator, which allowed Dallas to hold up in a way they aren’t against a team like Boston who has multiple legit perimeter creators.</p>

<p>On top of that, I think Minnesota was poorly situated to guard Dallas’ offense. They, unlike Boston or OKC, don’t really have the personnel to switch everything (Conley is too small, Rudy is a little too slow), which allowed Luka to always get the defender on his back which allowed him to dictate the pick and roll. I kind of wished the Wolves did a bit more of what Boston did with Porzingis (leaving Rudy to roam off of a weaker shooter and switching more in front), but it’s not necessarily a guarantee to work for the Wolves.</p>

<p>I also think shooting variance played a pretty big role in the series. Like you mentioned KAT was ice cold from deep all series long. When the Mavericks entire game plan revolves around clogging up the paint, that is a death sentence. But Dallas also had some positive shooting variance — Luka shot 43.4% against the Wolves on very difficult attempts, but is shooting only 32.1% against Boston. Kyrie shot 38% from deep against the Wolves and only 29% from deep against the Celtics (while also making pretty much all of his bullshit left handed scoop shots in that Wolves series). DJJ who is getting played off the floor because of his shooting against Boston, shot 46.6% from deep against the Wolves. On the whole, Dallas is shooting significantly worse on 3s versus Boston than Minnesota, although some of that is definitely a byproduct of good Celtics defense.</p>

<p>I’ll also just add, I think the schedule hurt Minnesota a lot. They got one fewer day of rest than Dallas and had to travel back from Denver. Like you said, they were exhausted (physically and mentally) from that Denver series and never really seemed to catch their rhythm at all. They came out flat in game 1 and 2 and bungled two winnable games. At that point, Dallas was in command and the every-other-day schedule meant Minnesota never had time to really reset or adjust. I also think Ant was at least somewhat hurt after that scary fall in game 6 — he looked off offensively for 3 straight games following that tumble, and slowly started to regain burst as the series wore on. All in all, it really hurt Minnesota’s ability to get their legs and create a real counter to Dallas’s play style (something Boston has had ample time to prepare for, which you can see in their execution).</p>

<li><p>MIN doesn&rsquo;t have a great secondary ball handler/creator</p></li>

<li><p>Finch doesn&rsquo;t believe in matchup hunting or structure. His &ldquo;flow&rdquo; offense is all about moving the ball around quickly, driving, and making quick decisions until something opens up (which is kind of counter to KAT and Ant&rsquo;s games who both kind of like to hold the ball). His break-glass-in-case-of-emergency guy when things are stagnant is Jordan McLaughlin who plays fast, moves the ball, and generally brings a lot of energy.</p></li>

Everyone else the Mavs have played had former Superstars or current Superstars, and almost all of them were elite finishers and drivers at some point/currently.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, Ant isn&rsquo;t as good a passer as SGA, Harden, or Tatum, while getting that level of attention.</p>

He was 42% from 3 in the regular season, 44% from 3 in the first two rounds, and just hit a slump at the wrong time. 2-9, 1-5, 0-8, and 1-6 in the games they lost. Mavs played well on him on defense but he couldn’t hit even wide open ones. Happens.</p>

      <label for="l8ge4vt" class="commentText"><p>Pointing at a player on the perimeter, telling his teammate to get out there because he&rsquo;s too lazy to do it himself, is another signature Luka move. It&rsquo;s like he thinks a wide open basket made against him is worth fewer points as long as he demonstrates that he saw it before it happened.</p>

<p>Their fans start spewing how they’re actually good defenders in matchups where they can hide on defense and do fuck all except deflect some passes and get a stop once in a blue moon.</p>

<p>The second you get a series where you can’t hide them it’s beyond atrocious. Might as well put a fork in the series. </p>

      <label for="l8gwkm3" class="commentText"><p>Steph has also ALWAYS had weapons around him on offense who can take some of the load off. Mavs offense right now is literally just Kyrie and Luka trying to go 1:1 with minimal movement around them. Role players are expected to either clean up the misses or play catch &amp; shoot when they get open looks off a defensive collapse. It&rsquo;s a fine way to beat a middling team in the regular season but it&rsquo;s impossible to do that against an elite team like Boston across a 7 game series.</p>

<p>Obviously still not a great defender but he was playing his part and had a high motor on defense in those 2022 Finals.</p>

<p>Sidenote. This is why I still love Aaron Nesmith. I think he’s going to develop really well. He’s young and really rash with fouls/physicality but he has an incredibly high motor and was hounding Tatum play after play this year.</p>

      <label for="l8gj47z" class="commentText"><p>It’s also on ball defense vs team defense</p>

<p>Steph is a weak link in terms of how many guys see him as a good matchup one on one.</p>

<p>But Steph understands the team’s defensive schemes and rarely just gives up after a blow by or has no idea where he’s supposed to be on the floor.</p>

<p>Good team defense makes it easier to build a system that covers for the player’s weaknesses on ball. But even good on ball defenders will fuck over their team’s defense if they don’t know what to do off ball.</p>

So when Luka gets blown by it would at least not be free baskets, daring teams to beat them making kick out 3s. Forcing any difficult 2 would be a win.</p>

<p>This defense doesn&rsquo;t work against the Celtics cause they can play 5 out with multiple playmakers. OKC played a similar style offense but with only one playmaker and Shai is more willingly to jack up ill advised shots (and make them) than pass.</p>

<p>This was inevitable for the Mavs and I said weeks ago the only way they were gonna make this a series is if they could drill a shit ton of good 3s.</p>

      <label for="l8gw11y" class="commentText"><p>Also all of our players have slow releases and aren’t comfortable shooting semi contested, meanwhile if you give Jrue, JB, White, Tatum, even down to Hauser and so on an inch of space, they’ll take the three. The difference between what KP thinks is open and what Chet thinks is open is staggering.</p>

<p>That’s why the Mavs gapping on drives bothered our non Shai players so much, but didn’t do a thing the Celtics.</p>

      <label for="l8gwadz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this defensive game plan is always going to be bad against big guards and wings who can finish at the rim, pass and hit 3’s. You see the Celtics do this multiple times in a possession. Blow by Luka, draw in second defender kick to the shooter, force help defender to fly out on the shot, drive past a closing defender and repeat. Not only does it get open shots, but with the defense in scramble mode for 10-15 seconds every possession…that’s exhausting for the Mavs.</p>

      <label for="l8gvvbd" class="commentText"><p>Because blowing by your primary defender doesn&rsquo;t help much when you have Gafford or Lively then meeting you at the rim.  The TWolves can&rsquo;t effectively pull those dudes out of the paint with Gobert on the floor, and were bad with Gobert off the floor. Even though Naz lets them play more of a 5 out the Mavs could do whatever they wanted in the paint offensively when he was on the floor.</p>

<p>Jokes aside it has been known all of Luka&rsquo;s career that he sucks on defense. I said this when he was drafted that yes he could score in the NBA, but the question will be can he play defense.</p>

<p>And so just like Dirk the Mavs will need to make sure they have elite defenders all over the court to cover for Luka defensively.</p>

There are at least five different reasons why they are losing and it doesn&rsquo;t involve luka defense. Dallas was a plus 9 when Luka was on the court in this game. For all the talk about &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; Dallas still played better and won the minutes that Luka was on the court. And throughout this series Dallas has played better despite the quote on quote &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; when Luka is on the court. Is he being targeted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but is that the reason why they are losing no!</p>

<p>When I say laughing at, I mean I am praying for Tatum to have the ball 100% of the time because he is not good enough. When he shoots or dribbles or drives, I relax. Derrick White scares me more than Tatum.</p>

<p>FYI, when you have a really good team aka the Celtics (which their top 7, including Tatum, are really good), game gets easier for stars. The fact people are praising him for this series is wild.</p>

You can admit that your superstar is not actually a superstar and is more like a top 20 player in the league and that your team is insanely well built and has good chemistry and coaching.</p>

<p>The only reason you&rsquo;re praising Tatum&rsquo;s play is because he&rsquo;s winning, which he&rsquo;s winning because of the other players on his team, namely Jaylen Brown. The 5 out offense that the Celtics have should result in Tatum having insane efficiency but he looks like dogshit.</p>

      <label for="l8gl1rp" class="commentText"><p>The fact that the top 3 is Luka from this postseason could be evidence that he is limited by injuries/conditioning. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that Luka is laboring as well as heavier than he&rsquo;s ever been. It would be helpful if it included his previous playoff years.   </p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s also possible that Luka just got worst on defense too.</p>

      <label for="l8g4nu8" class="commentText"><p>Luka is occasionally capable and/or willing to defend at a pretty decent level, but no one that ball dominant on offense will ever be a consistent lockdown defender. He also gets caught ball watching and doesn’t box out.</p>

<p>However, the reason why he ranks so high this playoffs (as opposed to his other playoff series) in this blow by stat is because he is clearly not 100% healthy. There’s a reason he’s been questionable pretty much every game. Watch a healthy Luka game from this season and you’ll see a different player.</p>

<p>PSA: I’m not saying he’s a good defender. I’m saying his injury is a primary reason he is grading as the WORST playoff defender of all time</p>

Didn’t seem to be a huge issue because he - and all of his teammates - made every single shot they took against Minnesota , and the wolves got stuffed at the rim by gafford and lively so the “blow-by” wasn’t really a thing.</p>

<p>It’s honestly absurd we made it this far with his injury.</p>

<p>His percentages on offense and defense especially (lateral movements) are worse than regular season.</p>
