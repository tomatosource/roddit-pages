      <label for="l8gkvbb" class="commentText"><p>As people said before they don’t play five out which really stresses the Mavs. Also, KAT was really bad on open threes. The one game he hit they won.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t think people are taking account of the emotional hangover after beating Denver. I think they really couldn’t get up for the first game.</p>

<p>Plus, they had some defensive scheme issues ironically.</p>

      <label for="l8gs7jd" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, this is a pretty accurate read from my vantage point.</p>

<p>I think Dallas was just a horrible matchup for Minnesota (or maybe better put, Minnesota was a fantastic matchup for Dallas). The Mavericks defense is built upon having Gafford and Lively camp in the lane to shut down the rim. The Wolves pretty much always had someone the Mavs could ignore beyond 6 feet, be it Gobert, SloMo, or even McDaniels. Similarly, McDaniels, while not terrible offensively, uses length to score rather than speed, which allowed Luka to not get blown by so easily defensively. Plus the Wolves aren’t really a team to relentlessly attack a weak link. The Mavs also have only one real defensive stopper on the wing (DJJ) and the Wolves only really have one perimeter creator, which allowed Dallas to hold up in a way they aren’t against a team like Boston who has multiple legit perimeter creators.</p>

<p>On top of that, I think Minnesota was poorly situated to guard Dallas’ offense. They, unlike Boston or OKC, don’t really have the personnel to switch everything (Conley is too small, Rudy is a little too slow), which allowed Luka to always get the defender on his back which allowed him to dictate the pick and roll. I kind of wished the Wolves did a bit more of what Boston did with Porzingis (leaving Rudy to roam off of a weaker shooter and switching more in front), but it’s not necessarily a guarantee to work for the Wolves.</p>

<p>I also think shooting variance played a pretty big role in the series. Like you mentioned KAT was ice cold from deep all series long. When the Mavericks entire game plan revolves around clogging up the paint, that is a death sentence. But Dallas also had some positive shooting variance — Luka shot 43.4% against the Wolves on very difficult attempts, but is shooting only 32.1% against Boston. Kyrie shot 38% from deep against the Wolves and only 29% from deep against the Celtics (while also making pretty much all of his bullshit left handed scoop shots in that Wolves series). DJJ who is getting played off the floor because of his shooting against Boston, shot 46.6% from deep against the Wolves. On the whole, Dallas is shooting significantly worse on 3s versus Boston than Minnesota, although some of that is definitely a byproduct of good Celtics defense.</p>

<p>I’ll also just add, I think the schedule hurt Minnesota a lot. They got one fewer day of rest than Dallas and had to travel back from Denver. Like you said, they were exhausted (physically and mentally) from that Denver series and never really seemed to catch their rhythm at all. They came out flat in game 1 and 2 and bungled two winnable games. At that point, Dallas was in command and the every-other-day schedule meant Minnesota never had time to really reset or adjust. I also think Ant was at least somewhat hurt after that scary fall in game 6 — he looked off offensively for 3 straight games following that tumble, and slowly started to regain burst as the series wore on. All in all, it really hurt Minnesota’s ability to get their legs and create a real counter to Dallas’s play style (something Boston has had ample time to prepare for, which you can see in their execution).</p>

      <label for="l8h414s" class="commentText"><p>OKC&rsquo;s role players are all young and inexperienced guys tbh. There&rsquo;s a reason young teams don&rsquo;t win. PJ and DJJ were hot for sure, but also you have to consider that the Thunder&rsquo;s scheme was basically just conceding open 3&rsquo;s to them to take away Luka and Kyrie&rsquo;s stuff.</p>

<p>Boston is doing it differently. They are helping off of them above the break, but never enough that they can&rsquo;t run them off the 3pt line. They&rsquo;re content with switching everything when Porzingis is off the floor and giving up isolations to Luka and Kyrie to take them out of their pick and roll game and take away the lob threat. When they do make the kickout pass, most of the time the shooter is run off the line and forced to attack a closeout which they&rsquo;ve been terrible at. Tatum&rsquo;s ability to guard the Center, get bords and keep Horford/KP roaming has also been huge.</p>

<p>Also you guys held Dallas to a 113.4 offensive rating. Ironically, you guys <em>also</em> finished with a 113.4 offensive rating in the series, scoring the <em>EXACT</em> same amount of points, but your issue was that you couldn&rsquo;t get your offense working until it was too late. Giddey&rsquo;s minutes were slashed but he was completely ineffective in them and allowed the bigs to roam. The big problem was that you needed Dort out there for defense but he provided someone else that the Mavs felt comfortable enough helping off of.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there are zero players in the Celtics normal rotation that can be comfortably helped off of. All of their players except Porzingis, Al and Hauser are comfortable spotting up AND attacking closeouts. Although Al definitely can if he has space. Hauser is one of the best shooters in the league and KP and Al are two of the best floor spacing bigs in the game so they&rsquo;re still providing lots of value.</p>

<p>Everyone else can shoot <em>and</em> attack so with the way the Mavs are constructed their choices are to concede kickout passes or give Tatum and Brown comfortable layups. They&rsquo;ve chosen the former. It&rsquo;s damned if you do damned if you don&rsquo;t really. We&rsquo;re just impossible to guard. You have to hope we miss lol.</p>

      <label for="l8h9auk" class="commentText"><p>Oh for sure, okc deserved to lose the game. A few big differences between okc and the Celtics are visible here -</p>

<ul>
<li>I think the big flaw of the okc scheme that is not the case with the Celtics is the corner 3s. Okc gave up a ton of them and was slower to closeout</li>
<li>this is related to the fact that okc&rsquo;s defenders, while excellent, were smaller. Tatum being able to disrupt lobs and get boards is something okc struggled to do. Really I wanted more JWill+Chet lineups but Mark was uncomfortable with it.</li>
<li>obviously related is that Chet is still growing into his body and was clearly gassed by the second half of the season. He hasn&rsquo;t reached the point where he can play 82 and then go deep in the playoffs, his body couldn&rsquo;t make it. He&rsquo;s also not mastered rebounding to the degree someone like KP has, nor the quick shooting release - he can get there but he&rsquo;s not there yet.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure if helping off of Dort was the problem. He shot reasonably well iirc and was guarded more honestly. It was more that everyone else didn&rsquo;t step up. Giddey even in his limited minutes was no surprise, but I didn&rsquo;t expect to see Joe or Dub be quite so off. Aaron Wiggins was the only bright spot of attacking the rim, which is uncharacteristic of the team. Cason wallace played good d but was clearly overwhelmed offensively.</li>
<li>However the strategy of locking up Kyrie and Luka wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad one. I give a lot of credit to both jdub and Dort for making them shoot far below their averages. If you recall, they won game 6 on DJJ and PJ hitting some absolutely unreasonable shots in late clock situations. That&rsquo;s just how playoff basketball goes sometimes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially my point is that okc was poised in theory to do a lot of the same, albeit with one weak link in giddey (who played limited minutes anyways) and the bigger issue of just not being as big. Getting a solid wing 6&rdquo;8&rsquo;+ wing who can defend and rebound well and do at least a bit of everything else to replace giddey would catapult the team to the next level. I think a dude like markannen, despite his massive defensive limitations, would allow for the team to really step up, but I would be very happy if they get Kuz for example (though I&rsquo;m lower on Deni as I don&rsquo;t trust his offense). Snatching up KCP wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea either.</p>

<p>See this attitude everywhere with homers. In elections (Trump supporters in 2020), see it in basketball all the time, etc. Just learn how to take a loss graciously, and it&rsquo;s a 7 game series ffs. It&rsquo;s not even like football (soccer) or American tackleball (football) or NCAA college basketball where it&rsquo;s winner take all. So there&rsquo;s even less of a reason to complain.</p>

<li><p>MIN doesn&rsquo;t have a great secondary ball handler/creator</p></li>

<li><p>Finch doesn&rsquo;t believe in matchup hunting or structure. His &ldquo;flow&rdquo; offense is all about moving the ball around quickly, driving, and making quick decisions until something opens up (which is kind of counter to KAT and Ant&rsquo;s games who both kind of like to hold the ball). His break-glass-in-case-of-emergency guy when things are stagnant is Jordan McLaughlin who plays fast, moves the ball, and generally brings a lot of energy.</p></li>

<p>oh and before someone replys the excuse. luka got hurt end of game 3&hellip;. and if i remember people were saying luka defense got so much better from adjusting off first 2 games. dude was guarding kawhi who was actually injured and honestly the reason they lost 2 games being a liability</p>

<p>wolves saying they did better then clippers with no kawhi shouldnt be something to applaud.  i mean even more so cause they sold and barley put up a fight this one stat means absolutely nothing it could of been pace or any other reason</p>

Everyone else the Mavs have played had former Superstars or current Superstars, and almost all of them were elite finishers and drivers at some point/currently.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, Ant isn&rsquo;t as good a passer as SGA, Harden, or Tatum, while getting that level of attention.</p>

      <label for="l8gxmff" class="commentText"><p>It’s fair to say KAT did not play particularly intelligently but by far the bigger issue was that his shot just wasn’t falling. He was 42% from 3 in the regular season, 44% from 3 in the first two rounds, and just hit a slump at the wrong time. 2-9, 1-5, 0-8, and 1-6 in the games they lost. Mavs played well on him on defense but he couldn’t hit even wide open ones. Happens.</p>

      <label for="l8h0na6" class="commentText"><p>Everyone gets beat off the dribble in the NBA. It&rsquo;s impossible to completely lock down the best guards and wings. But you have to put up some resistance. You can direct them towards the help. There are things that can be done to make the blow by less detrimental. Luka just gets beat immediately over and over again.</p>

<p>He does that reach from behind where 1 out of 10 times he may tip the ball away. The other 9 times, his man gets into the paint and collapses the entire defense or has a wide open layup/dunk.</p>

<p>Luka doesn&rsquo;t even try. Maybe his injuries are really limiting him. I don&rsquo;t completely buy that because he still can get to the basket on offense. He can still play physical on that end of the ball. On defense though, he isn&rsquo;t even giving the slightest effort.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m honestly really disappointed watching him. Steph Curry is my favorite player. Whatever you want to say about Curry&rsquo;s limitations on defense, he at least gives a shit. He tries to keep his man in front of him, and he makes the right rotations. I was so excited to watch Luka in the Finals because I thought he was this genius basketball player who was going to make life miserable for Boston. Instead I saw him make a bunch of really difficult two pointers, throw a few nice passes, and get absolutely abused on defense while whining and complaining to the refs every possession.</p>

<p>I root for greatness. I haven&rsquo;t seen it this series from Luka. It&rsquo;s just disappointing to me.</p>

      <label for="l8hji36" class="commentText"><p>Luka is obviously a great player. He got a limited Dallas team to the NBA finals and is averaging 30 a game. He carried the team the first two games when Irving was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Your points are valid and he hasn’t hit that next level of iconic finals performances we all want to see. But he’s definitely injured right now so let’s see if he can bounce back from this.</p>

<p>Curry wasn’t Curry for a long time and he definitely put up some playoff stinkers as well.</p>

<p>Luka doesn&rsquo;t even try. Maybe his injuries are really limiting him.</p>

<p>You can see it gets worse as the game goes on, so I&rsquo;m thinking he&rsquo;s gassed and is just mentally able to push when he needs to on offense where it yields - frankly amazing - results. On defense he&rsquo;s not as affective so pushing it is harder for him.</p>

The same could also be said about Kobe during his peak years in 08-10. Defense is like 80% effort.</p>

He&rsquo;s too fucking big and lumbering to keep up with some of these dudes, but he should be able to rotate and not fall asleep after the first blow by. Him not coming back on D after misses (while bitching to the refs or hanging his head) + not paying attention on second effort situations is what&rsquo;s been killing us.</p>

<p>That and the offensive dearth of the rest of the team, of course. For all his defensive woes he&rsquo;s a monster on offense and he&rsquo;s the only reason the Mavs are here at all. And fuck me if I ever have to see Hardaway and Green closing a finals game ever again.</p>

      <label for="l8ih65t" class="commentText"><p>I only watch basketball casually but aren&rsquo;t halfcourt mismatches created by &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; teams to switch on picks or switch on rotates?</p>

<p>My understanding is if Luka forces his help defense out and doesn&rsquo;t either rotate or double team the drive successfully then that&rsquo;s leaving a man open on the outside which could result in mismatch if Celtics don&rsquo;t swing the ball fast enough but that&rsquo;s just the worst case scenario for the Celtics. I don&rsquo;t watch rotations closely and I just follow the ball like a true casual but if Luka stops playing defense after getting blown by then forget mismatches, he&rsquo;s just gifting opposing teams uncontested looks and an entirely free offense.</p>

      <label for="l8idrqk" class="commentText"><p>Curry has an all time great motor so his effort was always there. Luka is in like the bottom one percent when it comes to being in shape so he&rsquo;d need to completely change his diet and exercise regimen to get there. I&rsquo;m truly not sure why he doesn&rsquo;t take that part of his career seriously. It&rsquo;s going to be his Achilles heel if he doesn&rsquo;t change his approach to training.</p>

      <label for="l8h674j" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s also not many stats that show Steph was ever getting &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; on defense. He held up really well in isolation. Harden&rsquo;s efficiency went down when he tried to relentlessly target Curry. In fact that&rsquo;s a theme against Golden State. Teams always thought they could target Steph but usually efficiency went down when they did so.</p>

<p>Sure, if LeBron got deep post position, he&rsquo;d score whenever he wanted. He&rsquo;s LeBron. He does that to basically everyone who isn&rsquo;t Kawhi and Iguodola.</p>

<p>There is such an obvious difference between Luka not giving a damn and Steph who just doesn&rsquo;t lack the physical tools to completely lock up the best scorers in the NBA. I will die on the hill that Steph was a decent defender in his prime.</p>

<p>Steph is a weak link in terms of how many guys see him as a good matchup one on one.</p>

<p>But Steph understands the team’s defensive schemes and rarely just gives up after a blow by or has no idea where he’s supposed to be on the floor.</p>

<p>Good team defense makes it easier to build a system that covers for the player’s weaknesses on ball. But even good on ball defenders will fuck over their team’s defense if they don’t know what to do off ball.</p>

<p>Their fans start spewing how they’re actually good defenders in matchups where they can hide on defense and do fuck all except deflect some passes and get a stop once in a blue moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty simple really. He&rsquo;s a decent defender closer to the paint thanks to his size and also a decent rebounder. He&rsquo;s bad at the perimeter against faster guys and falls asleep during defensive rotations. So that&rsquo;s where the dissonance comes from. He&rsquo;s decent at some parts of defending, bad at others.</p>

<p>Some people see him have good defensive possessions when there&rsquo;s physical contact in the paint and extrapolate that to say he&rsquo;s a good defender. Others see him get blown by on the perimeter and extrapolate that to say he&rsquo;s a terrible defender.</p>

      <label for="l8helqn" class="commentText"><p>Are you trying to say that being &ldquo;banged up&rdquo; is not the same as being injured? Lol. He has multiple injuries that most other players would probably sit out for. Had he sad out, the narrative would be that he quit on his team. It was a lose/lose situation for him.</p>

<p>He carries more of an individual load of a team&rsquo;s success than any other star in the league. Yes, he also needs to get his complaining under control, but this team far over-performed going from missing the playoffs to The Finals.</p>

<p>We have some glaring holes (we need 2 reliable 3&amp;D guys) to fill this offseason and our bench needs some work. If we can address those, we can get over the hump in the next few seasons.</p>

<p>Back to Luka, he needs to take a page from Dirk&rsquo;s book and go spend a week in the Australian outback for some self-reflection, then come back committed to maturing and taking care of himself like a professional athlete should. He needs to mature off the court (being a new dad, diet, fitness, managing emotions) as much as he does on it. He&rsquo;s 25 and just entering his prime.</p>

The guy manages to gain weight during a season. He barely has an offseason because of international play, but he still manages to show up to training camps out of shape many years. He’s an incredibly smart basketball player, and plays with old man skills that should age well. But given his history, I doubt he’s going to maintain what little athleticism he has for very long.</p>

<p>Yeah and it pisses me off every time. I feel like I&rsquo;m out here trying to talk people off a ledge every time a star player has some defensive or offensive woes. The Mavs had a great run to the finals and a lot of that was owed to Luka. He&rsquo;s not been having the best series right now, but lets not shoot him just yet.</p>

<p>But would that make him a better player in the long run if his weaknesses were so blatantly exposed like they are now? Sometimes an ass whooping like this will players a wake up call, that their current level and effort isn&rsquo;t good enough for an NBA championship. He&rsquo;s going to go down the same path as Harden if he doesn&rsquo;t improve in those aspects + conditioning.</p>

      <label for="l8gc3xl" class="commentText"><p>Mavs defensive gameplan this entire playoffs was to accommodate Luka by funneling drivers into help. So when Luka gets blown by it would at least not be free baskets, daring teams to beat them making kick out 3s. Forcing any difficult 2 would be a win.</p>

<p>This defense doesn&rsquo;t work against the Celtics cause they can play 5 out with multiple playmakers. OKC played a similar style offense but with only one playmaker and Shai is more willingly to jack up ill advised shots (and make them) than pass.</p>

<p>This was inevitable for the Mavs and I said weeks ago the only way they were gonna make this a series is if they could drill a shit ton of good 3s.</p>

You see the Celtics do this multiple times in a possession. Blow by Luka, draw in second defender kick to the shooter, force help defender to fly out on the shot, drive past a closing defender and repeat. Not only does it get open shots, but with the defense in scramble mode for 10-15 seconds every possession…that’s exhausting for the Mavs.</p>

      <label for="l8hoak8" class="commentText"><p>The Wolves can&rsquo;t play 5 out and so other Dallas defenders could sag off and protect the paint. It wasn&rsquo;t worth it for them to blow by Luka only to get lost in the trees. Boston forces  Dallas to stay out, making Luka a prime target for blowby bloodbaths.</p>

      <label for="l8glxo7" class="commentText"><p>Unpopular opinion as bad as those numbers are Luka defense isn&rsquo;t the reason Dallas is losing this series. There are at least five different reasons why they are losing and it doesn&rsquo;t involve luka defense. Dallas was a plus 9 when Luka was on the court in this game. For all the talk about &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; Dallas still played better and won the minutes that Luka was on the court. And throughout this series Dallas has played better despite the quote on quote &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; when Luka is on the court. Is he being targeted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but is that the reason why they are losing no!</p>

      <label for="l8hdpck" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s really the offense. We score both when he&rsquo;s in and out, but when he&rsquo;s in he can keep it close by scoring. When he or Kyrie is out and it&rsquo;s just the other guys, none of them have the offensive capability to make us suffer for the most part. Plus, we&rsquo;re stopping the 3 for the most part. Their run from 3 last night to get it back close was the first all series, and it was the first night Kyrie had been able to score on the level most expect him to.</p>

<p>The Pacers had multiple guys who could score and ran a faster offense, so they didn&rsquo;t really have any issues when resting guys. The Mavs aren&rsquo;t that great outside of Kyrie and Luka.</p>

<p>Jokes aside it has been known all of Luka&rsquo;s career that he sucks on defense. I said this when he was drafted that yes he could score in the NBA, but the question will be can he play defense.</p>

<p>And so just like Dirk the Mavs will need to make sure they have elite defenders all over the court to cover for Luka defensively.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been pure ass defensively in the Finals though.</p>

      <label for="l8hjxif" class="commentText"><p>I think to be real about it, they were &ldquo;blow bys&rdquo;! It&rsquo;s just that having the team clog and deny the paint was effective against those teams because they weren&rsquo;t as lethal as Boston is in a 5 out / jack up 3s offense. So we could live with it.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;funneling&rdquo; to our centers and help defense (while very true) was just a way to make up for getting blown by and us fans like the sound of it because we&rsquo;re biased and it sounds better.
But if you think about it, if we&rsquo;re focused on denying the paint to a team the best way to do it is to first stay in front and deny penetration and those contested outside shots would be even tougher for them. Trust me if Luka could stay in front on the perimeter there would be less talk of &ldquo;funneling&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Again, it worked, until it eventually doesn&rsquo;t unfortunately for us.</p>

      <label for="l8hzwy4" class="commentText"><p>Minnesota never attacked Luka. They just let him rest all day on defense. To a point where the announcers were even questioning it. Minnesota’s coaching was a huge part in their loss. Offensively they were crabs in a bucket and just kept running into the same wall. Idk if it was stubbornness or just plain dumb</p>

<p>Talk about being a traffic cone. And Mavericks fans really convinced the wider NBA fanbase that Luka is not a terrible defender lol, this is historically bad defense played this postseason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s bad on the perimeter, but not closer to the paint due to his size. That being said, they still beat the Clippers, Thunder and Wolves team in large part thanks to Luka. So as much as he&rsquo;s been trounced on the internet these past couple of days, he still deserves some credit for making it past those teams into the finals.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Celtics are just too good for the Mavs.</p>
