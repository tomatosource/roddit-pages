      <label for="l8gkvbb" class="commentText"><p>As people said before they don’t play five out which really stresses the Mavs. Also, KAT was really bad on open threes. The one game he hit they won.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t think people are taking account of the emotional hangover after beating Denver. I think they really couldn’t get up for the first game.</p>

<p>Plus, they had some defensive scheme issues ironically.</p>

      <label for="l8gs7jd" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, this is a pretty accurate read from my vantage point.</p>

<p>I think Dallas was just a horrible matchup for Minnesota (or maybe better put, Minnesota was a fantastic matchup for Dallas). The Mavericks defense is built upon having Gafford and Lively camp in the lane to shut down the rim. The Wolves pretty much always had someone the Mavs could ignore beyond 6 feet, be it Gobert, SloMo, or even McDaniels. Similarly, McDaniels, while not terrible offensively, uses length to score rather than speed, which allowed Luka to not get blown by so easily defensively. Plus the Wolves aren’t really a team to relentlessly attack a weak link. The Mavs also have only one real defensive stopper on the wing (DJJ) and the Wolves only really have one perimeter creator, which allowed Dallas to hold up in a way they aren’t against a team like Boston who has multiple legit perimeter creators.</p>

<p>On top of that, I think Minnesota was poorly situated to guard Dallas’ offense. They, unlike Boston or OKC, don’t really have the personnel to switch everything (Conley is too small, Rudy is a little too slow), which allowed Luka to always get the defender on his back which allowed him to dictate the pick and roll. I kind of wished the Wolves did a bit more of what Boston did with Porzingis (leaving Rudy to roam off of a weaker shooter and switching more in front), but it’s not necessarily a guarantee to work for the Wolves.</p>

<p>I also think shooting variance played a pretty big role in the series. Like you mentioned KAT was ice cold from deep all series long. When the Mavericks entire game plan revolves around clogging up the paint, that is a death sentence. But Dallas also had some positive shooting variance — Luka shot 43.4% against the Wolves on very difficult attempts, but is shooting only 32.1% against Boston. Kyrie shot 38% from deep against the Wolves and only 29% from deep against the Celtics (while also making pretty much all of his bullshit left handed scoop shots in that Wolves series). DJJ who is getting played off the floor because of his shooting against Boston, shot 46.6% from deep against the Wolves. On the whole, Dallas is shooting significantly worse on 3s versus Boston than Minnesota, although some of that is definitely a byproduct of good Celtics defense.</p>

<p>I’ll also just add, I think the schedule hurt Minnesota a lot. They got one fewer day of rest than Dallas and had to travel back from Denver. Like you said, they were exhausted (physically and mentally) from that Denver series and never really seemed to catch their rhythm at all. They came out flat in game 1 and 2 and bungled two winnable games. At that point, Dallas was in command and the every-other-day schedule meant Minnesota never had time to really reset or adjust. I also think Ant was at least somewhat hurt after that scary fall in game 6 — he looked off offensively for 3 straight games following that tumble, and slowly started to regain burst as the series wore on. All in all, it really hurt Minnesota’s ability to get their legs and create a real counter to Dallas’s play style (something Boston has had ample time to prepare for, which you can see in their execution).</p>

      <label for="l8h414s" class="commentText"><p>OKC&rsquo;s role players are all young and inexperienced guys tbh. There&rsquo;s a reason young teams don&rsquo;t win. PJ and DJJ were hot for sure, but also you have to consider that the Thunder&rsquo;s scheme was basically just conceding open 3&rsquo;s to them to take away Luka and Kyrie&rsquo;s stuff.</p>

<p>Boston is doing it differently. They are helping off of them above the break, but never enough that they can&rsquo;t run them off the 3pt line. They&rsquo;re content with switching everything when Porzingis is off the floor and giving up isolations to Luka and Kyrie to take them out of their pick and roll game and take away the lob threat. When they do make the kickout pass, most of the time the shooter is run off the line and forced to attack a closeout which they&rsquo;ve been terrible at. Tatum&rsquo;s ability to guard the Center, get bords and keep Horford/KP roaming has also been huge.</p>

<p>Also you guys held Dallas to a 113.4 offensive rating. Ironically, you guys <em>also</em> finished with a 113.4 offensive rating in the series, scoring the <em>EXACT</em> same amount of points, but your issue was that you couldn&rsquo;t get your offense working until it was too late. Giddey&rsquo;s minutes were slashed but he was completely ineffective in them and allowed the bigs to roam. The big problem was that you needed Dort out there for defense but he provided someone else that the Mavs felt comfortable enough helping off of.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there are zero players in the Celtics normal rotation that can be comfortably helped off of. All of their players except Porzingis, Al and Hauser are comfortable spotting up AND attacking closeouts. Although Al definitely can if he has space. Hauser is one of the best shooters in the league and KP and Al are two of the best floor spacing bigs in the game so they&rsquo;re still providing lots of value.</p>

<p>Everyone else can shoot <em>and</em> attack so with the way the Mavs are constructed their choices are to concede kickout passes or give Tatum and Brown comfortable layups. They&rsquo;ve chosen the former. It&rsquo;s damned if you do damned if you don&rsquo;t really. We&rsquo;re just impossible to guard. You have to hope we miss lol.</p>

      <label for="l8h9auk" class="commentText"><p>Oh for sure, okc deserved to lose the game. A few big differences between okc and the Celtics are visible here -</p>

<ul>
<li>I think the big flaw of the okc scheme that is not the case with the Celtics is the corner 3s. Okc gave up a ton of them and was slower to closeout</li>
<li>this is related to the fact that okc&rsquo;s defenders, while excellent, were smaller. Tatum being able to disrupt lobs and get boards is something okc struggled to do. Really I wanted more JWill+Chet lineups but Mark was uncomfortable with it.</li>
<li>obviously related is that Chet is still growing into his body and was clearly gassed by the second half of the season. He hasn&rsquo;t reached the point where he can play 82 and then go deep in the playoffs, his body couldn&rsquo;t make it. He&rsquo;s also not mastered rebounding to the degree someone like KP has, nor the quick shooting release - he can get there but he&rsquo;s not there yet.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure if helping off of Dort was the problem. He shot reasonably well iirc and was guarded more honestly. It was more that everyone else didn&rsquo;t step up. Giddey even in his limited minutes was no surprise, but I didn&rsquo;t expect to see Joe or Dub be quite so off. Aaron Wiggins was the only bright spot of attacking the rim, which is uncharacteristic of the team. Cason wallace played good d but was clearly overwhelmed offensively.</li>
<li>However the strategy of locking up Kyrie and Luka wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad one. I give a lot of credit to both jdub and Dort for making them shoot far below their averages. If you recall, they won game 6 on DJJ and PJ hitting some absolutely unreasonable shots in late clock situations. That&rsquo;s just how playoff basketball goes sometimes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially my point is that okc was poised in theory to do a lot of the same, albeit with one weak link in giddey (who played limited minutes anyways) and the bigger issue of just not being as big. Getting a solid wing 6&rdquo;8&rsquo;+ wing who can defend and rebound well and do at least a bit of everything else to replace giddey would catapult the team to the next level. I think a dude like markannen, despite his massive defensive limitations, would allow for the team to really step up, but I would be very happy if they get Kuz for example (though I&rsquo;m lower on Deni as I don&rsquo;t trust his offense). Snatching up KCP wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea either.</p>

<p>See this attitude everywhere with homers. In elections (Trump supporters in 2020), see it in basketball all the time, etc. Just learn how to take a loss graciously, and it&rsquo;s a 7 game series ffs. It&rsquo;s not even like football (soccer) or American tackleball (football) or NCAA college basketball where it&rsquo;s winner take all. So there&rsquo;s even less of a reason to complain.</p>

<p>But now, it&rsquo;s always some whining.</p>

<li><p>MIN doesn&rsquo;t have a great secondary ball handler/creator</p></li>

<li><p>Finch doesn&rsquo;t believe in matchup hunting or structure. His &ldquo;flow&rdquo; offense is all about moving the ball around quickly, driving, and making quick decisions until something opens up (which is kind of counter to KAT and Ant&rsquo;s games who both kind of like to hold the ball). His break-glass-in-case-of-emergency guy when things are stagnant is Jordan McLaughlin who plays fast, moves the ball, and generally brings a lot of energy.</p></li>

      <label for="l8gnai5" class="commentText"><p>Their star is 22 and never been that deep, and KAT is a big box of randomness as to how intelligent he&rsquo;s going to play that day, and neither are superstars. Everyone else the Mavs have played had former Superstars or current Superstars, and almost all of them were elite finishers and drivers at some point/currently.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, Ant isn&rsquo;t as good a passer as SGA, Harden, or Tatum, while getting that level of attention.</p>

      <label for="l8gxmff" class="commentText"><p>It’s fair to say KAT did not play particularly intelligently but by far the bigger issue was that his shot just wasn’t falling. He was 42% from 3 in the regular season, 44% from 3 in the first two rounds, and just hit a slump at the wrong time. 2-9, 1-5, 0-8, and 1-6 in the games they lost. Mavs played well on him on defense but he couldn’t hit even wide open ones. Happens.</p>

      <label for="l8gdpny" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, LeBron got blown by constantly in his peak defensive years in Miami when he matched up with smaller players, but fortunately the play doesn&rsquo;t end there. The same could also be said about Kobe during his peak years in 08-10. Defense is like 80% effort.</p>

      <label for="l8h0na6" class="commentText"><p>Everyone gets beat off the dribble in the NBA. It&rsquo;s impossible to completely lock down the best guards and wings. But you have to put up some resistance. You can direct them towards the help. There are things that can be done to make the blow by less detrimental. Luka just gets beat immediately over and over again.</p>

<p>He does that reach from behind where 1 out of 10 times he may tip the ball away. The other 9 times, his man gets into the paint and collapses the entire defense or has a wide open layup/dunk.</p>

<p>Luka doesn&rsquo;t even try. Maybe his injuries are really limiting him. I don&rsquo;t completely buy that because he still can get to the basket on offense. He can still play physical on that end of the ball. On defense though, he isn&rsquo;t even giving the slightest effort.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m honestly really disappointed watching him. Steph Curry is my favorite player. Whatever you want to say about Curry&rsquo;s limitations on defense, he at least gives a shit. He tries to keep his man in front of him, and he makes the right rotations. I was so excited to watch Luka in the Finals because I thought he was this genius basketball player who was going to make life miserable for Boston. Instead I saw him make a bunch of really difficult two pointers, throw a few nice passes, and get absolutely abused on defense while whining and complaining to the refs every possession.</p>

<p>I root for greatness. I haven&rsquo;t seen it this series from Luka. It&rsquo;s just disappointing to me.</p>

He&rsquo;s too fucking big and lumbering to keep up with some of these dudes, but he should be able to rotate and not fall asleep after the first blow by. Him not coming back on D after misses (while bitching to the refs or hanging his head) + not paying attention on second effort situations is what&rsquo;s been killing us.</p>

<p>That and the offensive dearth of the rest of the team, of course. For all his defensive woes he&rsquo;s a monster on offense and he&rsquo;s the only reason the Mavs are here at all. And fuck me if I ever have to see Hardaway and Green closing a finals game ever again.</p>

Harden&rsquo;s efficiency went down when he tried to relentlessly target Curry. In fact that&rsquo;s a theme against Golden State. Teams always thought they could target Steph but usually efficiency went down when they did so.</p>

<p>Sure, if LeBron got deep post position, he&rsquo;d score whenever he wanted. He&rsquo;s LeBron. He does that to basically everyone who isn&rsquo;t Kawhi and Iguodola.</p>

<p>There is such an obvious difference between Luka not giving a damn and Steph who just doesn&rsquo;t lack the physical tools to completely lock up the best scorers in the NBA. I will die on the hill that Steph was a decent defender in his prime.</p>

<p>Steph is a weak link in terms of how many guys see him as a good matchup one on one.</p>

<p>But Steph understands the team’s defensive schemes and rarely just gives up after a blow by or has no idea where he’s supposed to be on the floor.</p>

<p>Good team defense makes it easier to build a system that covers for the player’s weaknesses on ball. But even good on ball defenders will fuck over their team’s defense if they don’t know what to do off ball.</p>

<p>If you were going to try to get an isolation bucket would you rather go up against Draymond Green, Andre Iguodola, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes/Kevin Durant, or would you rather go after the 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; 185 pound guy?</p>

<p>His size prevents him from ever being a good defender, and that&rsquo;s ok. But he&rsquo;s made sure it doesn&rsquo;t make him a liability.</p>

<p>Also his IQ on defense is really fucking bad it&rsquo;s not just athleticism.</p>

<p>Steph at least had solid IQ and a high motor. Sure he would get hunted because of size but he was never THAT much of a liability.</p>

Luka&rsquo;s defensive effort was getting praised against the Thunder and especially against the Clippers and is honestly prob one of if not the biggest reason they even got passed the Clippers especially in games 2 and 6. The Mavs won against 3 great teams, the Celtics are just better. It&rsquo;s sad that for a lot of people Luka would be looked at better if the Mavs just lost close against the Timberwolves versus actually making the finals.</p>

      <label for="l8hbe3c" class="commentText"><p>They lost because KAT had a historically bad series shooting the three ball compared to his normal averages. In their losses he went 4-28. The one time he was effective from 3 they won. They had a good defensive scheme to stop the Timberwolves drives with their guys in the paint but it left KAT with a lot of open looks and he completely choked. It hurts to say because I love KAT but he absolutely choked in the biggest series of his career.</p>

      <label for="l8gc3xl" class="commentText"><p>Mavs defensive gameplan this entire playoffs was to accommodate Luka by funneling drivers into help. So when Luka gets blown by it would at least not be free baskets, daring teams to beat them making kick out 3s. Forcing any difficult 2 would be a win.</p>

<p>This defense doesn&rsquo;t work against the Celtics cause they can play 5 out with multiple playmakers. OKC played a similar style offense but with only one playmaker and Shai is more willingly to jack up ill advised shots (and make them) than pass.</p>

<p>This was inevitable for the Mavs and I said weeks ago the only way they were gonna make this a series is if they could drill a shit ton of good 3s.</p>

The difference between what KP thinks is open and what Chet thinks is open is staggering.</p>

<p>That’s why the Mavs gapping on drives bothered our non Shai players so much, but didn’t do a thing the Celtics.</p>

The TWolves can&rsquo;t effectively pull those dudes out of the paint with Gobert on the floor, and were bad with Gobert off the floor. Even though Naz lets them play more of a 5 out the Mavs could do whatever they wanted in the paint offensively when he was on the floor.</p>

There are at least five different reasons why they are losing and it doesn&rsquo;t involve luka defense. Dallas was a plus 9 when Luka was on the court in this game. For all the talk about &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; Dallas still played better and won the minutes that Luka was on the court. And throughout this series Dallas has played better despite the quote on quote &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; when Luka is on the court. Is he being targeted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but is that the reason why they are losing no!</p>

<p>Jokes aside it has been known all of Luka&rsquo;s career that he sucks on defense. I said this when he was drafted that yes he could score in the NBA, but the question will be can he play defense.</p>

<p>And so just like Dirk the Mavs will need to make sure they have elite defenders all over the court to cover for Luka defensively.</p>

When he or Kyrie is out and it&rsquo;s just the other guys, none of them have the offensive capability to make us suffer for the most part. Plus, we&rsquo;re stopping the 3 for the most part. Their run from 3 last night to get it back close was the first all series, and it was the first night Kyrie had been able to score on the level most expect him to.</p>

<p>The Pacers had multiple guys who could score and ran a faster offense, so they didn&rsquo;t really have any issues when resting guys. The Mavs aren&rsquo;t that great outside of Kyrie and Luka.</p>

      <label for="l8hjxif" class="commentText"><p>I think to be real about it, they were &ldquo;blow bys&rdquo;! It&rsquo;s just that having the team clog and deny the paint was effective against those teams because they weren&rsquo;t as lethal as Boston is in a 5 out / jack up 3s offense. So we could live with it.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;funneling&rdquo; to our centers and help defense (while very true) was just a way to make up for getting blown by and us fans like the sound of it because we&rsquo;re biased and it sounds better.
But if you think about it, if we&rsquo;re focused on denying the paint to a team the best way to do it is to first stay in front and deny penetration and those contested outside shots would be even tougher for them. Trust me if Luka could stay in front on the perimeter there would be less talk of &ldquo;funneling&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Again, it worked, until it eventually doesn&rsquo;t unfortunately for us.</p>
