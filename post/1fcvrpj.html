Now you can get them online or get lucky with special releases online with Sneakrs app but back then it was at your local Foot Locker or whatever sports apparel store was nearby.  There would be news reports all the time of fights and brawls if not worse related to his shoes.</p>

<p>Y&rsquo;all remember how big Starter jackets were back then too?  Dudes were getting killed over them.</p>

      <label for="lmc0n39" class="commentText"><p>Tbh, I don&rsquo;t remember.  My family was poor so Jordan&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t even on the radar for us.  I&rsquo;d just look at envy at the park when I&rsquo;d see kids with them.  I do recall though that they weren&rsquo;t released like they were today where you constantly have different colorways and all that.  It was Jordan 2 or Jordan 3 and that was that.  I imagine it was like most things during that time.   Word of mouth.</p>

<p>I remember the Reebok pumps too.  When they came out they were $180 in late 80s.  There was one kid at our entire school that had them.  His family was by far the richest.  Looking back I wonder why he went to a public school.</p>

      <label for="lmcgahq" class="commentText"><p>Back then, you could just walk into Foot Locker and buy them.  There were no such thing as special releases or anything like that.  They released one Jordan model per year and stock was extremely plentiful.</p>

<p>You have to remember, this is before there was a such thing as a sneakerhead, there was no secondary market yet, and there was no reason for the companies to limit production in order to drive hype and scarcity for future releases like they do today.</p>

<p>The biggest issue back then was that most people couldn&rsquo;t afford them because they were significantly more expensive than any other sneaker out there.</p>

<p>5% of that is <em>only</em> a few hundreds of millions in income a year that continues to grow.</p>

<p>Through 2020 that amounted to 1.3 billion total.</p>

<p>1.3 billion US dollars.</p>

<p>But apparently they didn&rsquo;t. I find it hard to believe Nike would have let him walk if he asked for 10% of the company.
I do get your point that it was not common back then. IIRC Magic turned down an equity stake on his first shoe deal that would be billions by now</p>

      <label for="lmc6gqx" class="commentText"><p>Basketball (as big as it is from a viewership point of view), isn’t as big from a participation/ playing point of view.</p>

<p>It’s largely a younger person’s sport (requires athleticism), and organised team sports in general take a big fall in participation for +30yr olds as work &amp; life takes over and it gets harder to find 9 other people to play with. It’s why golf &amp; tennis and  more solo activities like running, cycling, swimming become the more common ‘sports’.</p>

<p>Basketball, especially from a participation point of view, whilst huge in the US, but nowhere near as big anywhere else internationally. For every 1x person buying Jordans, they probably 10x buying running shoes or AF1s to just kick around in. Or football boots or soccer jerseys.</p>

<p>That said, the ‘sneaker culture’ in the US where 1x person buys 10x, 20x pairs of Jordans in a year - definitely helps skew the numbers back the other way.</p>

      <label for="lmciuuw" class="commentText"><p>Not underestimating- but the fact that Nike purposely limit the release of Jordans, means the average mum and pop can’t buy them to wear as everyday sneakers. Nike could easily flood the market, make a literal million pairs of a Jordan 1. GR it and sell it at every Dick Sporting Goods type store around the world. Like they have with the AF1s. But they don’t.</p>

<p>And ultimately it’s what keeps the ‘heads’ interested. Its limitedness is all that separates it from ‘cool’ and ‘not’. It also fuels the fire that makes Sneakerheads buy them.</p>

<p>Nike walk this line.</p>

<p>CCP told the factory to not put it so Nike looks bad and they obliged.</p>

<p>Imagine China caring about quality and brand names enough to fine someone, rofl. The whole chinese industry would be in shambles.</p>
