      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eentjc/rasheed_wallace_holds_the_record_for_most/"><p>Rasheed Wallace holds the record for most technical fouls.  Here&rsquo;s how much it would cost to break that record.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Rasheed Wallace has one of the most unique legacies of any NBA player.  A key contributor to the beloved 2004 NBA champion Detroit Pistons, 4x All-Star and coiner of the iconic phrase &ldquo;Ball don&rsquo;t lie!&rdquo;, the Hawks legend accomplished a great deal despite the many missed games and great antagonism he unleashed upon the NBA&rsquo;s officials, which brings up to Rasheed&rsquo;s most notorious accomplishment:  Setting a record that is considered amongst the hardest to break amongst all NBA records.</p>

<p>Rasheed Wallace holds the record for most career ejections with 29 and most technical fouls in a single season, which he both accomplished in <sup>2000</sup>&frasl;<sub>01</sub> and subsequently saw the league make changes to the issuing of technical fouls during Wallace&rsquo;s prime (Him and the refs did not get along in case you weren&rsquo;t familair with Sheed&rsquo;s game) that would make it more difficult for any later player to match or surpass Rasheed&rsquo;s sheer technical accumulation.</p>

<p>In 2006, the NBA changed the rules around technical fouls that made a player achieving - or even breaking - Rasheed&rsquo;s record of 41 technical fouls all the more difficult.  Specifically, it introduced a one-game suspension and increased fines following the 16th technical foul whereby a player would be suspended for every other technical received i.e. their 18th, 20th, 22nd, etc. technical would see them suspended for one game.</p>

<p>This made Wallace&rsquo;s 41 technical fouls one of the NBA&rsquo;s &ldquo;untouchable records&rdquo;&hellip;or did it?  And how much would this cost the absolute menace that would dare to take this technical crown from Rasheed?</p>

<p>Now, I do want to emphasize that this is mostly a thought exercise since in reality&hellip;no one has come close to 30 technical fouls, let alone 41 in a single season since 2006 aside Rasheed himself in <sup>2006</sup>&frasl;<sub>07</sub> where he got 28 to his name.  The highest amount of technical fouls we&rsquo;ve seen for a season since 2006 from a player <em>not</em> named Rasheed Wallace was Dwight Howard; Dwight managed to lead the league in <sup>2010</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> and <sup>2017</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> with 25 technical fouls.</p>

<p>For the 2020s, Draymond Green is the current record holder with 21 in <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.  If Draymond Green is barely cracking the halfway mark then a player trying to achieve this is going to have to be an absolute menace.  That or Draymond going on a retirement tour.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s say that such a player both exists, is consistently getting the playtime to allow for them to accumulate these technical fouls and that the regular season isn&rsquo;t shortened like it was when Wallace set the record.  Oh did I forget to mention that?  Yeah, he set the record with a shortened season of 77 games, meaning you were more likely than not to see Sheed tech&rsquo;d up over those 77 games.</p>

<p>Anyway let&rsquo;s break down the math on whether or not this can be done in theory.</p>

<p>Mathematically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two technical fouls are allowed per game (There was a game way back in the day where a player was given 3 techs but that was one of the few games the NBA both reviewed and approved of the protest.  This game also has a very weird bit of history where one player has played on two teams in a single game.)</li>
<li>After the 16th technical, a player receives a one game suspension for every 2 technical fouls they receive</li>
</ul>

<p>With this in mind, is getting 41 technical fouls even possible in today&rsquo;s NBA with these rule changes?</p>

<p>The answer is yes, but it would likely require a player to be notable enough to both get the playing time to accumulate these techs and simultaneously important enough for the league to not add on their own suspension because, if we&rsquo;re being realistic, the league would likely step in with a lengthy suspension of its own like it did with Draymond Green last season even if the reasons for the technical fouls to be accumulated would be something minor.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the least amount of games a player can play and break Rasheed&rsquo;s record?  Here&rsquo;s how little it could take without league intervention, in theory:</p>

<table>

<td align="left">42</td>
<td align="left">13; Suspended for Game 35 to bring the total to 14 games suspended</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>So how much would this cost?  For the fines specifically, let&rsquo;s take a look at the below:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Technical Foul #</th>
<th align="left">Fine</th>
<th align="left">Suspension</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">1st-5th</td>
<td align="left">$2,000</td>
<td align="left">None; player ejected if 2 technical fouls in same game</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">6th-10th</td>
<td align="left">$3,000</td>
<td align="left">None; player ejected if 2 technical fouls in same game</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">11th-15th</td>
<td align="left">$4,000</td>
<td align="left">None; player ejected if 2 technical fouls in same game</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">16th onward</td>
<td align="left">$5,000</td>
<td align="left">One game every 2 technical fouls; suspended on the 16th tech</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Keeping the above in mind, how much would it actually cost in fines for a player to break this record i.e. how much would it cost to actually get 42 technical fouls?</p>

<p>5 x <span class="math inline">\(2,000 = \)</span>10,000</p>

<p>5 x <span class="math inline">\(3,000 = \)</span>15,000</p>

<p>5 x <span class="math inline">\(4,000 = \)</span>20,000</p>

<p><strong>First 15 fouls = $45,000</strong></p>

<p>16th foul = $5,000</p>

<p>Every technical foul after 16 = 26 x <span class="math inline">\(5,000 = \)</span>130,000</p>

<p><strong>Total cost of techs = $180,000</strong></p>

<p>Now this figure isn&rsquo;t accounting for the player&rsquo;s salary part of this; when a player accumulates 16 technical fouls, they don&rsquo;t just lose out on <span class="math inline">\(5,000, they lose their pay for the game they're suspended for so the actual cost is really \)</span>180,000 <em>plus</em> a portion of that player&rsquo;s salary for <sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub> games.  Obviously this would more greatly affect a player on a minimum rather than, say, Jayson Tatum who&rsquo;s on a supermax but you get the idea.</p>

<p>So yes, this record is technically possible to break if the league doesn&rsquo;t intervene, and it can be yours for the low price of $180,000 and 14 game checks!</p>

      <label for="lfffpd5" class="commentText"><p>Nets-76ers in November 1978, referee Richie Powers issued three technical fouls each to a Nets player and coach.</p>

<p>The Nets successfully petitioned Larry O’Brien to replay the third and fourth quarters of the game. The replay only occurred the following March. In the intervening time, Eric Money, Harvey Catchings, and Ralph Simpson were traded between the Nets and 76ers. Since those three all saw playing time in both instances of the game, they all hold the distinction of having played in one game for two teams. Money holds the distinction of being the only player to score for two teams in the same game, having made a basket in both instances.</p>

<p>Also, Al Skinner was involved in the trade, but didn’t see playing time in either instance of the game, making him the only player to get a DNP from two teams in the same game.</p>

      <label for="lfffuw0" class="commentText"><p>It was a 76ers/Nets game back in 1978. The TL;DR is that one of the Nets players got tech&rsquo;d up, ejected, issued a 3rd tech and then the coach got tech&rsquo;d up 3 times.  The Nets protested the game and this was one of the few games where the league approved of the protest, restarting the game from the second technical/ejection of Bernice King.</p>

<p>This took a few months to actually re-do the match and in that time there were trades made.  One of those trades involved Eric Money being sent from the Nets to the Sixers where he would play in that game and score 4 points for the Sixers and thereby became the only player to ever score for two teams in the same game.</p>

<p>Oh and fun fact:  In the first iteration of this game, Phil Jackson assumed the coaching duties of the ejected coach for the rest of the game since he was just an AC at the time.</p>
