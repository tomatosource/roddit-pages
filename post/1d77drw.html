<p>But to be fair, Brown was the definition of a RAW prospect. I don’t blame people for wondering if he would ever reach his ceiling. He worked incredibly hard to develop into the player he is now.</p>

<p>(he also doesn’t have huge hands for his size, which limits his creative finishing a bit)</p>

      <label for="l6yovpl" class="commentText"><p>I did think it was a good trade for Boston, because we were clearly done. But on the other hand, I somehow expected those Nets to win a chip or two. And I think they would have considered it all worth it if they did. But then they lost in year 1, Pierce bounced, and the backfire started backfiring SO hard..</p>

<p>Yep, and then they went and got AK47 and people started legit saying it was unfair how good the Nets have gotten. Think there was some gray-area type aspect to them signing AK, like he took a discount and would get compensated via other channels or something. People were mad that the Russian billionaire was just gonna get a ring like that.</p>

If Jrue wasn’t made available the Celtics would’ve still been in a really good position to trade for another star with Brogdon, Timelord, and multiple picks</p>

Jrue was the perfect guy to land. Essentially we gave up Timelord, Smart, Brogdon, and picks for Porzingas and Jrue. Personally didn&rsquo;t love losing Smart especially with Porzingas injury history but kind of unstood it at the time. Landing Jrue made the whole off-season brilliant yet again</p>

      <label for="l71n3pl" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this is a big part of it.</p>

<p>Miami had 2 first round picks available to trade. All their other picks were tied up in other trades. Most people couldn&rsquo;t tell you who Miami had previously traded for to lose all those picks.</p>

<p>Terry Rozier is one of their most significant trades of the past half-decade and that came after the Dame/Holiday situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Boston had traded for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Irving</li>
<li>Morris</li>
<li>Walker</li>
<li>Horford</li>
<li>White</li>
<li>Brogdon</li>
<li>Porzingis</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s 4 All-Stars, 1 All-D and 2 6MOTY calibre players.</p>

<p>And we still had pretty much all our own picks + more from other teams left to work with when we were negotiating for Holiday.</p>

<p>In that same span we&rsquo;d also added these Boston rookies to the roster:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brown</li>
<li>Tatum</li>
<li>G.Williams</li>
<li>R.Williams</li>
<li>Pritchard</li>
<li>Hauser</li>
</ul>

<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;d been forgoing our usual drafting-and-developing to bring in all those quality players via trades. We hadn&rsquo;t really given up on our past drafting and we didn&rsquo;t have to sell our future trade.</p>

<p>Even in the Holiday trade we only gave up 1 future first round pick of our own. The other was a GSW pick we&rsquo;d grabbed along the way.</p>

<p>Looking at our future draft situation right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a 2028 pick-swap to San Antonio - Boston should still be good. San Antonio might be good. The pick swap shouldn&rsquo;t really matter unless we have a disaster year.</li>
<li>We owe Portland a 2029 pick outright.</li>
</ul>

<p>We then own the rest of our first round picks outright.</p>

The last time that happened, it turned into Al Horford, now history repeats itself. It&rsquo;s the type of high risk move a rebuilding team wants to make. Kemba turned out to be actually cooked, but maybe Portland finds out Brogdon can still get back to form, and we know Williams can be a monster even in a Finals environment, it was worth a shot to take that flyer on him.</p>

Once Kemba&rsquo;s knees went out, he couldn&rsquo;t generate the spacing he needed as a small guard. At least you know whenever Brogdon is healthy enough to play, he&rsquo;s going to be efficient at scoring, and can hold his own defensively.</p>

      <label for="l6xs0ns" class="commentText"><p>I maintain that Portland took the right trade despite the Heat fans sounding off all year. They keep calling every single one of their prospects &ldquo;the Dame package&rdquo; but the reality is Portland wasn&rsquo;t offered all of them. The rumor is they were offered Herro, two firsts, ONE of their prospects (like Jovic), and one of their contracts (Robinson or Lowry) see <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2023/09/27/bucks-damian-lillard-trade-heat-offer-comparison" target="_blank">here</a>. There were rumors that Jaquez wasn&rsquo;t even on the table. If Portland took that deal they would have ended up with two potential firsts that probably would have been in the middle of the round (Heat always finish in the middle). They would have been forced to find a way to flip both Herro and Lowry/Robinson which wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten them what Boston gave for Jrue but yeah&hellip; Jovic would have been a nice piece&hellip; not an all-star but sure a nice piece. The package they got blows that out of the water imo. They got 3 firsts. The two swaps they got are when Middleton and Dame are probably either retired or just completely done. Giannis might even have fallen off by then so there is a good chance those are top 10 picks. If all three retire or get moved maybe they become lottery picks. Brogdon and Timelord can be flipped pretty easy for 2nds (Brogdon when healthy won 6th man and Timelord is DPOY caliber. A team would easily make a minor move to have that on the bench). Ayton is a fine player to have while you are rebuilding. I don&rsquo;t know how you can look at this trade and think the Miami trade would have been better for a rebuild.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>That KG/PP original trade thread is incredible. I love the Celtics fan who wrote &ldquo;Welp. See you guys in the 2017 playoffs.&rdquo; As it turns out, they were back in the playoffs by &lsquo;<sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> (only missed the playoffs one year) and were back in the ECF by 2017. Bastards.</li>
<li>I honestly had forgotten how much people clowned the original pick of Brown. People were <strong>SUPER</strong> skeptical.</li>
<li>I dunno &lsquo;bout y&rsquo;all, but it feels like a fever dream that Horford signed with the Celtics, somehow left in FA and went to Philly, had a spell in OKC, and ended up circling back there. I forgot about it until compiling this. It&rsquo;s wild to think of this Boston core <em>without</em> him.</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t believe the Celtics got Derrick White for goddamn Josh Richardson. Shoutout to /u/p0tatoman <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/spdh9i/charania_the_boston_celtics_are_trading_josh/hwefi8y/" target="_blank">nailing it.</a></li>

<p>We got a first and a nearly unprotected swap too. Blame other teams for not beating the celtics offer. I knew as soon as the trade happened, we got the worse end of the deal but teams were worried about White&rsquo;s shooting and health I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>

<p>Going back to his sophomore year (rookie year spent in the G-League) we saw flashes as he played alongside DeRozan and LMA (Murray tore his ACL) and had that damn near perfect game against the nuggets in game 3 of the 19 playoffs. His issues always came down to some mix of confidence/consistency. But the Spurs were deadset on tanking and decided to pull the trigger for what they got.</p>

<p>Most of us were ok with the trade at the time.</p>

<p>For the spurs, they didn’t get the best deal but this allowed them to tank enough and get the best Prospect they could’ve hoped in Wemby. It worked out for both sides and the player himself. Love this trade</p>

      <label for="l6xc5fi" class="commentText"><p>People have doubted Brown every step of the way. Most Celtics fans wanted Kris Dunn&hellip;including me. When he got his first big contract, he was considered to be overpaid and Celtics got clowned for it. In time, it became super valuable. This past off-season he signs the biggest contract in NBA history and he got clowned once again. This has been by far his best season ever, even if his numbers don&rsquo;t show it.</p>

<p>One of the most annoying things about the White trade was how many people got hung up on the pick swap. People seemed to have no idea that trading a pick swap and trading a 1st Rounder were completely different. The difference became important this year when we traded the 2029 1st Rounder for Jrue, (because the Stepien rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to the 2028 pick swap).</p>

<p>A big one you left out though was the signing of Schroder in 2021. The series of moves afterwards exemplified Brad’s long time coaching mantra of “hitting singles”.</p>

<p><em>Runner on 1st</em></p>

<p>Weaponizing their taxpayer MLE that offseason into tradable salary allowed Brad to salary stack for Theis at the 2022 deadline.</p>

<p><em>Runners on 1st and 2nd</em></p>

<p>And while Theis played a role in adding depth for a Final run, his contract was ultimately the necessary driver to satisfy salary matching rules in a trade for Brogdon in the 2022 offseason.</p>

<p><em>Bases loaded</em></p>

<p>And again, while Brogdon played a key role as a 6MOY in their near Finals run last season, his contract was the salary ballast that allowed Boston to make a huge move for Holiday to replace Smart who had been essentially shipped out for Porzingus. Boston casually landing Jrue in the end was like a runner at 3rd half-sprinting to home plate off yet another single.</p>

<p><em>Runs start pouring in</em></p>

<p>This year’s Finals appearance aside, you have to wonder what their next moves will look like. Jrue can still be flipped towards the end of his extension for yet another useful player (albeit one who makes less money than him) that would not be available to a capped out team. At a time when Boston should be adding around the margins with veteran minimums as the Jays enter their 30s, instead Brad will have Jrue’s contract to work with (and Zinger’s). I’m not sure if a team has ever been assembled with a combination of this level of talent, cohesion, and roster flexibility.</p>

<p>I’d argue that Brad’s most important move was that last minute deadline deal of aggregating Schroder, Freedom, and Fernando into Theis. Without that chunk of matching salary, none of this is possible - both what has happened thus far and again, what has yet to come to pass…</p>

<p>On top of that, Brad was able to thread the needle in getting this done before the new apron rules, impressively salary stacking from a ~5mil contract to a 30mil+ contract in less than 2 years like this was a 2k franchise. That’s why he’s executive of the year in my book - the Theis trade.</p>

      <label for="l6xxclv" class="commentText"><p>For anyone interested, here was the thought process going into the trade:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nets were a 4 seed. And this was after a coaching change. They start the season 15-15, and close out the season going 34-18 (.65).</p></li>

<li><p>Post-ASB, 28-yo DWill is playing like one of the best players in the league. He has injections in his ankles to keep him moving. Many think after an off-season of rest, he will go into the next season in peak form.</p></li>

<li><p>Brook is coming off his first All-Star appearance.</p></li>

<li><p>Most projected them to win the first round of the playoffs, but they fall to the Bulls in 7 games. They lose due to a perceived lack of &ldquo;heart.&rdquo; Deron, Joe, and Brook were never known as guys to inspire their teams, and reflected against Joakim and Nate Robinson&rsquo;s performance, it looked even worse.</p></li>

<li><p>Another factor in the playoffs loss is the starting lineup - outside of the Nets backcourt, there were no shooters. Gerald Wallace and Reggie Evans could never hit a basket, and Brook wasn&rsquo;t yet the evolved form of himself.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you could add more spacing, help Brook with some defense on the inside, and inject some life into Deron and Joe, you could see this four seed being a true threat to the Heatle&rsquo;s reign.</p>

<p>KG, PP, and Jason Terry did exactly that. They were supposed to play supporting roles and bring their culture to the emotionless Nets roster. The Nets even bring in AK47 for the dirty work. People were saying this team was unfair.</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We find out that Brook and KG are a tough pairing (Brook going out for the season turns out to be a blessing in disguise and turns into a 9 game winning streak).</p></li>

<li><p>The team has crazy injuries to start the season and struggle to get in rhythm.</p></li>

<li><p>JKidd was barely learning how to coach and throws his head assistant out (who, at the time, the Nets paid the highest assistant salary ever to the guy).</p></li>

<li><p>Deron was never able to recover from his injuries and reportedly had a terrible attitude.</p></li>

<li><p>And so KG and PP had to shoulder too much of the load.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The &ldquo;on-paper&rdquo; Nets were going to be a great team. Too many things didn&rsquo;t click, and the Nets don&rsquo;t even resign Paul Pierce the following year.</p>

<p>And for that, enjoy your 2024 Boston Celtics!</p>

They were 37 and 36! I just thought there was no way the Nets were that close (and then D-Will and KG fell off a cliff anyway)</p>

      <label for="l6zboou" class="commentText"><p>It wasn&rsquo;t toooo silly of an idea. Nets had won four really close games against the Heat, which had (supposedly) shown off the Nets role players. Mason Plumlee has a game winning block on LeBron, Mirza could light into the Heat from 3, and Shaun Livingston&rsquo;s resurgence gave us a ton of length in our starting lineup.</p>

<p>The Heat were always better, but the coaching involved in the playoffs absolutely screwed the Nets. Kidd couldn&rsquo;t match up with Spo.</p>

<p>DWill also had his infamous 0-9 game. Which led to an all time quote from Kobe &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go 0-30 than 0-9.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To put even extra context to the quote, Kobe wasn&rsquo;t even in the playoffs that year. He was being asked about Dwill&rsquo;s performance because whether or not the Nets could beat the Heat was a real discussion.</p>

<p>I will always argue that the 5 game series the Nets played against the Heat was a more competitive series than the 6 game ECF against the Pacers. But at the end of the day, Brooklyn was never able to get out of the second round, so it&rsquo;s moot 🤷‍♂️</p>

      <label for="l6ysybj" class="commentText"><p>From what I remember Portland let Jrue give them a list and Boston was on it.</p>

<p>List was Heat (Never happening after the entire Dame saga), both LA teams (No assets) and Boston.</p>

<p>So here was Jrue becoming a Celtic.</p>

<p>But I will sumarize since I followed along live</p>

<p>Jrue white and brogdon all put Celtics on their short list and all had good relationships with the people trading them</p>

<p>in Jrue s case the blazers GM was trying to build some good will.</p>

<p>In brogdons case he had us at top
Of his list and he is a veteran with good relationship</p>

<p>Spurs loved derrick and presented Derrick with some options and Derrick chose the 30 mins a night in a contender choice.</p>

      <label for="l6yela1" class="commentText"><p>Putting Boston on a list of 5 or so teams, especially when they were already a perennial favorite in the East, isn’t really choosing Boston specifically. It’s not like those guys chose Boston over other teams in the FA market, that’s always been the main criticism.</p>

Wow</p>

<p>Some more hilarity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Celtics fans always hold Ainge in high regard, but theyve been really boasting about this nets pick more than anything. I think Ainge is his best at trading players rather than drafting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ainge proceeds to draft the best player in the draft back to back years at #3.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HE OVERTHOUGHT IT. OMG.</p>

<p>Seeing tons of people laughing at this pick, and it will end up being viewed as idiotic and brought up many times by Celtics fans next season. I don&rsquo;t know if it will be Porzingis-levels of wrongness but he isn&rsquo;t gonna be utterly atrocious and guys like Dunn and Murray won&rsquo;t make this pick look idiotic. He&rsquo;ll do just fine as any rookie and beyond that we&rsquo;ll see if he&rsquo;s moved fo a bigger piece along with other assets in a massive deal.</p>

Smart is great.
Huge heart.
Good ballplayer&hellip;.. similar to holiday in some ways.</p>

<p>But Jrue brings crucial things Smart doesn&rsquo;t.
A steadiness on both ends
Doesn&rsquo;t take the offense hostage
Has a cutting/under the basket game smart lacks</p>

      <label for="l6xsfaj" class="commentText"><p>I said this earlier in this thread but he could have just taken his actual role, 3 and D wing, but he&rsquo;s obsessed with running the offense at the point, which he can do but nowhere near as well as Hali or well enough for someone without much playmaking. He has all the tools to be a starter on a competing team, but won&rsquo;t take the role needed to do it. He also is injury prone so really can&rsquo;t force teams to let him do what he wants</p>

The talent is obvious, but he&rsquo;s still lacking playoff experience, and he&rsquo;s been injured for the most important part of the season. He&rsquo;s been fun to have on the team this year, but his play in the finals will sort of determine the success of the trade.</p>

      <label for="l6yya8b" class="commentText"><p>Feels weird to see all the comments on the first Brown extension talking about how it’s outrageous he’s making so much more money than Buddy Hield and how the Hield contract is a steal. Then both of those contracts aged in the opposite direction to what everybody assumed at the time.</p>

      <label for="l6zhwfu" class="commentText"><p>Great post. It&rsquo;s always so interesting to look back on the reactions for big moves in sports subs. It&rsquo;s a good reminder that we all feel like we are experts, but at the end of the day we actually don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking about most of the time.</p>

<p>I, like most people, shit on the Mavs trading for Kyrie. I thought it was short-sighted and would blow up their faces. Never thought they&rsquo;d be more than a 6-8 seed who maybe wins a round. Yet here they are in the Finals. So, the trade was undoubtedly a success. They have a real shot at winning a chip with this squad. Even if they lose, I think most Mavs fans would say the trade worked out.</p>

<p>Hindsight ofc is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> but it&rsquo;s still fun going through these old posts. Thank you for taking the time to compile them.</p>
