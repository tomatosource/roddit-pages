      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e90m9x/oc_creating_a_zscore_relative_ts_zts_metric_that/"><p>[OC] Creating a Z-Score relative TS% (zTS%) Metric that allows for easier comparisons across eras and how it&rsquo;s an improvement over existing measures of TS%, TS+% and rTS%.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>Existing TS% Metrics in the NBA</strong></p>

<p>In the NBA, efficiency metrics like True Shooting Percentage (TS%), Relative True Shooting Percentage (rTS), and True Shooting Plus (TS+) have been ubiquitous for evaluating player performance. However, these metrics have limitations that a Z-score normalized metric can address.</p>

<p>But before I get to these limitations, a brief review for what these metrics set to achieve -</p>

<p><strong>True Shooting Percentage (TS%)</strong>:</p>

<p>TS% is a shooting efficiency metric that accounts for field goals, three-point field goals, and free throws.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>TS% is a raw percentage and does not account for the context within the league or the variability among players. Nor does it account for league-wide growth</li>
<li>It treats all players equally without considering how they compare to the league average.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Relative True Shooting Percentage (rTS%):</strong></p>

<p>rTS% measures a player&rsquo;s TS% relative to the league average TS%.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>While it contextualizes a player&rsquo;s performance, it does not account for the distribution or variability of TS% within the league.</li>
<li>It can be influenced by extreme values (outliers), skewing the perception of a player&rsquo;s efficiency based on outliers.</li>
<li>Harder to interpret due to the lack of a normalized metric.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>True Shooting Plus (TS+):</strong></p>

<p>TS+ is an index where 100 represents the league average, and values above or below 100 indicate better or worse performance, respectively. It is widely considered the gold standard for comparing efficiency metrics across NBA eras, although it has similar limitations to the rTS%, it does normalize to some extent.</p>

<p><strong>Creating the Z-score normalized TS%</strong></p>

<p>Z-score normalization converts individual data points into a measure of standard deviations away from the mean which accounts for the distribution of scores and the variability.</p>

<p>Z-scores are a superior method for normalizing efficiency metrics in the NBA due to their ability to provide contextual relevance, robustness to outliers, enhanced comparability across eras, and clearer interpretation. While traditional metrics like TS%, rTS, and TS+ are valuable, they lack the depth and robustness that Z-scores offer. By adopting Z-score normalization, we can achieve a much more accurate and comprehensive understanding of player performance across eras with ease of interpretation.</p>

<p>To understand the process behind the estimation of the metric, here&rsquo;s a stepwise list -</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All TS% scores filtered ordered and the top 90% based on the possession&rsquo;s played were filtered for further analysis to remove smaller sample sizes and extreme outliers.</p></li>

<li><p>All filtered TS% scores were scaled and centred based on the gaussian(normal) distribution. To examine how well the scores distributed, Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was conducted across 32 seasons. (NOTE: Shapiro-Wilk is fairly flawed but still a good rudimentary judge for examining the distribution).</p></li>

<li><p>All the Z-scores were converted back to percentile norms for ease of comparison using the normal distribution. You can refer to the probabilities of a standard normal distribution to get a better idea for the conversion.</p></li>

<li><p>The final output was a new zTS% metric that allows easier comparison across eras.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How is it an improvement?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Robustness to Outliers</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Outliers are extreme values that can disproportionately affect statistical analyses.</li>
<li>Z-scores reduce the impact of outliers by contextualizing each player&rsquo;s performance within the league&rsquo;s overall variability. Extreme values have less influence on the mean and standard deviation compared to how they would skew simple averages or ratios.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Interpretability</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Z-scores standardize the scale of measurement, making it easier to compare performances across different seasons or contexts. A Z-score of 1.0, for example, consistently indicates one standard deviation above the mean, regardless of the underlying distribution&rsquo;s specifics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Translating Z-Scores into Percentiles</strong>:

<ul>
<li>By converting Z-scores to percentiles, we provide an intuitive measure of performance. A player with a zTS% of 85% is more easily understood as being in the top 15% of efficient players in the league.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Kobe, an inefficient chucker or a product of his era?</strong></p>

<p>The only thing left was to put this new method to the test using the most controversial player of the modern era - Kobe Bryant. Kobe, who&rsquo;s often considered an inefficient player compared to several stars.</p>

</table>
<p>Based on the above, you can say that Kobe has always been around 80th percentile in terms of league efficiency across most of his prime, or you can simply state that he was more efficient than 80% of the league during his prime.</p>

<p>Similarly for Lebron -</p>

<p>You can see that he&rsquo;s hovered around the 90th percentile during his prime and that number jumps up to 98th percentile during 2012-13 and 2013-14.</p>

<p><strong>How to Access the data</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am still in the process of creating the app so all the data is publicly available but in the meantime if you&rsquo;re interested in data for a single player, I created a hacky solution for you - <a href="https://codepen.io/Gareth-Bale-the-bashful/pen/qBzZejW" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/Gareth-Bale-the-bashful/pen/qBzZejW</a></p>

      <label for="leb5hld" class="commentText"><p>I just put the methodology for those interested.</p>

<p>Simply put, it&rsquo;s telling you the percentage of players you are more efficient than in a given season adjusting for outliers, eras and variance. Kobe who is considered an inefficient chucker was in the 80th percentile for the majority of his career (more efficient than 80% of the players). Dirk, who hovered around 55 to 60% TS for his entire career had multiple seasons in the 90th percentile.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just an easy way to see how efficient a player is relative to their own eras and to compare efficiency metrics across eras.</p>

<p>But, I think you should include RTS or TS+ (either or) alongside the Z score. I’m interested in your reasonings for not valuing it, if you have examples of it’s outliers that would be interesting to see.</p>

      <label for="leb8mh3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I should&rsquo;ve included it! The main advantage is the ease of interpretation compared to other metrics and robustness.</p>

<p>But the reasoning behind it was as follows -</p>

<p>Z-score percentiles are superior to mean based (rTS% and TS+%) comparisons because they provide a more nuanced understanding of a a player&rsquo;s relative standing within a single season. The mean comparisons can indicate whether a value is above or below the average TS% for the season but the average does not account for the  variability or potential outliers. The biggest problem was not weighing the efficiency metrics based on shots attempted.</p>

<p>Z-scores, on the other hand, standardize values by converting them into the number of standard deviations they are from the mean, allowing for a clearer assessment of how extreme or typical a value is within the context of the entire dataset. They also facilitate the comparison of players from different seasons or conditions, which makes them more robust.</p>

<p>I’m also rusty on my statistics but with a sample size of the whole NBA (ie when we compare to league average) isn’t the effect of outliers/variance likely to be diminished?</p>

      <label for="lebdmoj" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s easier to explain by listing the formulas to show where they are flawed -</p>

<p>TS = points / (2 * fga + 0.88 * fta)</p>

<p>rTS = playerTS - leagueTS</p>

<p>TS+ = 100 * (playerTS / leagueTS)</p>

<p>You can see that none of these formulas incorporate variability. Some NBA seasons have more variability around the mean, some have less. That information is not being incorporated at all within the estimation. It&rsquo;s simply a deviation from the mean (which is the simplest form of deviation).</p>

      <label for="lec8cil" class="commentText"><p>I was also confused until I saw the formula but now I get it, so for example:</p>

<p>Hypothetically if in 1965 the mean league TS was 50%, and a player shot 55%, they would have an rTS of 5%, but that might only put them in the 70th percentile (TS distribution is a wide bell curve centered around 50%).</p>

<p>But if in the year 2065 the mean league TS is 80%, and a player shot 85%, they would also have an rTS of 5%, but that would actually put them in the 90th percentile (TS distribution is now a much more narrow bell curve centered around 80%).</p>

<p>So despite have the same rTS, their percentile relative to the rest of the league is much higher in 2065. rTS is definitely very flawed</p>

I’m just trying to rationalise what changes this metric might do to our understanding of efficiency over time. ie is there any examples historically where the z scores might tell us something different about a player or season that rTS or TS+ havent already told us.

      <label for="leetrg3" class="commentText"><p>You should probably be calling this a <em>t</em>-true shooting percentage. A z-score is when we normalize by the <em>known</em> standard deviation and average. But you are using data here to <em>estimate</em> the standard deviation and average. We usually call that situation a t-statistic.</p>

<p>But I would change two things here: 1) dropping &ldquo;outliers&rdquo; is a questionable practice, and it sounds like you are doing it on an ad-hoc basis. The observations you are dropping are real data and were probably extreme for a reason. Cutting these out could lead to misleading understanding of the data. I would limit your dropping of observations to those with, say, under a certain number of minutes, or something that isn&rsquo;t directly the thing you are trying to measure (TS%, in this case).</p>

<ol>
<li>Instead of computing the t-stat here and then using a normal distribution to convert to percentiles (which assumes the form of the distribution and restricts it to be the same each year), just skip the t-stat all together and just limit those with few minutes from the data, then directly compute the percentile in the year&rsquo;s data for each year. That is, sort the TS%s each year and convert the values directly to percentiles. This avoids the distributional assumption. This approach will be much easier to explain and for audiences to understand.</li>

      <label for="leeejgc" class="commentText"><p>I think the biggest thing missing from TS stats will always be positional role and shot diet.</p>

<p>A big taking 90% of shots down low will always have higher TS in a vacuum than a guard, but you need three point shooting to space the floor to create interior scoring.  It generates more than just an extra point.  There are also arguments you could make that elite midrange efficiency is rarer and offers more versatility than elite interior efficiency, even though the point return is the same.</p>

<p>There has to be some adjustment for shot diet/distance to make the stat a fair comparison of scoring value across different positional roles.</p>

<p>I was actually going to improve it further by using shot difficulty using average shot distances to incorporate more relative features. That&rsquo;s the next goal anyways. I figured guys like Dirk/KD shouldn&rsquo;t be penalized for size/position based corrections because of their shot diet. The plan is to incorporate each players individual shot distance average and deviation in the normalization process.</p>

      <label for="lecb46j" class="commentText"><p>I think this would actually be a mistake. If the goal is efficiency as a scorer, it should not reward players for taking high difficulty shots. That&rsquo;s part of how one becomes efficient. If the goal is just to quantify &ldquo;who is good at making shots&rdquo; sure you can normalize for Distance from the basket or distance of nearest defender, etc. But this penalizes players for getting open looks and taking good shots. It&rsquo;s an interesting metric in some ways but less relevant for efficiency as a scorer.</p>

      <label for="lecp9c6" class="commentText"><p>Disagree a bit, it penalizes the players whose gravity (due to ability to hit tough shots) can generate open looks for others. Especially in that 00s wing era, open looks were often predicated on elite scorers demanding additional attention. If we&rsquo;re talking about generating efficiency, is person who can hit the catch and shoot open corner 3 at a league average rate really more efficient than the scorer who can make a double team fade away a league average offensive option?</p>

      <label for="lebjevv" class="commentText"><p>If this helps, OP created an app that calculates for example Kobe Bryant’s 2005-06 season, compares his TS% to every single player that played in that season only, and ranks his TS% vs them. If you don’t understand statistics, scroll to the very last column on the right called TS PERC. If that number is 90, that means Kobe’s TS% was in the top 90%ile that season, or his TS% was better than 90% of players that season only.</p>

<p>This allows you to compare a player in 2006 against a player in 1974 based on how much better they were against their peers in that era. Then you can say Kobe was better than x% of players in TS% in his season, then compare that against Lebron in 2012.</p>

<p>If two players have the same rTS%, but the first guy did it back when his competition was regularly shooting contested 20 footers, isn’t the second guy still marginally better?</p>

      <label for="lec4f30" class="commentText"><p>Not good/bad decisions, it was difference in play style. A guy shooting a contested 20 footer at times was exactly how the team offense was constructed (see the AI 76ers). So again, you&rsquo;d be penalizing a player for playing within the schemes of his era. A lot of those guys&rsquo; shooting efficiency jumps up when you rate their relative efficiency + shot difficulty (i.e. the guy shooting 40% on highly contested 2s is likely the better shooter than the guy shooting 35% on wide open 3s). It also might shift our understand of player specific efficiency, in that the more efficient player might be the guy who can generate efficiency in low efficiency situations vs the guy who gets high efficiency in high efficiency situations.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There&rsquo;s a both/and here. Most guys weren&rsquo;t training to shoot 3s on volume, weren&rsquo;t practicing to get their shots off from various angles behind the line, and the traditional power forward was a thing, so floor spacing was very different. I know you&rsquo;re not saying it, but it&rsquo;s not like Pop&rsquo;s Spurs would have benefitted from sticking Duncan in the corner, and there weren&rsquo;t very many 4s (let alone 3s) who could do that with great consistency.</p></li>

      <label for="lebz4ek" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m confused&hellip; if you&rsquo;re putting all the TS values together, then you won&rsquo;t do any better at comparing across eras than just using TS. The most efficient players in an inefficient era will look bad by this metric. Do you mean that you compute z scores within each season?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A player with a zTS% of 85% is more easily understood as being in the top 15% of efficient players in the league.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&rsquo;s the point of even using a z score in this case? Can&rsquo;t you just calculate the percentile directly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All filtered TS% scores were scaled and centred based on the gaussian(normal) distribution. To examine how well the scores distributed, Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was conducted across 32 seasons. (NOTE: Shapiro-Wilk is fairly flawed but still a good rudimentary judge for examining the distribution).</p>

<p>What were the results of this test? Do you have a histogram of the data?</p>

      <label for="lecch0u" class="commentText"><p>Good point about the outliers; I think I had a question about that but deleted it. OP mentions outliers as being a limitation for several metrics, and outliers might imply that a Z score is inappropriate. It also includes a brief discussion of preventing outliers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All TS% scores filtered ordered and the top 90% based on the possession&rsquo;s played were filtered for further analysis to remove smaller sample sizes and extreme outliers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but in addition to this sentence being confusing, it seems like the only outlier prevention is maybe a sample size cutoff? It&rsquo;s unclear and for all I know &ldquo;filtered for further analysis&rdquo; just means some data points were removed for unspecified reasons.</p>

<p>edit: It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that the Shapiro-Wilk test, like all similar null-hypothesis significance tests, only really are intended to have the outcomes of &ldquo;reject normality&rdquo; and &ldquo;fail to reject normality.&rdquo; They aren&rsquo;t designed so that failing to reject the null is good evidence of normality, it&rsquo;s inadvisable to use it that way.</p>

If a player was 80th percentile TS% for a year, that&rsquo;s his percentile regardless of whether the data were normal or exponential or power law or whatever. You quoted robustness to outliers, interpretability, and ability to translate to percentiles as benefits of your zTS, but me just telling you a player was 85% percentile is more robust to outliers, more interpretable, and easier to translate into a percentile.</p>

<p>The actual disadvantage of saving down the percentiles of every player is parsimony. Using a normal distribution you just need to save down 2 numbers per year, instead of up to 450 numbers per year.</p>

<p>As a side note, you&rsquo;ve alluded to the CLT, this application wants one of the CLTs that doesn&rsquo;t assume the identical part of classical CLT.</p>

I could imagine a CLT argument that the sampled TS% would be normally distributed for each player, but I’m not seeing how you’d get that the TS% distribution of players is normal (i.e. it’s not a distribution of a sample mean or something, even a sample mean with non-iid samples)</p>

<p>As a sanity check (mostly for myself), if inherent player skill just genuinely followed a power law, it would be plausible for TS% to follow a power law right?</p>

      <label for="lecheoi" class="commentText"><p>The sparknotes argument would go:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Any individual player&rsquo;s TS% is by definition, a sample mean. If you don&rsquo;t believe in things such as the hot hand fallacy, then over a large sample the distribution of where that player&rsquo;s individual TS% is for the season will be normally distributed, with mean and SD derived from reading off the binomial approximation.</p></li>

<li><p>If you believe that player TS% is not correlated (which isn&rsquo;t exactly a safe assumption if for example there&rsquo;s a floor raiser that makes everyone on his team shoot better) then now you are taking the mean of a bunch of independent but not identically distributed normals, which is going to be asymptotically normal according to a looser CLT.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of asterisks (e.g. a player&rsquo;s underlying TS can vary across the season in a serially correlated way due a wrist injury or just naturally getting better) that can be sorta handwaved away by a property called &ldquo;strong mixing&rdquo;, which frankly I only learned about for like 1 or 2 lectures like 8 years ago so I&rsquo;m no expert but it basically says even if you have a little serial correlation then you still eventually get asymptotic normality.</p>

<p>More to your specific question, one way to think about it is first to convince yourself that if you average a bunch of [generic distribution stuff], you get something normal. Having inherent player skill be drawn from whatever underlying distribution essentially means a player TS% follows hierarchical model, with you first drawing a mean and then the TS% is conditionally normally distributed around that mean. The end distribution for this TS% can still be called a [generic distribution stuff], so asymptotic normality still applies.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lXFKTrG.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/lXFKTrG.png</a></p>

<p>I slapped together a quick demo, player underlying shooting is drawn from the triangle in the top right so a lopsided distribution, if you simulate 1000 seasons the lopsided distribution is not discernible in the final distribution of average TS%.</p>

<p>Side note: power law distribution we would almost get into trouble since one immutable condition of CLT is finite mean, but since we have to translate player skill into a TS% which is [0,1] then we are ok.</p>

      <label for="lee44go" class="commentText"><p>Thanks I appreciate the comprehensive response! I agree that the mean TS% in a given year can be argued to be normally distributed by CLT arguments with somewhat plausible modeling assumptions, but is that the claim OP is making?</p>

<p>It seems to me that OP’s normality claim is that the distribution of TS% (i.e., the triangular distribution you’ve used in your simulation) is normal, right? That’s the motivation for using z-scores, isn’t it? It’s this distribution where I can’t see any sort of CLT argument, although I totally agree that sampled summary statistics of this distribution will prob be asymptotically normal</p>

<p>Edit: also you probably arrived at the same conclusion, but I’m a bit less confused why OP introduced the Z-scores now; I think their idea is that with sample quantiles, you can’t really compare (e.g.) the best players from different years, since your measure tops out at “the best this year”, whereas if you can fit the underlying distributions for each season, you can start making these comparisons. I’m very skeptical of whether this actually works here though, the underlying normality assumption seems very strong, especially without knowing what OP is doing for outlier removal and what sorts of player-level sample size cuts they’re making.</p>

<p>I’d be interested to see the histograms and details about the normality test (i.e. even if it’s actually normal, it would be surprising if the test fails to reject normality for all 30+ seasons unless α is chosen to be like percent level, but then I’m really not convinced that this test has enough power to detect meaningful deviations from normality).</p>

      <label for="lebfhpj" class="commentText"><p>You write in a couple of places that z-scores are more robust to outliers than other methods that measure relative to mean and standard deviation, but that&rsquo;s not true. z-scores are defined relative to straightforward calculations of population or sample means and standard deviations, without any adjustments for outliers. For instance, z-scores for TS% in a given season would be centered around the mean TS% in that season, same as for rTS% or any other method that computes the mean.</p>

<p>Your method does seem to take outliers into account in a way that other measures might not, since you exclude data from players in the bottom 10% in terms of possessions played. But that has nothing to do with z-scores per se. Any other method, such as rTS%, could be adjusted to do something similar.</p>

      <label for="lebh5ke" class="commentText"><p>Thank you for your observation. You are correct that z-scores are based on straightforward calculations of population or sample means and standard deviations, and these can be influenced by outliers. However, in this particular case, z-scores are transformed back into percentiles based on the normal quantiles, hence, they can offer a more nuanced view of the data distribution which mitigates the perception of outliers.</p>

<p>Firstly, z-score transformations to percentiles map each data point onto a standard normal distribution. This transformation tells us more about the relative standing of each player within the season. This transformation, where extreme values (which might be seen as outliers in raw form) are contextualized within the broader context of the season, makes it easier to see how they compare to the rest of the data.</p>

<p>Secondly, percentiles are inherently robust to outliers because they rank the data rather than measuring absolute distances from the mean. This ranking system reduces the influence that extreme values can have on the mean and standard deviation. In this way, the impact of outliers is largely reduced, and the overall distribution is presented in a manner that highlights relative positions rather than absolute deviations.</p>

I took the average of the bottom 30 players this past season by minutes per game (ignoring the ones that didn&rsquo;t even attempt a shot) and the average was 47.1% which is 0.3% lower than the league average.</p>

      <label for="led05kf" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s probably more useful to just do volume &amp; efficiency. Shot difficulty doesn&rsquo;t matter &ndash; Kobe being really good at taking bad shots (say 40% on triple teamed midrangers) is worse than a teammate being bad at taking a good shot (say 30% on an open kickout 3). The former has a PPP of 0.8, the latter 0.9. Though technically Kobe would get fouled so that 0.8 should be higher, but I&rsquo;m just making a point here. You don&rsquo;t get bonus points for difficulty.</p>

<p>This analysis makes it clear why Kobe was an all-time offensive player: he attracted a lot of attention, shot a lot, and scored at great if not elite efficiencies. Offenses all fail to create good shots and require bailout shots* &ndash; Kobe was historically great on these (side note: that&rsquo;s where the 2016 Warriors failed and the value add of KD). And his turnover rate was extremely low given all of this. The defensive attention meant easier shots for his teammates and better offensive rebounding opportunities (&ldquo;the Kobe assist&rdquo;). This is largely why the 34-48 &lsquo;04-&lsquo;05 post-Shaq Lakers had the #7 offense in the league, and the 45-37 &amp; 42-40 Kwame-era Lakers had the #8 and #7 offense as well. (Defense was the problem of those teams.)</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s why he won a lot of rings.</p>

<p>* Side note on this: one of my biggest criticisms of prime Harden, beyond the foul hunting, was how he &ldquo;gamed&rdquo; the way stats are counted. In his prime, despite being one of the apex isolation players in the league, he would pass the ball with the shot clock ticking down to a teammate all the time. It&rsquo;s optimal from a stat perspective: if your teammate makes the shot, you get an assist. If he misses, he gets the miss. In contrast, if you make the shot, you get points, but if you miss, you get the miss. Harden realized that if his TS% is 60% and he has a 30% shot at making the bailout stepback 3, that is only 45% TS% and it&rsquo;ll drag his stats down. But if that&rsquo;s the best shot for his team, then he should be shooting unless there&rsquo;s a good shot for a teammate.</p>

<p>With LeBron&rsquo;s decline, the Lakers have had lots of issues with bad shots when the offense doesn&rsquo;t produce good looks. And so this is an aspect of the NBA I&rsquo;ve really grown to appreciate after taking it for granted with Kobe &ndash; the marginal value of a guy who can get you a good look when the offense breaks down is immense. I saw the value of this in clear display watching Luka in the WCF as well.</p>

<p>This is a box score watcher take, and not even a good one at that. Being able to make difficult shots completely rips opens defenses. Not only that, since you play against better defenses who are also more locked in in the playoffs, players who are able to take and make difficult shots at above average efficiency go up in value massively when it matters most.</p>

<p>You know what I’m more curious? The measures of standard deviation on shot selection, like we know the expected values of dunks and layups and threes, but how about their variance? How do they compare.</p>

<p>Also standard deviations of offensive and defensive ratings of teams just so we can measure not just their averages, but the level of variance of their performances game to game. For example, I think teams that shoot outside are more exposed to variance thus they have tendencies to bust spectacularly in big games compared to teams than have inside scoring threats.</p>

      <label for="ledd5r6" class="commentText"><p>This is awesome! I was just talking to a friend about how z-scores would be a better tool for evaluating GOATs across eras and would love to see it for the advanced metrics like PER, win shares, and so on. The GOAT debate is more emotional than it is data driven (some people just have stronger attachments to some players and that&rsquo;s fine since that&rsquo;s sort of what sports fandom is anyway), but it would still make it easier to argue who is &ldquo;better&rdquo; when there are too many confounding variables to make direct comparisons across positions/eras actually useful. Well done!</p>

      <label for="ledif67" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely love the work, OP, this is really fun to read through.</p>

<p>One of the things that will always be difficult to contextualize in these stats, is difficulty of shot. I think that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a pretty big split between players/coaches and media/fans when it comes to guys like Kobe. He had not only the audacity to take obscenely difficult shots, but also the ability to somehow hit them at a rate that didn&rsquo;t completely tank his &lsquo;efficiency&rsquo; (relative to the league during his era).</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re on the court, and you&rsquo;re playing great defense, and you have help from a teammate or two, and the guy still makes some stupid nonsense shot on you, it feels different than someone coming off a screen and hitting a relatively open jump shot. But on a spreadsheet, at the end of the day, the latter will look better.</p>

      <label for="lebhfzh" class="commentText"><p>Well, I could use more advanced methods and find non-linear combinations several efficiency metrics, convert them back into z-scores and do the same. But, this is simple and intuitive. Parsimony is the heart of statistics, I won&rsquo;t go run UMAPs or Neural networks for simpler statistical designs just to show off.</p>
