      <label for="le7917i" class="commentText"><p>That was a really crazy Finals, man. I remember the Bulls winning those first two in Phoenix, but then the Suns taking it to triple overtime in Game 3 in Chicago and the Suns finally getting a game. Then Barkley had an insane 30 point triple double in Game 4, but it didn&rsquo;t matter because Jordan had 55 points (with 0 three pointers, keep in mind). Then the Suns took Game 5 in Chicago, and in Game 6 Jordan had every single point for the Bulls in the 4th quarter right up until Paxton hit the championship winning three pointer at the end. Definitely an all time classic Finals series.</p>

      <label for="le7b16r" class="commentText"><p>I remember the year before there was widespread debate about who was the best shooting guard in the league between Jordan and Clyde Drexler. Then in Game 1 of the Finals <a href="https://youtu.be/94_j1w-hBHQ?t=26" target="_blank">Jordan just went absolutely crazy</a> and scored 35 points in the first half (still a Finals record), including 6 three pointers, and his infamous shrug after the 6th one went in. Nobody debated it anymore after that lol</p>

      <label for="le7dqh9" class="commentText"><p>I mean…there wasn’t a debate.  Everyone knew Jordan was better by a real margin.  Jordan’s accomplishments already included multiple MVPs, a LOT of scoring titles, DPOY, etc.  He wasn’t just the consensus best shooting guard, there was no debate as to who the best player on Earth was, it was MJ, even then.  Clyde was the consensus second best shooting guard, not even the second best player.  Nobody could even act like Clyde was as good, so the only talking point leading up to the finals was “Clyde is the better 3 point shooter, will that affect the finals?!”  And even to that question MJ took offense and dropped the line “he’s a better 3 point shooter than I choose to be.”  Which is why he dropped a bunch of 3 point bombs in the first game.  Just to let Clyde and the world know that if he wanted he could be a better 3 point shooter by a lot.</p>

      <label for="le7eeaa" class="commentText"><p>I do remember there being plenty of Jordan haters back then who had gone through years of saying he played selfishly and couldn&rsquo;t win a championship scoring all those points, etc. I think the Clyde vs Jordan talk that year was largely those people struggling with that narrative having been proven wrong when the Bulls won that first title. But you know how people are, they don&rsquo;t just admit that they&rsquo;re wrong, and instead will keep the debate going long after it&rsquo;s obvious which side is correct. I 100% do remember people saying they thought Clyde might be better that season, even if I always thought they were nuts. It never <em>should</em> have been a debate, but unfortunately that talk was definitely out there.</p>

      <label for="le7f5k8" class="commentText"><p>Dude…I’m not trying to be argumentative, but there just wasn’t some sizable group that thought Clyde had a better season.  MJ just came off a season where he BULLIED the showtime Lakers in the finals and won finals MVP, scoring title, steal title, 1st team defense, 1st team all nba.  In the season you’re talking about, MJ just won MVP in which Clyde didn’t get serious votes, defense 1st team, all nba first team, scoring champ, AP athlete of the year, sports illustrated sportsperson of the year, and a number of other accolades.  Clyde scored <strong>10 fewer ppg than Jordan the year you’re saying he was in a debate for best sg</strong>.  He was less efficient, he wasn’t on any defensive teams, he was 2nd team all nba.  There just wasn’t any debate.  Anyone who said that was such a wild, weird contrarian I can smell their tinfoil hat burning.</p>
