      <label for="le7917i" class="commentText"><p>That was a really crazy Finals, man. I remember the Bulls winning those first two in Phoenix, but then the Suns taking it to triple overtime in Game 3 in Chicago and the Suns finally getting a game. Then Barkley had an insane 30 point triple double in Game 4, but it didn&rsquo;t matter because Jordan had 55 points (with 0 three pointers, keep in mind). Then the Suns took Game 5 in Chicago, and in Game 6 Jordan had every single point for the Bulls in the 4th quarter right up until Paxton hit the championship winning three pointer at the end. Definitely an all time classic Finals series.</p>

Then in Game 1 of the Finals <a href="https://youtu.be/94_j1w-hBHQ?t=26" target="_blank">Jordan just went absolutely crazy</a> and scored 35 points in the first half (still a Finals record), including 6 three pointers, and his infamous shrug after the 6th one went in.

      <label for="le7dqh9" class="commentText"><p>I mean…there wasn’t a debate.  Everyone knew Jordan was better by a real margin.  Jordan’s accomplishments already included multiple MVPs, a LOT of scoring titles, DPOY, etc.  He wasn’t just the consensus best shooting guard, there was no debate as to who the best player on Earth was, it was MJ, even then.  Clyde was the consensus second best shooting guard, not even the second best player.  Nobody could even act like Clyde was as good, so the only talking point leading up to the finals was “Clyde is the better 3 point shooter, will that affect the finals?!”  And even to that question MJ took offense and dropped the line “he’s a better 3 point shooter than I choose to be.”  Which is why he dropped a bunch of 3 point bombs in the first game.  Just to let Clyde and the world know that if he wanted he could be a better 3 point shooter by a lot.</p>

      <label for="le7ylmy" class="commentText"><p>Kobe’s shot was just as pretty, and just as designed for shooting off the dribble as MJs. High jump, low arc, etc. like kawhi today. But as far as prettiness and accuracy, none of those three apply  without caveats because they were/are taking insanely difficult, off balance shots that by definition can’t be as pretty or accurate. It’s the level of accuracy on shots that most players aren’t allowed to take, the consistency of what the shot looks like after the ball leaves their hands and they’ve hung in the air, turned their shoulders, or begin their release higher that makes their shots beautiful but imo, not in the traditional Klay Thompson jumper fundamental sense. Maybe Like Picasso, they knew the rules and how to successfully break them and made incredible that wasn’t a photorealistic painting</p>

<p>I mean they were relatively the same type of guy, MJ just had a better shot and was more consistent. Kobe did take a lot of hard shots. That he probably should not have taken, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean a whole lot. Jordan also took very hard shots I mean he stamped that fadeaway.</p>

<p>Kobe&rsquo;s end of career was getting nuts though. By that time he was washed beyond belief, way more so than Jordan ever was even coming back at almost 40. Kobe was flirting with 35% average that last year over 50+ games.</p>

<p>*edit and MJs career 3 point percentage was basically league average over his career. Not year by year, but if you average them out. So the arguments of whether he could or could not have been an average 3 point shooter are basically moot. His remarkable mid range shooting, great fundamentals and work ethic, and as time has taught us is one of, if not the, most important indicator for 3 point percentage improvement Mike was always a good FT shooter.</p>

<p>Jordan was a BAD 3 pt shooter until they moved the line in. There is literally nothing to suggest he would develop into a three point shooter simply because he wanted to.</p>

<p>E: career 28% from 3 if you remove the seasons with the shortened line. 40% from three during the years with the short line. This isn’t even a debate guys, he was not a good three point shooter. Y’all just either don’t realize the line was moved in, or like to ignore it so that you can keep pretending he was infallible.</p>

<p>You can easily make the case he’s the greatest without all the extra bullshit</p>

Threes are a not the biggest part of their game and they continued to be successful. There&rsquo;s no reason Jordan wouldn&rsquo;t still dominate while not being a better 3pt shooter.

<p>But people completely lose their head when it comes to MJ. He can do anything! He had a short stretch playing point guard? Well obviously he would have been the best passer ever if he wanted to. He made 6 threes in a game? Nobody ever gets hot, he was just nerfing his inner Steph curry.</p>

<p>Like, he’s arguably the greatest player ever, you don’t need to invent some bullshit about how he would will his way to anything to make that argument.</p>

<p>Jordan would be a fuck of a lot better as a baseball player if “will” and wanting it bad enough simply allowed you to excel at everything.</p>

      <label for="le8aeiv" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, they completely ignore the fact that he was statistically as good the year he lost to the magic as he was in other years he won the title.</p>

<p>They needed a PF, the hole was filled and they got back on track. It wasn’t Jordan suddenly being a different guy, their team made significant improvements around him and that same level of play was enough to win with the right players around him.</p>

<p>Great marketing I guess. As I said, there is a real case to be made for him. I don’t know why everybody insists on propping shit up extra.</p>

<p>This game in particular for some reason allows people to run wild with the idea of Jordan being a knock down shooter. It would be like if we picked out Shaqs very best free throw shooting game to suggest he could have shot 80+% from the line if he decided to. It’s silly. They are both still great players, why do we have to pretend anything?</p>

But you know how people are, they don&rsquo;t just admit that they&rsquo;re wrong, and instead will keep the debate going long after it&rsquo;s obvious which side is correct. I 100% do remember people saying they thought Clyde might be better that season, even if I always thought they were nuts. It never <em>should</em> have been a debate, but unfortunately that talk was definitely out there.</p>

MJ just came off a season where he BULLIED the showtime Lakers in the finals and won finals MVP, scoring title, steal title, 1st team defense, 1st team all nba.  In the season you’re talking about, MJ just won MVP in which Clyde didn’t get serious votes, defense 1st team, all nba first team, scoring champ, AP athlete of the year, sports illustrated sportsperson of the year, and a number of other accolades.  Clyde scored <strong>10 fewer ppg than Jordan the year you’re saying he was in a debate for best sg</strong>.  He was less efficient, he wasn’t on any defensive teams, he was 2nd team all nba.  There just wasn’t any debate.  Anyone who said that was such a wild, weird contrarian I can smell their tinfoil hat burning.</p>

<p>I remember the year before there was widespread debate about who was the best shooting guard in the league between Jordan and Clyde Drexler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hell there was.</p>

<p>There was a marketing attempt by NBC to put Drexler on the level of Jordan when the Blazers were a championship quality team. But Drexler was never presented as <em>better</em> than Jordan.</p>

<p>Mind you, Karl Malone and Dominique Wilkins were scoring close to a Jordan level, but they weren’t marketed at a high level by NBC because the Jazz and Hawks weren’t close to making the finals.</p>

      <label for="le88oxl" class="commentText"><p>Maybe that’s how it used to be.  Now Montverde Academy exists and lately their teams have had 3+ future NBA players on it.</p>

<p>Like their 2020 team went undefeated and won the HS National Championship.  It had Cade Cunningham, Scottie Barnes, Moses Moodey, Day’Ron Sharpe, and Caleb Houston on it.  It’s insane that a HS team had 5 future NBA players on it.</p>

<p>Other former alumni include Joel Embiid, D’Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, RJ Barrett, Andrew Nembhart, Jalen Duren, Cooper Flagg.  The program is insane.</p>

      <label for="le7x8n3" class="commentText"><p>Imagine coming to the realization / belief that MJ is the one guy on the planet better than you, only for him to immediately retire, and what you get in his place is two years of prime Hakeem. Without those two guys overlapping with Charles&rsquo; entire career, there&rsquo;s very little doubt in my mind that he gets at least one ring. Makes me sad that the younger generation sees him mostly as a commentator who never won anything, instead of the absolute beast that he was.</p>

      <label for="le7kz4s" class="commentText"><p>Barkley has such weird mentality. Bruh if you weren’t the worst defensive pf in the league maybe your team would’ve won . It was Barkleys defence that hurt them , but this man that criticises modern players never played D n had zero defensive awareness</p>

<p>Edit : I just checked and Barkley was voted by gms n scouts n players etc as the worst defensive player in the league , he was also voted n considered one of the worst defenders ever . Wasn’t just his height Barkley said he gets paid to rebound n score and he needs another million dollars to defend. Bozos downvoting cos pointing out Barkley flaws doesn’t make this story look the way they want. If Barkley wasn’t literally rookie trae young- but worse then trae considering pf importance on defence then he’d have a ring MJ or not .</p>
