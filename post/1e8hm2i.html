      <label for="le7917i" class="commentText"><p>That was a really crazy Finals, man. I remember the Bulls winning those first two in Phoenix, but then the Suns taking it to triple overtime in Game 3 in Chicago and the Suns finally getting a game. Then Barkley had an insane 30 point triple double in Game 4, but it didn&rsquo;t matter because Jordan had 55 points (with 0 three pointers, keep in mind). Then the Suns took Game 5 in Chicago, and in Game 6 Jordan had every single point for the Bulls in the 4th quarter right up until Paxton hit the championship winning three pointer at the end. Definitely an all time classic Finals series.</p>

Then in Game 1 of the Finals <a href="https://youtu.be/94_j1w-hBHQ?t=26" target="_blank">Jordan just went absolutely crazy</a> and scored 35 points in the first half (still a Finals record), including 6 three pointers, and his infamous shrug after the 6th one went in. Nobody debated it anymore after that lol</p>

      <label for="le7dqh9" class="commentText"><p>I mean…there wasn’t a debate.  Everyone knew Jordan was better by a real margin.  Jordan’s accomplishments already included multiple MVPs, a LOT of scoring titles, DPOY, etc.  He wasn’t just the consensus best shooting guard, there was no debate as to who the best player on Earth was, it was MJ, even then.  Clyde was the consensus second best shooting guard, not even the second best player.  Nobody could even act like Clyde was as good, so the only talking point leading up to the finals was “Clyde is the better 3 point shooter, will that affect the finals?!”  And even to that question MJ took offense and dropped the line “he’s a better 3 point shooter than I choose to be.”  Which is why he dropped a bunch of 3 point bombs in the first game.  Just to let Clyde and the world know that if he wanted he could be a better 3 point shooter by a lot.</p>

<p>Even between those two you have 5% between their lifetime FG%. That&rsquo;s a shitload for the type of player they are.</p>

      <label for="le7ylmy" class="commentText"><p>Kobe’s shot was just as pretty, and just as designed for shooting off the dribble as MJs. High jump, low arc, etc. like kawhi today. But as far as prettiness and accuracy, none of those three apply  without caveats because they were/are taking insanely difficult, off balance shots that by definition can’t be as pretty or accurate. It’s the level of accuracy on shots that most players aren’t allowed to take, the consistency of what the shot looks like after the ball leaves their hands and they’ve hung in the air, turned their shoulders, or begin their release higher that makes their shots beautiful but imo, not in the traditional Klay Thompson jumper fundamental sense. Maybe Like Picasso, they knew the rules and how to successfully break them and made incredible that wasn’t a photorealistic painting</p>

      <label for="le80h73" class="commentText"><p>MJ is a lifetime 50% shooter. Kobe is at 45%. It&rsquo;s not even close.</p>

<p>I mean they were relatively the same type of guy, MJ just had a better shot and was more consistent. Kobe did take a lot of hard shots. That he probably should not have taken, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean a whole lot. Jordan also took very hard shots I mean he stamped that fadeaway.</p>

<p>Kobe&rsquo;s end of career was getting nuts though. By that time he was washed beyond belief, way more so than Jordan ever was even coming back at almost 40. Kobe was flirting with 35% average that last year over 50+ games.</p>

      <label for="le7eeaa" class="commentText"><p>I do remember there being plenty of Jordan haters back then who had gone through years of saying he played selfishly and couldn&rsquo;t win a championship scoring all those points, etc. I think the Clyde vs Jordan talk that year was largely those people struggling with that narrative having been proven wrong when the Bulls won that first title. But you know how people are, they don&rsquo;t just admit that they&rsquo;re wrong, and instead will keep the debate going long after it&rsquo;s obvious which side is correct. I 100% do remember people saying they thought Clyde might be better that season, even if I always thought they were nuts. It never <em>should</em> have been a debate, but unfortunately that talk was definitely out there.</p>

      <label for="le7f5k8" class="commentText"><p>Dude…I’m not trying to be argumentative, but there just wasn’t some sizable group that thought Clyde had a better season.  MJ just came off a season where he BULLIED the showtime Lakers in the finals and won finals MVP, scoring title, steal title, 1st team defense, 1st team all nba.  In the season you’re talking about, MJ just won MVP in which Clyde didn’t get serious votes, defense 1st team, all nba first team, scoring champ, AP athlete of the year, sports illustrated sportsperson of the year, and a number of other accolades.  Clyde scored <strong>10 fewer ppg than Jordan the year you’re saying he was in a debate for best sg</strong>.  He was less efficient, he wasn’t on any defensive teams, he was 2nd team all nba.  There just wasn’t any debate.  Anyone who said that was such a wild, weird contrarian I can smell their tinfoil hat burning.</p>

<p>The hell there was.</p>

<p>There was a marketing attempt by NBC to put Drexler on the level of Jordan when the Blazers were a championship quality team. But Drexler was never presented as <em>better</em> than Jordan.</p>

<p>Mind you, Karl Malone and Dominique Wilkins were scoring close to a Jordan level, but they weren’t marketed at a high level by NBC because the Jazz and Hawks weren’t close to making the finals.</p>

      <label for="le7x8n3" class="commentText"><p>Imagine coming to the realization / belief that MJ is the one guy on the planet better than you, only for him to immediately retire, and what you get in his place is two years of prime Hakeem. Without those two guys overlapping with Charles&rsquo; entire career, there&rsquo;s very little doubt in my mind that he gets at least one ring. Makes me sad that the younger generation sees him mostly as a commentator who never won anything, instead of the absolute beast that he was.</p>

      <label for="le7kz4s" class="commentText"><p>Barkley has such weird mentality. Bruh if you weren’t the worst defensive pf in the league maybe your team would’ve won . It was Barkleys defence that hurt them , but this man that criticises modern players never played D n had zero defensive awareness</p>

<p>Edit : I just checked and Barkley was voted by gms n scouts n players etc as the worst defensive player in the league , he was also voted n considered one of the worst defenders ever . Wasn’t just his height Barkley said he gets paid to rebound n score and he needs another million dollars to defend. Bozos downvoting cos pointing out Barkley flaws doesn’t make this story look the way they want. If Barkley wasn’t literally rookie trae young- but worse then trae considering pf importance on defence then he’d have a ring MJ or not .</p>

      <label for="le7p015" class="commentText"><p>You aren&rsquo;t really wrong, but saying he would have a ring because he played better defense is fucking absurd lol. That isn&rsquo;t going to stop Jordan for sure in this era. It might stop Horace Grant?</p>
