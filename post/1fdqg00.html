    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Just saw some highlights from Hou vs GSW. I wanted to ask y’all’s opinion on if Harden was ever “better” than KD.
Harden did some seriously new things with his offense and Dantoni, and I’m beginning to see more and more players talk about his impact (on podcasts and such). Everybody knows about KD being Kevin Durant, you know who he is.
But just wanted to ask, since a lot of people discount Durant’s GSW rings and such, is there ever a scenario that you have Harden over KD ?</p>

<p>Like, KD had Steph, Draymond, Klay beside him. Those are 3 active allstars. One is an MVP caliber player, one is an All NBA DPOY, the other is an all NBA allstar.</p>

<p>Harden had a good CP3 one year and a pretty washed CP3 the next year, he was never an active allstar though. Not all NBA. None of it.</p>

<p>And Harden almost beat them in 2018 and was cooking in 2019.</p>

<p>Those 2 years, if you were to switch them teams.. Harden is sweeping KD</p>

<p>In pretty much any year over the last 10 years where the Celtics have been pretty talented, then yeah, gimme KD.</p>

<p>But, if I just needed to win games in the aftermath of trading the Big 3 away in 2013 and I have a roster full of guys who should really probably be in the G-league, then gimme Harden.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not wrong though that Russ is absolutely a better heliocentric type of player than KD &amp; Steph and there&rsquo;s merits to having that type of player when you have a team like OKC did in 2017 after KD left which was very light on shot creation.</p>

      <label for="lmhvofj" class="commentText"><p>Why does that matter at all?</p>

<p>The Warriors do not get anywhere near as worse as the Rockets would if you made the swap of KD and Harden.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re clinging on to some point about the difference in fit, but the summary is like</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Harden took the Warriors 7 games when KD had an ACTIVE top 15 MVP, an All NBA/allstar, and a DPOY/allstar teammate while Harden had an older CP3.</p></li>

<li><p>In 2019, Harden put up a better offensive series than KD despite CP3 being significantly worse due to injury while KD had the exact same accolades among his teammates.</p></li>

<li><p>The Rockets with KD absolutely lose to the Warriors with Harden in a swap</p></li>

<li><p>The idea that Harden wouldn&rsquo;t allow other allstars to shine in a situation where there&rsquo;s so many of them on one team is dispeoven by him on the Nets, where he had Kyrie and KD putting up some of their best seasons ever HIS FIRST TIME PLAYING WITH JUST 2 ALLSTAR TEAMMATES, LET ALONE THE 3 KD HAD BEFORE, off of his playmaking while also feeding roleplayers and carrying the team when KD was out.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There is absolutely no world where it&rsquo;s more of a struggle to have a 4 allstar squad than a 1 allstar squad. Stop doing this shit lmao</p>

<ol>
<li>Harden had better seasonal accolades and counting stats both years.</li>
</ol>

<p>but you cling to one small delusion about fit lol. Everything logical suggests Harden was better.</p>

<p>Harden is a ball centric player that dribbles the air out of the ball. that was my reasoning.</p>

<p>in addition he doesn&rsquo;t play def.</p>

<p>KD would bring more of a def impact than Harden would. Just in terms of rim protection and not being a traffic cone on def.</p>

KD isnt that much older than him, and is better than harden now. so other than those years hes been above him.</p>

<p>even with the MVP season, it was lebron, KD and steph as the 3 best players in the world. until harden proves it in the playoffs, its hard to take him above those guys</p>

<p>There’s not a single time Harden was ever the best player on a team KD was on. You can say harden was having a MVP stretch with the nets but KD was injured during that time period. You could say Harden had a better series than KD against the Celtics but that’s like saying Kobe had a better series than Shaq in the playoffs in 2001 as a way of trying to say Kobe was better lol. The season when Kyrie was sitting out due to the vaccine, KD was still the better player than Harden</p>

<p>Right now and when harden first landed in Houston, KD is/ was still the better player. Remove the two titles this still isn’t a conversation.</p>

      <label for="lmht2z2" class="commentText"><p>They played at his methodical pace and ran his offense, the team was built around <em>him</em> and catered to his strengths, that&rsquo;s where Bruce Brown made his career and Blake had a brief renaissance.</p>

<p>That to me is what a bus driver is, who is the team built around and whose image does the team reflect.</p>

<p>KD is only <em>that</em> level of player when he has an MVP level PG to generate the rim pressure and make plays for others that he can&rsquo;t, his success without one is poor to say the least.</p>

      <label for="lmhu242" class="commentText"><p>Well for starters. Most of that team with the exception of Blake griffin were there before harden was traded from Houston. So technically they weren’t <em>built</em> around him.</p>

<p>Secondly, he’s was and still is best playmaker of that big 3, so of course they were going to play at his pace. You trying to say “bus driver” in a way of implying harden was better is disingenuous and you know it.</p>

<p>Lastly, KD is a traditional forward. <em>most</em> traditional forwards need a PG who plays at a high level which is one of the reasons the point forward and eventually point Center became such a thing IE Lebron, Luka, Jokic etc. KD is not a playmaker and that’s not his role.</p>

<p>None of this takes away from my point either. KD throughout his career was always better than Harden. You provided not one example stating otherwise except Harden was a point guard(bus driver)  for the Nets….which we all knew.</p>

      <label for="lmhx8ta" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think this consensus KD &amp;gt; Harden opinion exists if KD never goes to GS and they each have 0 rings, but I digress, that&rsquo;s a discussion for another day.</p>

<p>Agree to disagree, I value Harden&rsquo;s playmaking significantly more than you do, and whilst I get that&rsquo;s not KD&rsquo;s role, it still matters when comparing their value as players, and to me, the most important thing a player can do offensively is be the primary initiator and engine of a team&rsquo;s offense and KD has never shown the ability to do that.</p>

<p>Now KD is probably the greatest ceiling raiser in NBA history because his game fits flawlessly with everybody and anybody, but fundamentally the gap between their playmaking is quite a bit larger than the gap between KD and Harden as scorers. If KD was actually a really good defensive player instead of just trying hard for the last 5 minutes of the 4th Q, then that would be enough to give him a sizable edge, but without that, I don&rsquo;t see that much difference in terms of their overall impact on a team&rsquo;s ability to win.</p>

<p>Simple question, I give you the following four players to surround either Harden or KD with, who do you think elevates this group more?</p>

<p>Guard: Derrick White</p>

<p>Guard/Wing: Jrue Holiday</p>

<p>Wing: OG Anunoby</p>

<p>C: Dereck Lively II</p>

      <label for="lmhqlwq" class="commentText"><p>Depends on the team. KD can fit into nearly any system seamlessly although people forget how many isos or just pull-ups he took on the Warriors he didn&rsquo;t turn into Curry. He&rsquo;s also a 7-footer who is mobile and has decent rim protection although his defense was shakey in his earlier years.</p>

<p>But a decent team where you just throw Harden or KD and give them a decent supporting cast? I think Prime Harden is better than Prime KD and would take him. During the regular season, Harden is a higher volume scorer with slightly less efficiency (although still elite). But the playmaking gap is just night and day. KD is an okay to good playmaker who can give you 5-6 assists on 3 TOV and Prime Harden is an all time great play maker who can give you 8-11 on 3 TOV.</p>

<p>In the Playoffs KD&rsquo;s scoring actually goes up and Harden&rsquo;s goes slightly down. But Harden still is the way better and more reliable playmaker and was an underrated defender during some of his later Houston years in the PO.</p>
