</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Last week <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1erb13z/alltime_single_position_teams/" target="_blank">I made a post</a> asking &ldquo;How do you make an all-time starting 5 out of power forwards?&rdquo;, and here are my results based on the comments (team posted about halfway down). This team is not definitive; it is just the one I constructed</p>

<p>#The rules:</p>

<p>All 5 players historically played the same position, and you have to attempt to make a complete team. This is based on the strict majority of seasons listed on basketball reference, so Lebron and KD don&rsquo;t count as PFs <em>with the exception of Tim Duncan who I am counting as a PF because his prime was at that position</em>. This isn&rsquo;t just a top 5 PF post; there&rsquo;s gotta be a PF hypothetically played at point guard and at center here. I didn&rsquo;t explicitly say it in the original post, but all 5 teams would play each other.</p>

<p>#Powering Forward</p>

<p>Over the history of the NBA power forwards have ranged from a secondary big man banging in the post and pulling down boards to modern versatile wings that pass and shoot from the perimeter as well. A team of PFs would eat up everything inside the arc on offense and defense.</p>

<p>My main issue building this team is ball handling. It&rsquo;s easy to find players for the front court, and there have been enough stretch-4 guys to have shooters. But it&rsquo;s tough to find someone to dribble the ball up and be the primary facilitator. While that&rsquo;s the big missing piece, the team needs to prioritize foot speed. In this hypothetical where they would be playing teams of guards or SFs, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to get blown by every time. I&rsquo;m trying to make a team of switchable 4s that are versatile enough to keep the ball moving on offense too.</p>

<p>#My team</p>

<p>PG - Draymond Green</p>

<p>SG - Dirk Nowitzki</p>

<p>SF - Kevin Garnett</p>

<p>PF - Giannis Antetokounmpo</p>

<p>C - Tim Duncan</p>

<p>Bench: Bob Pettit, Chris Webber, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, Dennis Rodman</p>

<p>4 MVPs starting, 3 on the bench, and 3 DPOYs between them too. It was really easy to put Dirk at SG and Timmy at C. Dirk was known for his shooting and stretching the floor. He was a prolific scorer with guard skills and a high release point that was nearly unblockable. TD played as a classic big man with a mid range shot, often next to a traditional center in his prime, later transitioning to the primary center for the Spurs. I had trouble with the PG spot, but Draymond is an amazing passer and floor general. He&rsquo;s averaged about 8 assists per game for a season, and he&rsquo;s also shot 38% from 3 before (for 1 season&hellip;). KG is one of the greatest PFs of all time, a willing passer, and one of the few criticisms leveled at him was that he probably preferred shooting over post ups/print to the rim too much. This makes him a great 3, where his combination of physicality and long 2s suit the positional need. Finally the 4 of 4s, Giannis can&rsquo;t shoot, but he will get to the rim. Capable of kicking it out and keeping the ball moving, he&rsquo;s a great addition for athleticism and per to this starting lineup. And then, holy hell, this is a nasty defensive lineup. If you can get by Dray/Giannis/KG, you have TD waiting at the rim. And if you pull Timmy out of the paint, anyone else can cover that spot no trouble.</p>

<p>The bench is an island of misfit toys, but I think it could work. Malone and CWebb can space the floor a tiny bit, with Barkley able to provide a little space as well. Dennis Rodman is the only defense-first guy off the bench, but he&rsquo;s also one of the greatest ever in that category. In transition, Barkley and Rodman are getting every point, and then every board in the world gets pulled down by this bench. Bob Pettit was the first dominant PF the NBA saw, and the 2x MVP was the only person to interrupt the Celtics&rsquo; winning streak with Russell.</p>

<p>#Omissions</p>

<p>There were some tough ones. Thinking of post-up PFs, I immediately think of Kevin McHale. Blake Griffin was explosive and powerful early on, and then he transitioned to a shooter and leader in the latter half of his career. Lamarcus Aldridge was a consistent all-star and All-NBA selection, and I really considered him. Gasol, Bosh, and KLove are all modern guys that I didn&rsquo;t find a spot for, but they definitely could have been on there. I wanted to put Ralph Sampson on here, but his career just doesn&rsquo;t match up with most of these guys. Odom has an interesting skillset. AD is <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> between PF and C on bball-ref, so I could have put him here. Older guys like Elvin Hayes, Jerry Lucas, and Dave DeBusschere I just don&rsquo;t know enough about.</p>

<p>Who makes your team?</p>

      <label for="lk6diky" class="commentText"><p>Gimme Boris Diaw at PG.</p>

<p>He is not on the same class as the other players you listed, but I think he might be the best point guard of the bunch and his style would complement very well the other stars PF with a high usage on the roster.</p>

<p>One of the few players who actually played all five positions during his career, a brilliant basketball player.</p>
