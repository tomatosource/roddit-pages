      <p>Here is my 32-team NBA plan with realignment and modifications to the schedule, in-season tournament, All-Star Game Format, and postseason (Play-In and Playoffs).</p>

<p><strong>REALIGNMENT:</strong></p>

<p>To make scheduling easier, each of the 2 conferences would have 4 divisions with 4 teams in each division. The following realignment would require the least amount of travel (Mileage Calculated By Computer).</p>

<p><strong>REGULAR SEASON SCHEDULE:</strong></p>

<p><strong>4 games each vs. all 3 division opponents = 12 games</strong></p>

<p>(2 Home &amp; 2 Away vs. each team)</p>

<p><strong>3 games each vs. all 12 non-division opponents within conference = 36 games</strong></p>

<p>(2 Home &amp; 1 Away vs. each of 6 teams [2 from each division])</p>

<p>(1 Home &amp; 2 Away vs. each of 6 teams [2 from each division])</p>

<p>Extra home game between teams would rotate each season.</p>

<p><strong>2 games each vs. all 16 non-conference opponents = 32 games</strong></p>

<p>(1 Home &amp; 1 Away vs. each team)</p>

<p><strong>12 games + 36 games + 32 games = 80 preliminary regular season games</strong></p>

<p>1 additional game each vs. 2 non-divisional opponents within conference TBD based on how the in-season tournament plays out = 2 games</p>

<p><strong>80 games + 2 games = 82-game regular season</strong></p>

<p><strong>NEW IN-SEASON TOURNAMENT FORMAT:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cup Games:</strong></p>

<p>Divisions would serve as groups for the in-season tournament. Teams would play 6 cup games per season in group play. Each teamâ€™s 1st regular season home game and 1st regular season away game vs. each of its 3 division opponents would be counted as cup games. Cup games would only take place on designated cup nights which would be every Tuesday and Friday from a timespan from the 1st week in November up until about the week before Christmas. Designated cup nights would consist exclusively of cup games.</p>

<p><strong>Qualifying Teams for Knockout-Round:</strong></p>

<p>8 total teams would qualify for the single-elimination knockout round of the tournament. The team in each division with the best standing in cup games would qualify for the single-elimination knockout round of the tournament. Qualifying teams would be ranked #1-#4 within respective conferences based on standing in cup games.</p>

<p>The 24 teams that don&rsquo;t qualify for the knockout round would play 2 additional regular season games (discussed later).</p>

<p><strong>Tiebreakers implemented as applicable:</strong></p>

<p>First, the head-to-head record between teams in cup games. Second, the point differential in head-to-head between teams in cup games. Third, the overall point differential in cup games. Fourth, the previous season regular season records.</p>

<p><strong>Knockout Round Format:</strong></p>

<p>The Quarterfinals of the knockout round would feature (#1 vs. #4) and (#2 vs. #3) in each conference. The 4 Quarterfinals would all take place on <strong>Christmas Day (Dec. 25th)</strong> in <strong>Louisville, KY</strong> split 2 and 2 between <strong>KFC Yum Center</strong> and <strong>Freedom Hall</strong>. The winners of the Quarterfinals in each conference would play each other in the Semifinals 3 days later <strong>(Dec. 28th)</strong> at <strong>T-Mobile Center</strong> in <strong>Kansas City, MO</strong>. The losers in each conference would face each other in a regular season game at the venue where they were originally scheduled to play only once in the preliminary regular season schedule on either Dec. 29th or Dec. 30th. The Semifinals winners from each conference would face off in the In-Season Cup Championship on New Year&rsquo;s Eve <strong>(Dec. 31st)</strong> also at <strong>T-Mobile Center</strong> in <strong>Kansas City, MO</strong>.</p>

<p>Games played in the Quarterfinals and Semifinals would count toward the regular season. However, the Cup Championship would <strong>NOT</strong> count toward the regular season.</p>

<p><strong>In-Season Tournament Awards:</strong></p>

<p>The team that wins the In-Season Championship would receive the cup, a <span class="math inline">\(1 million bonus for each of its players and coaches for the season and also would hold any tiebreaker in the standings at the end of the regular season. The runner-up team's players and coaches would each receive a \)</span>250k bonus for the season. The players and coaches of the 2 teams that lose in the semifinals of the tournament would receive a <span class="math inline">\(125k bonus for the season. The players and coaches of the 4 teams that lose in the quarterfinals of the tournament would receive a \)</span>50k bonus for the season.</p>

<p><strong>Teams That Failed To Qualify For Knockout Round:</strong></p>

<p>The 24 teams that fail to qualify for the knockout round of the in-season tournament would each be assigned 2 additional regular season games (1 Home &amp; 1 Away). Here is how they would be decided:</p>

<p>In each division, the 3 teams that don&rsquo;t qualify for the knockout round of the in-season tournament would be ranked #1-#3 within respective division based on their regular season records the previous season. Each team then would play 2 of its non-divisional conference opponents with a similar ranking (1 vs. 1â€™s, 2 vs. 2â€™s, 3 vs. 3â€™s). Teams would play one of these games on either Dec. 26th or Dec 27th and the other one on either Dec. 29th or Dec. 30th. The assigned divisions which the 2 opponents come from would rotate on a yearly basis. Teams would each play one of these opponents at home and the other away (Accounting for home &amp; away, assigned division rotations would have a 6-year cycle.) See link below for how the 6-year cycle would work:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/a9l3G8M" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/a9l3G8M</a></p>

<p><strong>NEW ALL-STAR GAME FORMAT:</strong></p>

<p>For the All-Star Game, the East vs. West format would be used. However, each individual player selected for the All-Star Game would chose a charity of their choice which they would like to donate money too. Each player on the winning team would get $500k which would go to their selected charity. The players on the losing team would walk away empty-handed. The winning charities donated to canâ€™t be recycled. Instead of the normal 4-quarter game, the All-Star game would be like a pick-up game where first team to 100 wins. Dead ball substitutions would be allowed and each team would be allowed 10 timeouts each throughout the game.</p>

<p><strong>NEW PLAY-IN &amp; PLAYOFF FORMAT:</strong></p>

<p>In each conference, the 4 division winners along with the next 6 best regular season records would be seeded #1-#10 strictly by regular season record within respective conference. This would mean that a non-division winner could be seeded higher than a division-winner.</p>

<p>The #1-#6 seeded teams in each conference would qualify for the playoffs and advance straight to the First Round. The #7-#10 seeded teams in each conference would have to participate in the play-in round to determine the final 2 playoff spots in each conference.</p>

<p><strong>The Play-In Tournament:</strong></p>

<p>For the first games of the play-in tournament in each conference, (#7 seed would host #8 seed) and (#9 seed would host #10 seed). The winner of the #7 vs. #8 game would qualify for the playoffs and be seeded #7 in respective conference for the First Round. The loser of the #9 vs. #10 game would be eliminated from playoff contention. For the last game of the play-in tournament in each conference, the loser of the #7 vs. #8 game would host the winner of the #9 vs. #10 game. The winner of that game would qualify for the playoffs and be seeded #8 in respective conference for the First Round. The loser would be eliminated from playoff contention.</p>

<p><strong>THE PLAYOFFS:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Eastern Conference First Round &amp; Western Conference First Round:</strong></p>

<p>Would be (#1 Seed vs. #8 Seed), (#2 Seed vs. #7 Seed), (#3 Seed vs. #6 Seed) and (#4 Seed vs. #5 Seed).</p>

<p>Best-of-7 series (2-2-1-1-1 format). Higher seed would get home-court advantage.</p>

<p><strong>Eastern Conference Semifinals &amp; Western Conference Semifinals:</strong></p>

<p>Would be (#1/#8 Seed vs. #4/#5 Seed) and (#2/#7 Seed vs. #3/#6 Seed).</p>

<p>Best-of-7 series (2-2-1-1-1 format). Higher seed would get home-court advantage.</p>

<p><strong>Eastern Conference Finals &amp; Western Conference Finals:</strong></p>

<p>Would be the 2 surviving teams vs. each other for Conference Championships.</p>

<p>Best-of-7 series (2-2-1-1-1 format). Higher seed would get home-court advantage.</p>

<p><strong>NBA Finals:</strong></p>

<p>The 2 Conference Champions would square off for the NBA Championship.</p>

<p>Best-of-7 series (2-2-1-1-1 format). Better regular season record would get home-court advantage.</p>

      <label for="l9vurj0" class="commentText"><p>You clearly you did not actually look this up before commenting. DC is closer to Toronto. Yes it is more south than NY or Boston but those two are much further out East. Flight time wise DC to Toronto is 1hr25min. NY to Toronto is 1hr35min. Boston to Toronto is 1hr50min.</p>
