      <label for="l8fh0kf" class="commentText"><p>Luka is 95% of the reason the Mavs are even in this position. But it’s gotta be so frustrating as a Mavs fan. Last night was a 7 point loss and Luka on his own left his team to play 5 v. 4 on defense like <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> times and cost them like 5-8 points. Not even talking about the bad defense, but complaining about bullshit and not even playing defense.</p>

<p>People are saying his defense needs to improve for him to win a ring, I think cutting out complaining and leaving his team out to dry on transition will honestly be good enough to get a Luka team over the hump</p>

<p>I just made a post on the Mavs subreddit about how it’s okay to have both of these opinions but it got taken down in less than 5 minutes. Meanwhile another fan literally went armchair psychiatrist suggesting that Kyrie needs therapy to play better in Boston and not only was it overwhelmingly upvoted but they left it up. Our mods suck.</p>

      <label for="l8gacla" class="commentText"><p>As a Celts fan, the funniest take I keep seeing is that Luka keeps getting cooked on D because he isn&rsquo;t giving it enough effort. Like this man is carrying the entire team on his back offensively, then being targeted on defense 75% of the time. I imagine he is exhausted and he is picking where to spend his energy. How can anyone blame him for not &ldquo;giving it his all&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Having said that, I agree with you. <strong>Emotionally</strong>, he has a ton of room to improve. He wastes so much time complaining which both leaves his team out to dry and brings the vibes down for the Mavs.</p>

<p>Tatum had the non-stop complaining problem until pretty recently he finally has toned it down. Overall, I don&rsquo;t really think Luka should get blamed for getting cooked on D, but I definitely think he can be blamed for the mindset he shows.</p>

<p>he also seems super beat up on top of it. like, playing injured, working through a ton of pain, trying to carry the offensive load <em>and</em> being targeted specifically on defense by a team as offensively varied as the Celtics&hellip; fuck, man, anyone would be pretty frustrated .

      <label for="l8gy229" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. This is such a level-headed perspective. Could/should he be doing better defensively, 100%, and I expect he&rsquo;ll get crushed this offseason over it and deservedly so. But this is so far and away from not being the top reason we&rsquo;re getting beat by Boston. The Celtics are just a much deeper &amp; better team right now. They may not have the best player but the Mavs in 2011 didn&rsquo;t have the best player and they still won.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s injured and worn down and it&rsquo;s really getting exposed on defense but he hasn&rsquo;t exactly been peak Luka offensively this round either. He&rsquo;s way too focused on trying to get fouls called rather than make buckets, but people only want to point out that he&rsquo;s a traffic cone defensively.</p>

<p>Having a secondary ball handler has already helped take some of the offensive burden off Luka, now they just need a couple guys that can consistently knock down the open shots they create.</p>

      <label for="l8fm7ld" class="commentText"><p>I think the complaining is pivotal but he needs to get in shape and be able to last a whole season. He couldn’t defend all series and got hunted relentlessly. Can’t be that big of a liability defensively and only score 27pts on 27 shot attempts in the biggest game of your life.</p>

<p>Not even touching the fact he fouled out which is inexcusable. He’s not mature enough yet to win and hopefully this loss makes him better but he needs to improve mentally, defensively, and physically if he wants to win. That or he needs to hope that the Mavs can build a roster around him that can rival Boston’s and that doesn’t seem likely</p>

      <label for="l8fs4l9" class="commentText"><p>Usually when you see guys complaining this much it&rsquo;s because they know they are overmatched and are looking for any edge. See Draymond the last 3 years&hellip;</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t some random meltdown from Luka, it&rsquo;s calculated and the only way the Mavs had a shot. It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Outside on #1 and #2 the Celts are just a much better team. Luka is banged up. Coaching is in Bostons favor. He doesn&rsquo;t have it and he knows.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s hoping for favors from the refs to bail him out and get a win or too.</p>

      <label for="l8fufqz" class="commentText"><p>Luka always does this, if it was a one and done sure, but he’s notorious for complaining to refs. That doesn’t have anything to do with being “overmatched” he’s just a cry baby and many other great players were early on too. The big 3 Heat whined and bitched so much that Dallas series that they had 3v5 in transition every time because Lebron and Wade would cry to refs.</p>

<p>Stars go through this shit all the time, now he needs to put in the work like the other greats did and get better</p>

<p>He would shoulder check/move Ant,  NAW, slow mo out the way then the next possession, have to gather his steps, be stuck and then fish flop around Mike Conley for shooting fouls, then quickly tell the team he&rsquo;s okay and shoot his FTs.</p>

<p>Also that final stretch Before the blocking foul was crazy.</p>

<p>The refs were holding their whistles on both sides and the bumps and fouls were getting hard around Tatum, Brown, Kyrie and Luka.</p>

      <label for="l8hdpdc" class="commentText"><p>I think we should expect some regression to the mean next season for Dallas. But I do agree that they can find ways to mitigate some flaws. And it is a bit much to get so down on Luka when the Celtics are just a much better team. People had unrealistic expectations for how Luka would perform against a team where everyone can give a decent effort against him and where everyone can drain shots if he takes off on defense.</p>

<p>This is similar to all the crazy takes about Tatum. I think people hope these guys can be Jordan or Lebron level when it comes to dominating the Finals and that causes them to overreact. Especially when we are looking back on Jordan and Lebron’s primes and greatest accomplishments and still just forecasting into the future for Tatum’s and Doncic’s careers.</p>

<p>Yeah all players have flaws, but if they&rsquo;re basketball related eventually you learn to live with them. But Luka&rsquo;s biggest flaws seem SO fixable (just stop bitching and play man).</p>

<p>Easier said than done though. I bet it comes with maturity, though you hope he figures it out before he leaves his physical prime</p>

      <label for="l8hvhp4" class="commentText"><p>The thing that bothers me the most is when people say he’s 95% of the reason they’re there as a way to lightly excuse his actions. They’re not looking at the fact that if he’s that big of a reason why they’re there, then it’s even more important for him to be on his A game or else they’ll 100% lose</p>

<p>And that’s what we’re seeing. It doesn’t matter if he’s 95% or 100% of the reason they’re there. Other teams don’t care about that because it’s their job to find your weakness and exploit it. And it so happens that even though Luka is 95% of the reason they’re there, he also makes up for a large portion of their weaknesses. Offensively he’s 95% the reason they win, but defensively he’s 90% of the reason they lose. The reason he’s a superstar is because his 95% offense is more than his 90% loss on defense, but that’s not enough for the NBA finals</p>

<p>For example, to win the finals, everyone needs to click 100%. How many teams have won recently with glaring mistakes and/or deficiencies?</p>

<p>And that’s where the mavs are right now</p>

<p>So I wish people will stop saying he’s 95% of the reason they’re here as if that tells the story. Saying he’s 95% of the reason they’re is not a good answer whenever someone points out that he’s now also 90% of the reason why they’ll lose because you can easily exploit him on defense. And they’re only really exploiting one person, the guy you can just run around and/or wait to get mad at the refs so that he takes himself out the play.</p>

<p>Until he gets the stamina to get them over 100%…he’ll be another play who never wins because I’ve never seen a superstar win who have it up 100% of the time on defense</p>

      <label for="l8gxgs0" class="commentText"><p>Nah I said this last night too, the Wolves for whatever reason are not a team that&rsquo;s big on switching to get favorable matchups on offense. For whatever reason Finch just does not prioritize it or gameplan for it. It&rsquo;s easy enough to send Rudy or Jaden for a pick and essentially force the defenders to switch if it&rsquo;s planned to the screening player&rsquo;s strengths but the gameplan just devolved into &ldquo;Ant needs to drive and attack more&rdquo;. Well, that&rsquo;s a lot easier to do with 1) a worse defender on him and 2) threats from other areas of the court opening up the lane for him, but with how KAT was shooting those first 3 games your only real option was getting a worse defender on him. Which again, didn&rsquo;t happen</p>

      <label for="l8i6c82" class="commentText"><p>This isn’t true. Defenders aren’t stupid. Why would you switch when Ant plays PnR with Kyle? Ant is getting better at PnR but isn’t good enough to make switching the best strategy. Finch doesn’t just get to Jedi mind trick them into switching because it’d be good for the wolves.</p>

<p>His offense is much more valuable than his defense is negative because he touches the ball on basically every play.</p>

<p>Swap Luka out with an elite defensive guard who is bad-mediocre offensively, and the Mavericks are immeasurably worse.</p>

      <label for="l8h1r95" class="commentText"><p>It kind of reminds how perimeter defense is somewhat irrelevant in the regular season in the sense that elite and bad individual perimeter defense don&rsquo;t have nearly as much impact on regular season winning compared to interior defense.</p>

<p>In the playoffs though it&rsquo;s different. You have the time to gameplan against a poor defender, you can attack them over and over, exhaust them, etc.</p>

<p>Usually this is more relevant for undersized defenders who are difficult to hide and Luka does have good size. But this deep in the playoffs the exhaustion is setting in and the Celtics don&rsquo;t have any weak offense players to hide Luka on. Plus he is handling the offensive load and the Celtics are full of long, strong defenders who will continue to wear him down</p>

      <label for="l8fnyf6" class="commentText"><p>I know it&rsquo;s basically a meme at this point but Luka needs to work on conditioning and defense.  He doesn&rsquo;t need to be all-NBA, but he needs to be less of a liability.  He will still be a HOFer if he doesn&rsquo;t do those things but it will be a lot harder for him to win a championship.</p>

<p>Boston is also probably the worst matchup for him in the league so his weaknesses are really being highlighted.</p>

<p>EDIT - Maybe this series will motivate him.  This is different, but I remember stories about Lebron seeing how hard Kobe dedicated himself during the 2008 Olympics, and then using that as motivation to improve himself.  He basically needed a wakeup call of sorts to realize what it would take to become an all-time player because natural skill alone isn&rsquo;t enough when you&rsquo;re trying to achieve that level.</p>

      <label for="l8g095g" class="commentText"><p>I dont really think he will change. This has been the story for the past few seasons. He needs to lose weight and needs to try harder on defense. The thing is he will probably come into next season 15 lbs lighter but he ends up gaining it back by the end of the season. If memory serves me right he&rsquo;s done this twice in the past 3 years and the other year he came to camp as fat as he is now</p>

      <label for="l8ftxm3" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think NBA All Star players actually change that much. The narrative that a hard loss makes them double down and work harder to get over the hump seems manufactured for the media.</p>

<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s about rosters. 21-22 Celts didn&rsquo;t forge Tatum and the team into a better players. The 23-24 Celts are just benefiting from the work Brad Stevens put in and better play from the pros pros like White and Holiday.</p>

<p>Same thing will happen with the Mavs. Either they pick up a complimentary group of players or their young guys will develop to cover Lukas issues or they won&rsquo;t. He will still be basically the same player.</p>

      <label for="l8jd6n8" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s just a narrative though. A story you can tell yourself to neatly package everything. Truth is if Luka has a 3rd scorer on this roster and doesn&rsquo;t run into a historically good Boston team we&rsquo;re not having this conversation.</p>

<p>Likewise there is no amount of &ldquo;maturity&rdquo; that Luka can attain that is likely to make a difference against a historically good team like this if he doesn&rsquo;t have a team in the same tier himself.</p>

<p>About his complaining, well yup, he should shut up some time, yesterday you could see it on his eyes when he found out he fucked up and there was no way back and to a toxic mf that hurts, you know you got beat at your own toxic game.</p>

      <label for="l8hvfs7" class="commentText"><p>Straight facts. Luka has been known to be bad on defense and to complain to the refs constantly. It&rsquo;s finally showing that these are bad habits that cannot be overcome by skill alone. He knows this, we know this, everyone knows this. If he continues to complain in game 4, Mavs will lose. Luka needs to spend literally all summer studying his defensive breakdowns and hammering his weaknesses, including conditioning. Hopefully losing in the finals will be enough motivation for him to work on his weaknesses.</p>
