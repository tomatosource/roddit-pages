      <label for="l8fh0kf" class="commentText"><p>Luka is 95% of the reason the Mavs are even in this position. But it’s gotta be so frustrating as a Mavs fan. Last night was a 7 point loss and Luka on his own left his team to play 5 v. 4 on defense like <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> times and cost them like 5-8 points. Not even talking about the bad defense, but complaining about bullshit and not even playing defense.</p>

<p>People are saying his defense needs to improve for him to win a ring, I think cutting out complaining and leaving his team out to dry on transition will honestly be good enough to get a Luka team over the hump</p>

<p>I just made a post on the Mavs subreddit about how it’s okay to have both of these opinions but it got taken down in less than 5 minutes. Meanwhile another fan literally went armchair psychiatrist suggesting that Kyrie needs therapy to play better in Boston and not only was it overwhelmingly upvoted but they left it up. Our mods suck.</p>

      <label for="l8gacla" class="commentText"><p>As a Celts fan, the funniest take I keep seeing is that Luka keeps getting cooked on D because he isn&rsquo;t giving it enough effort. Like this man is carrying the entire team on his back offensively, then being targeted on defense 75% of the time. I imagine he is exhausted and he is picking where to spend his energy. How can anyone blame him for not &ldquo;giving it his all&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Having said that, I agree with you. <strong>Emotionally</strong>, he has a ton of room to improve. He wastes so much time complaining which both leaves his team out to dry and brings the vibes down for the Mavs.</p>

<p>Tatum had the non-stop complaining problem until pretty recently he finally has toned it down. Overall, I don&rsquo;t really think Luka should get blamed for getting cooked on D, but I definitely think he can be blamed for the mindset he shows.</p>

<p>he also seems super beat up on top of it. like, playing injured, working through a ton of pain, trying to carry the offensive load <em>and</em> being targeted specifically on defense by a team as offensively varied as the Celtics&hellip; fuck, man, anyone would be pretty frustrated . It&rsquo;s a bad look, but I get it in that regard</p>

      <label for="l8gy229" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. This is such a level-headed perspective. Could/should he be doing better defensively, 100%, and I expect he&rsquo;ll get crushed this offseason over it and deservedly so. But this is so far and away from not being the top reason we&rsquo;re getting beat by Boston. The Celtics are just a much deeper &amp; better team right now. They may not have the best player but the Mavs in 2011 didn&rsquo;t have the best player and they still won.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s injured and worn down and it&rsquo;s really getting exposed on defense but he hasn&rsquo;t exactly been peak Luka offensively this round either. He&rsquo;s way too focused on trying to get fouls called rather than make buckets, but people only want to point out that he&rsquo;s a traffic cone defensively.</p>

      <label for="l8gwwjn" class="commentText"><p>The god given ability is part of it though.  Lebron having the literal perfect blend of size, strength and explosiveness is a big part of him being the in the conversation of the best ever basketball player.  Lebron had won 2 MVPs by age 25 and had made a finals without a player of Kyrie&rsquo;s caliber on the roster.  Luka has a significantly higher usage rate and is much more ball dominant than Lebron who was able to put up similar numbers when you adjust them for the pace of play on 6-7% lower usage.  Luka is much more James Harden then Lebron James.  This is without even factoring in Lebron&rsquo;s defensive ratings in his first 5-6 seasons in the league are about 10 points less per 100 possessions.</p>

<p>Edit: This isn&rsquo;t even a knock on Luka either, he&rsquo;s an amazing player but Lebron is in a class all by himself</p>

<p>The vast majority of people agree that Luka should be complaining less and have been constantly hoping that he stops/making posts about it. You really can&rsquo;t say that the sub is fine with it, outside of maybe a couple of outliers. The point that people disagree on is how much is it Luka&rsquo;s fault that we&rsquo;re losing due to complaining, not whether it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>My main problem with the moderation is what the mods consider to be &ldquo;off topic posts&rdquo;. Because they seem to think that everything is off topic somehow</p>

      <label for="l8fm7ld" class="commentText"><p>I think the complaining is pivotal but he needs to get in shape and be able to last a whole season. He couldn’t defend all series and got hunted relentlessly. Can’t be that big of a liability defensively and only score 27pts on 27 shot attempts in the biggest game of your life.</p>

<p>Not even touching the fact he fouled out which is inexcusable. He’s not mature enough yet to win and hopefully this loss makes him better but he needs to improve mentally, defensively, and physically if he wants to win. That or he needs to hope that the Mavs can build a roster around him that can rival Boston’s and that doesn’t seem likely</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t some random meltdown from Luka, it&rsquo;s calculated and the only way the Mavs had a shot. It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Outside on #1 and #2 the Celts are just a much better team. Luka is banged up. Coaching is in Bostons favor. He doesn&rsquo;t have it and he knows.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s hoping for favors from the refs to bail him out and get a win or too.</p>

That doesn’t have anything to do with being “overmatched” he’s just a cry baby and many other great players were early on too. The big 3 Heat whined and bitched so much that Dallas series that they had 3v5 in transition every time because Lebron and Wade would cry to refs.</p>

<p>Stars go through this shit all the time, now he needs to put in the work like the other greats did and get better</p>

<p>He would shoulder check/move Ant,  NAW, slow mo out the way then the next possession, have to gather his steps, be stuck and then fish flop around Mike Conley for shooting fouls, then quickly tell the team he&rsquo;s okay and shoot his FTs.</p>

<p>Also that final stretch Before the blocking foul was crazy.</p>

<p>The refs were holding their whistles on both sides and the bumps and fouls were getting hard around Tatum, Brown, Kyrie and Luka.</p>

Luka is a top 3 player in the league and the media and fans are treating him like a middle schooler who needs to stop yelling at refs. Every star yells at refs lol</p>

      <label for="l8fh51d" class="commentText"><p>I am glad you posted this because there are so many saying &lsquo;oh well, Luka had one bad game and he is getting dog piled on&rsquo;. This is just typical Luka defense, it&rsquo;s not like oh all of a sudden he can&rsquo;t defend. He&rsquo;s also playing against the likely NBA champions so the talent level on a game to game basis against the Celtics is going to be much elevated than a team like the Rockets, Pistons or even the Hornets.</p>

      <label for="l8fw81w" class="commentText"><p>After the Wolves series, I had people telling me he was a legit two way player, he&rsquo;s other worldy on offense, but the dude just stands around sucking air guarding the other teams worst player on defense. That&rsquo;s by definition a one dimensional player in my book.</p>

      <label for="l8gxgs0" class="commentText"><p>Nah I said this last night too, the Wolves for whatever reason are not a team that&rsquo;s big on switching to get favorable matchups on offense. For whatever reason Finch just does not prioritize it or gameplan for it. It&rsquo;s easy enough to send Rudy or Jaden for a pick and essentially force the defenders to switch if it&rsquo;s planned to the screening player&rsquo;s strengths but the gameplan just devolved into &ldquo;Ant needs to drive and attack more&rdquo;. Well, that&rsquo;s a lot easier to do with 1) a worse defender on him and 2) threats from other areas of the court opening up the lane for him, but with how KAT was shooting those first 3 games your only real option was getting a worse defender on him. Which again, didn&rsquo;t happen</p>

      <label for="l8gjp4b" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that’s all fine and well but of you can “muster up” on the offensive end and do Luka shit at lets say 75%-95% intensity on offense you can for sure do it on defense, especially in the finals.</p>

<p>The thing that I dont understand is he has the foresight to be able to hesi, euro and do luka magic shit on offense to get players in bad position.</p>

<p>He does that to good, fast, tall, short, big people. So he can OBVIOUSLY move a substantial amount in those instances to create space….. Suuuuurely some of that can transfer to the defensive side of the ball where you at least contain your opponent to some degree at least a small amount of the time.</p>

<p>I get that theres diff rulesets on offense and defense but quite a lot of his guarding is pure conditioning and pride/ego. At the NBA level, it is beyond a joke especially in the finals.</p>

<p>Its an obvious weakness he’s chosen to ignore and whine about to boot. That’s fine by me lol because thats just going to be exploited no matter what he thinks and teams will target him for it.</p>

<p>In an aim to keep things balanced i just wanna point out that Tatum also bitches and complains too and hes riding a fine line. As much as I despise whiners he at the very least does it while getting back on defense most of the time and isnt an outright deliberate nuisance to his own team….yet.</p>

<p>He’s at least pouting his balls off but still taking care of the majority of his business.</p>

      <label for="l8gwlc9" class="commentText"><p>And they do. The wolves had the number 1 overall defense but Gobert was a big part of that. Their wing defenders aren’t strong and big enough to limit a guy like Doncic. And the Celtics are so much better offensively that they make Luka work much harder than he did in Wolves series. So he is more prone to be gassed. Just a completely different matchup and level of talent going from Wolves to Celtics.</p>

<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s about rosters. 21-22 Celts didn&rsquo;t forge Tatum and the team into a better players. The 23-24 Celts are just benefiting from the work Brad Stevens put in and better play from the pros pros like White and Holiday.</p>

<p>Same thing will happen with the Mavs. Either they pick up a complimentary group of players or their young guys will develop to cover Lukas issues or they won&rsquo;t. He will still be basically the same player.</p>

      <label for="l8fnyf6" class="commentText"><p>I know it&rsquo;s basically a meme at this point but Luka needs to work on conditioning and defense.  He doesn&rsquo;t need to be all-NBA, but he needs to be less of a liability.  He will still be a HOFer if he doesn&rsquo;t do those things but it will be a lot harder for him to win a championship.</p>

<p>Boston is also probably the worst matchup for him in the league so his weaknesses are really being highlighted.</p>

<p>EDIT - Maybe this series will motivate him.  This is different, but I remember stories about Lebron seeing how hard Kobe dedicated himself during the 2008 Olympics, and then using that as motivation to improve himself.  He basically needed a wakeup call of sorts to realize what it would take to become an all-time player because natural skill alone isn&rsquo;t enough when you&rsquo;re trying to achieve that level.</p>

The thing is he will probably come into next season 15 lbs lighter but he ends up gaining it back by the end of the season. If memory serves me right he&rsquo;s done this twice in the past 3 years and the other year he came to camp as fat as he is now</p>

Luka has been a matador on defense this whole series and has faded badly in the fourth quarters because he isn&rsquo;t in shape to play on both ends all game. The blame is by no means all on Luka&rsquo;s shoulders, but the Celtics have shone a spotlight on Luka&rsquo;s shortcomings in this series and are up 3-0 because of it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s trend to hate his flaws right now, which always happen to the losing side. But it&rsquo;s fucking insane to claim that  theyre losing the finals because of him when he had to play vs Boston alone on offense for 2 games while also being targeted on defense.</p>

<p>Nobody is solely at fault for any of the loses. Everybody has some blame but first 2 games were mainly on Kyrie. Third game is mainly on Luka.</p>

      <label for="l8g9pj4" class="commentText"><p>The Mavs are built entirely around Luka, it&rsquo;s one of the most heliocentric teams since Harden. If the Mavs being 0-3 after three games where he wasn&rsquo;t able to show up in the 4th quarter isn&rsquo;t on him then I don&rsquo;t know what is. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s the only reason or the other players aren&rsquo;t also part of the problem, but the Celtics gameplan has been to shine a light on Luka&rsquo;s weaknesses and it is working like a charm. Luka is giving up points with bad defense and not getting back because he&rsquo;s complaining to the refs, and part of the reason the role players are struggling is that Luka can&rsquo;t generate easy looks for them if he&rsquo;s not being doubled. I don&rsquo;t see how you can watch the same games I&rsquo;ve watched and say Luka hasn&rsquo;t been exposed as a one-way player whose terrible defense and inadequate conditioning is letting his team down. There are other reasons for the series too, of course, it&rsquo;s a team game, but that is the biggest reason.</p>

      <label for="l8gbsna" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics are definetly the worst possible matchup for Mavs we can agree on that. They neutralize them and exploit their weaknesses perfectly. They force Mavs to play 1 on 1 which only Luka and Ky can do.</p>

<p>I believe Mavericks can win a ring the way the currently play, but not when they face a team like Celtics which is just an anomaly of a team. Like many people have said this is a scissors rock situation with Celtics being a rock.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s mavs system that&rsquo;s exploitable and if you think that&rsquo;s Luka&rsquo;s fault because they play that system because of him then fine, you&rsquo;re right in that regard.    Mavs haven&rsquo;t crossed 100 points so far in the finals, the offense outside of Luka is just trash because everybody on Celtics can just guard 1 on 1, that&rsquo;s rare as fuck.  Luka&rsquo;s defense and whining is problem for Dallas, but it&rsquo;s not problem 1 or 2 in this series. For me it&rsquo;s not really been how bad Dallas is, but how unbelievable Boston look. I don&rsquo;t really like Tatum tbh but I gotta give credit where credits due. Deserved ring.</p>

<p>About his complaining, well yup, he should shut up some time, yesterday you could see it on his eyes when he found out he fucked up and there was no way back and to a toxic mf that hurts, you know you got beat at your own toxic game.</p>

<p>luka is pretty clearly worse, but not that much different habit wise at the same stage of their career (i might be off by a year), bron didn&rsquo;t start taking defense seriously until after 07, and then he didn&rsquo;t get really good until miami, and then he still was taking the lightest assignment possible the vast majority of every game</p>

LeBron might not have taken defense as seriously until after 07, but he was always more physically gifted than anyone he was guarding and had unreal stamina. His defensive rating was around 103-104 before &lsquo;07, then after it was around 99-103. Yes, he definitely did improve, but he was never a negative to his team the way Luka is currently.</p>

Their rebounding styles are almost identical too, wait around and gobble up the free board.</p>

<p>and lebron&rsquo;s entire career is guarding the least athletic and capable player on the other team like 80-90% of games. Elite plays here and there, obviously, but the not taking every play seriously and not putting as much effort into that side of the ball is similar at their same stages of careers so far.</p>

<p>both have the exact same narratives about their play is the point i was making (too good too young to build a proper team around them, no help in losses, heroic in every win, the demonstrativeness and ball-dominance are very similar as well)</p>

You must have missed his entire first stint in Cleveland, where he was surrounded by a bunch of bums and dragged them to the finals. He didn&rsquo;t even have a #2 who was anywhere close to as good as Kyrie. He guarded Paul Pierce on every possession when they played the Celtics</p>

      <label for="l8fkvbc" class="commentText"><p>Luka deserves criticism for his play in this Finals, but it&rsquo;s ludicrous to say that he CAN&rsquo;T win this way. His team is in this position primarily because of his amazing play. Dallas&rsquo;s team is far inferior to Boston&rsquo;s. If he was able to play with four two-way high level players 90% of the time like Tatum is, he very well could win a title. A much more flawed #1 is winning the title right this moment, ffs.</p>

He&rsquo;s a better two-way player, sure, but he is also significantly less efficient as a scorer and far less dominant in the clutch, especially in the playoffs. I think he&rsquo;s far less valuable overall, and I don&rsquo;t think that was controversial until everyone decided Luka was bad because his team got its ass kicked in the Finals.</p>

<p>His offense is obviously incredible but if an opposing team targets your number one player all game, he&rsquo;s incredibly flawed.</p>

<p>Even if he had some desire to even try on defense, because of his stamina he&rsquo;d suffer on offense.</p>

<p>So you not realize that part of the reason he&rsquo;s so good at offense is because he usually doesn&rsquo;t ever have to do anything on the other side of the ball?</p>

<p>Not to mention kyrie was hard carrying them at a point last night and Luka came back in and kyrie didn&rsquo;t shoot for like four possessions.</p>

<p>Tatum is struggling on offense in the postseason but he&rsquo;s still making plays that help is team. Lukas flaws are entirely his own fault</p>
