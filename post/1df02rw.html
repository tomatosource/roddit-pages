      <label for="l8fh0kf" class="commentText"><p>Luka is 95% of the reason the Mavs are even in this position. But it’s gotta be so frustrating as a Mavs fan. Last night was a 7 point loss and Luka on his own left his team to play 5 v. 4 on defense like <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> times and cost them like 5-8 points. Not even talking about the bad defense, but complaining about bullshit and not even playing defense.</p>

<p>People are saying his defense needs to improve for him to win a ring, I think cutting out complaining and leaving his team out to dry on transition will honestly be good enough to get a Luka team over the hump</p>

<p>I just made a post on the Mavs subreddit about how it’s okay to have both of these opinions but it got taken down in less than 5 minutes. Meanwhile another fan literally went armchair psychiatrist suggesting that Kyrie needs therapy to play better in Boston and not only was it overwhelmingly upvoted but they left it up. Our mods suck.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people agree that Luka should be complaining less and have been constantly hoping that he stops/making posts about it. You really can&rsquo;t say that the sub is fine with it, outside of maybe a couple of outliers. The point that people disagree on is how much is it Luka&rsquo;s fault that we&rsquo;re losing due to complaining, not whether it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My main problem with the moderation is what the mods consider to be &ldquo;off topic posts&rdquo;. Because they seem to think that everything is off topic somehow</p>

      <label for="l8fm7ld" class="commentText"><p>I think the complaining is pivotal but he needs to get in shape and be able to last a whole season. He couldn’t defend all series and got hunted relentlessly. Can’t be that big of a liability defensively and only score 27pts on 27 shot attempts in the biggest game of your life.</p>

<p>Not even touching the fact he fouled out which is inexcusable. He’s not mature enough yet to win and hopefully this loss makes him better but he needs to improve mentally, defensively, and physically if he wants to win. That or he needs to hope that the Mavs can build a roster around him that can rival Boston’s and that doesn’t seem likely</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t some random meltdown from Luka, it&rsquo;s calculated and the only way the Mavs had a shot. It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Outside on #1 and #2 the Celts are just a much better team. Luka is banged up. Coaching is in Bostons favor. He doesn&rsquo;t have it and he knows.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s hoping for favors from the refs to bail him out and get a win or too.</p>

That doesn’t have anything to do with being “overmatched” he’s just a cry baby and many other great players were early on too. The big 3 Heat whined and bitched so much that Dallas series that they had 3v5 in transition every time because Lebron and Wade would cry to refs.</p>

<p>Stars go through this shit all the time, now he needs to put in the work like the other greats did and get better</p>

He needs to get roasted and get a reality check if he&rsquo;s going to get to the next level. That is just unacceptable idc how good your offense is. You can&rsquo;t win a championship like that.</p>

<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s about rosters. 21-22 Celts didn&rsquo;t forge Tatum and the team into a better players. The 23-24 Celts are just benefiting from the work Brad Stevens put in and better play from the pros pros like White and Holiday.</p>

<p>Same thing will happen with the Mavs. Either they pick up a complimentary group of players or their young guys will develop to cover Lukas issues or they won&rsquo;t. He will still be basically the same player.</p>

      <label for="l8fnyf6" class="commentText"><p>I know it&rsquo;s basically a meme at this point but Luka needs to work on conditioning and defense.  He doesn&rsquo;t need to be all-NBA, but he needs to be less of a liability.  He will still be a HOFer if he doesn&rsquo;t do those things but it will be a lot harder for him to win a championship.</p>

<p>Boston is also probably the worst matchup for him in the league so his weaknesses are really being highlighted.</p>

<p>EDIT - Maybe this series will motivate him.  This is different, but I remember stories about Lebron seeing how hard Kobe dedicated himself during the 2008 Olympics, and then using that as motivation to improve himself.  He basically needed a wakeup call of sorts to realize what it would take to become an all-time player because natural skill alone isn&rsquo;t enough when you&rsquo;re trying to achieve that level.</p>

The thing is he will probably come into next season 15 lbs lighter but he ends up gaining it back by the end of the season. If memory serves me right he&rsquo;s done this twice in the past 3 years and the other year he came to camp as fat as he is now</p>

<p>luka is pretty clearly worse, but not that much different habit wise at the same stage of their career (i might be off by a year), bron didn&rsquo;t start taking defense seriously until after 07, and then he didn&rsquo;t get really good until miami, and then he still was taking the lightest assignment possible the vast majority of every game</p>

      <label for="l8fvddm" class="commentText"><p>I watched LeBron play live from the start of his career, so no, not young. LeBron might not have taken defense as seriously until after 07, but he was always more physically gifted than anyone he was guarding and had unreal stamina. His defensive rating was around 103-104 before &lsquo;07, then after it was around 99-103. Yes, he definitely did improve, but he was never a negative to his team the way Luka is currently.</p>

      <label for="l8fkvbc" class="commentText"><p>Luka deserves criticism for his play in this Finals, but it&rsquo;s ludicrous to say that he CAN&rsquo;T win this way. His team is in this position primarily because of his amazing play. Dallas&rsquo;s team is far inferior to Boston&rsquo;s. If he was able to play with four two-way high level players 90% of the time like Tatum is, he very well could win a title. A much more flawed #1 is winning the title right this moment, ffs.</p>

His defense and ability to cover multiple positions have been critical to Boston&rsquo;s success, whereas Luka&rsquo;s defense has been atrocious.  Luka&rsquo;s offense is on another level but I fail to see how Tatum is a more &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; #1.</p>

He&rsquo;s a better two-way player, sure, but he is also significantly less efficient as a scorer and far less dominant in the clutch, especially in the playoffs. I think he&rsquo;s far less valuable overall, and I don&rsquo;t think that was controversial until everyone decided Luka was bad because his team got its ass kicked in the Finals.</p>

<p>His offense is obviously incredible but if an opposing team targets your number one player all game, he&rsquo;s incredibly flawed.</p>

<p>Even if he had some desire to even try on defense, because of his stamina he&rsquo;d suffer on offense.</p>

<p>So you not realize that part of the reason he&rsquo;s so good at offense is because he usually doesn&rsquo;t ever have to do anything on the other side of the ball?</p>

<p>Not to mention kyrie was hard carrying them at a point last night and Luka came back in and kyrie didn&rsquo;t shoot for like four possessions.</p>

<p>Tatum is struggling on offense in the postseason but he&rsquo;s still making plays that help is team. Lukas flaws are entirely his own fault</p>
