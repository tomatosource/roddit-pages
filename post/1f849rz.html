      <label for="llcg3bl" class="commentText"><p>And Wade <em>also</em> got one of the most favorable whistles I&rsquo;ve seen in a playoff series</p>

<p>But all of that aside, the Mavs choked the series away at the end of game 3&hellip; and if you watch the last few minutes of that one, that was definitely <em>not</em> due to the refs (D Wade took 3 FT during the 13-pt comeback in the last 6 min, one was an and-1 and the other 2 came from an intentional foul with under 2 sec left in the game).  Dirk even bricked a tying FT with like 3 sec left in the game.  It was their own fault.</p>

<p>So as easy as it is to point to fishy officiating as the reason for the Heat winning that series, all of it would&rsquo;ve been a moot point if the Mavs hadn&rsquo;t blown their chance to go up 3-0.</p>

He only made 18. Wade’s 21 made free throws in Game 5 of the 2006 Finals is the most made free throws in an NBA Finals game. Also in Game 5, Shaq attempted 12 free throws and only made 2 of them.</p>

<p>Most FT made in a single NBA Finals game with 21.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/who-has-the-most-total-fta-in-a-single-nba-finals" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/who-has-the-most-total-fta-in-a-single-nba-finals</a></p>

<p>2nd all time in total FTA in Finals history.  #1 Elgin Baylor played 7 games.  Wade played 6.</p>

<p>2nd most FTA per game in Finals history.  #1 is Shaq with the Hack-A-Shaq.  Jordan&rsquo;s highest is #18.  Maybe Jordan just never drive to the basket as much.  That&rsquo;s why Wade averaged so many more.  /s</p>

      <label for="llc5wvn" class="commentText"><p>Tbf, Wade admitted to becoming a ft merchant for that series by taking advantage of the rules. On a few podcasts over the years he has said that he was reading through the rulebook heading into that Finals and saw that he could legally initiate contact with a defender when driving to the rim by throwing his body into them to draw a foul so he just kept doing it.</p>

<p>I believe they changed the rule the following season</p>

<p>You think it’s a coincidence he couldnt get access to game 5 which was one of the worst displays of officiating I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>I only used his video because he’s a high profile youtuber and it’s hard to find the full games now. </p>

<p>In terms of the C&rsquo;s, Stern was commissioner during the 80s. C&rsquo;s traded with Lakers and beat Houston twice. I&rsquo;ve never heard any complaints of lopsided Finals calls in 81, 84 or 86.</p>

<p>2008 ditto</p>

<p>2024 the same.</p>

<p>Most I&rsquo;ve heard is likely some favored calls in eastern series against the Bucks in <sup>87</sup>&frasl;<sub>88</sub>. But never have heard a peep about it turning a series.</p>

<p>You had one team made from the draft and a hometown star with Grit and down hill play and then the “super” team that joined up and played like they were made of glass and pretended they were concussed or their eye poked out when no one touched them. It literally ruined the NBA for me.</p>

      <label for="llc8l8y" class="commentText"><p>Having rooted for the Mavs in the 2006 Finals, I think it&rsquo;s true that those Finals were poorly officiated, but I also think it&rsquo;s true that FTA is a really bad way to measure that. Especially in games 5 and 6, Wade was constantly attacking the paint, whereas that Mavs team was composed of jump shooters and didn&rsquo;t really have any inside scorers. It would be expected that Wade would draw a relatively high number of free throws just because of his playing style.</p>

<p>What we&rsquo;d really need is to have some better analysis of expected FTA (like looking at which ones were called which shouldn&rsquo;t be, or potential ones that weren&rsquo;t) but that&rsquo;s hyper-subjective and time consuming to do on a full game.</p>

Wade only shot 3 FT (and 2 were from an intentional foul at the end) and Dirk bricked a tying FT with 3 sec left.</p>

<p>None of the shitty officiating would&rsquo;ve ended up mattering if not for that all-time choke job.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Wade&rsquo;s freethrows were fraudulent as there were a lot of genuine fouls. I&rsquo;m saying they could have came more the other way in those closing games.</p>

      <label for="llc4cf6" class="commentText"><p>He didn’t actually attempt more free throws. Game 5 and 6 it really felt like you couldn’t touch Wade, though. He attempted the same amount of FT’s in game 5 as the Mavs team and that’s probably what Cuban is referencing. Simultaneously it felt like Dirk wouldn’t get a call unless Haslem mugged him. I’m a Mavs fan, so I’m pretty biased and I haven’t watched this series in a long time, but I still remember that it felt different those last couple games and Wade shouldn’t have gotten those FT’s to close out game 5. Then the series goes to 7 and there’s probably less controversy if that happens. But maybe not, guys just didn’t get FT’s as often back then and Wade lived there the last 2 games.</p>

      <label for="llbzyuh" class="commentText"><p>Well if you look at styles, Wade was a slashing guard with a whopping usage % of 37%. He had the ball all the time, and most of the time he just drove to the basket. The Mavs were a pass-first shooting team who didn’t really have any slashers/interior presence aside from Dirk when he really had to. I’m a Heat fan, so I’ll always defend that series, and while I’ll concede that the refs helped keep the Heat in the series, I don’t think any of the calls were egregiously bad nor did they gift them the series. They still had to come back from being down 2-0</p>

      <label for="llcfw2p" class="commentText"><p>There’s a lot of factors that get glossed over.</p>

<p>The Pistons won in 2004 with smothering defense. Cuban and others approached the league about how the offense needs more power and lobbied for freedom of movement rules for wing players. The NBA did in fact change the rules and eliminated hand checking after 2004.</p>

<p>The Mavericks were not a good defensive team and also benefited from reffing. I believe Dirk see a record regarding free throws on the way to the Finals.</p>

<p>Dwayne Wade is an all time athletic slashing guard to the point many consider him the 3rd best SG of all time despite the fact he played his whole NBA career without his meniscus in one knee.</p>

<p>So add all that up.</p>

<p>One of the best slashers ever goes against subpar wing defenders and rim defenders. The wing defenders have been hampered by the removal of hand checking and this is the second season with that rule. Team managers are not yet building and scheming with that rule in mind and even the refs are still adjusting to that rule change. What do you think is going to happen when you have Baby Jordan slashing to the hoop every play?</p>

<p>For people who think it’s rigged, I highly encourage you to watch the fouls and tell us which fouls were phantom calls. Wade was getting at least 90% legit calls.</p>

<p>Even what Cuban complains about with regard to Shaq is the same old shit we saw Shaq’s whole career so his complaint is just the same anti-Shaq bitching we heard every year back then</p>

Overwhelming majority of the fouls called were indeed fouls and the differences in free throw totals can easily be explained by play style, and anyone who &ldquo;remembered watching live&rdquo; probably didn&rsquo;t actually go back and watch those games again or see any of the subsequent analysis that makes it obvious all the controversy is sour grapes over a team getting worked by one of the greatest finals performances ever</p>

      <label for="llc7tw9" class="commentText"><p>I was not just alive, but an adult and watching every game of that series. The Mavs lost because the refs were not calling the game equally - Wade got the softest whistle I&rsquo;ve seen in a Finals in Games 3, 5 and 6. The Mavs - and especially Dirk - decidedly did not get the same treatment. That series wasn&rsquo;t basketball, that series was pure WWE bullshit.</p>

<p>The whole series disgusted me and I didn&rsquo;t watch the NBA for two years. And I was cheering for the Heat heading into the series!</p>

<p>Cue people telling me who The Flash just couldn&rsquo;t be stopped. Well yeah, when you&rsquo;re initiating contact without even looking at the fucking rim knowing you&rsquo;ll get a touch call on nearly every possession, definitionally you cannot be stopped.</p>

<p>10:20 &ndash; The Mavs take Maurice Ager at No. 28. He puts his head in his hands and starts sobbing hysterically as his entourage congratulates him. It&rsquo;s about time we had some emotion tonight, dammit. <strong>Ager walks up to the stage in a triple-breasted, oversized beige suit, goes to shake hands with [NBA Commissioner David] Stern and immediately gets whistled for a foul on Dwyane Wade.</strong></p>

Personally I would hesitate against a guy who had 7” and nearly 50 lbs on me UNLESS I knew he couldn’t even touch me.</p>

<p>But of course you can make the argument that he attacked the rim the same way,  but his 10.7 FTA/g would argue against it. I’m sure there’s probably more advanced metrics that argue the other way to be fair, I just haven’t looked in to it.</p>

<p>After game 4 we all knew the refs had decided the winner. Game 5 and 6 were just confirmation, and I also say this as someone who also watched it at the time, didn’t miss a single minute.</p>

No one should be single handedly equaling a team in FTA, much as less doing it in 2 straight games that closed out the series. Will always be sus in my book whether anything nefarious happened or not.</p>

<p>for that series, Duncan still shot 10 more free throws than Dirk, and the spurs still shot more free throws</p>

<p>the heat shot like 60 more freethrows</p>

<p>also 11 isn&rsquo;t that crazy when you had 24 in one game in a 7 game series, so the rest of the games he probably shot 8-9 per game, which was probably his season average if you account for the higher mins</p>

<p>These things aren’t mutually exclusive, and can both contribute to the Mavs losing the series. Plus Dirty got his revenge 5 years later. Hopefully we can get round 3 in the next couple of years, I’m not sure how much Jimmy has left in the tank tho.</p>

<p>I only used his video because the full games are hard to find now and he’s a high profile youtuber. He confirmed that everyone back then was talking about how the Mavs got robbed.</p>

      <label for="llc7zvd" class="commentText"><p>Bruh people are being so dumb about free throws. Fuck the watchability this is about winning games and you gotta do whatever you can to get that done. NBA trying to turn everything into a show for fans is what is ruining the league and it&rsquo;s watchability in its first place. Just look how much better it was at the Olympics. With a big body in the middle there is less opportunity to drive to the rim = less fouls being called. FIBA is played on mid range and perimeter.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all part of the game. Don&rsquo;t fucking jump for a pump fake like a dumbass. It&rsquo;s the no. 1 defensive lesson in the EU ball. Stay on the ground, never jump, keep hands up.</p>

<p>Dwayne Wade was a slasher that drove to the basket a lot. His quickness and speed displaced defenders and put em in position they had to foul to prevent easy buckets.</p>

<p>I dare anyone to go back and look at the tape foul for foul and tell me how many fouls shouldn&rsquo;t be called. That shit was negligible. Mavs were desperate trying to stop him so they hacked the shit out of him anytime he drove to the rim.</p>

<p>Saying it was refs is a dumbass copout trying to mask your bad defense.</p>

      <label for="llc2m58" class="commentText"><p>It’s kind of ridiculous to me how fans always expect no variance in free throws between teams and assume any disparity is proof of some form of intervention.</p>

<p>Free throws can be used to critique officials but there’s multiple factors to control for before you can say “Look! Numbers not same!”</p>

<p>The difference between Devin Harris, Josh Howard, old Jerry Stackhouse, Erick Dampier/Desagiana Diop and Shawn Marion, old Jason Kidd, Tyson Chandler/Brendan Haywood, the ghost of Peja, half a season of Caron Butler etc is pretty stark.</p>

      <label for="llcbfe0" class="commentText"><p>Good to see even almost 2 decades ago, SORE LOSERS still cried about &ldquo;free throws&rdquo; and officiating, instead of accepting the real facts and their own shortcomings.</p>

<p>if you watch the game, you can clearly see exactly WHY D-Wade got those free throws.  Obviously he got many &ldquo;star player calls&rdquo;, which always happened in the NBA.   But Wade was CONSTANTLY attacking the rim.  He barely shot the ball.   No one was shooting much back then, and Wade was a pure slasher.   THE FLASH</p>

<p>When you attack the hoop that much, you&rsquo;ll get more calls, usually.  Plus, Mavs defenders poorly fouled Wade a lot, instead of playing smart defense.   They should&rsquo;ve FORCED him to shoot, but they never did that.</p>

<p>Mavs never attacked the rim as much, because they never had someone like Wade.    Heat also had SHAQ in the middle.   It was an old and declined SHAQ, but he was still a massive presence in the middle.   He got fouled a lot too</p>
