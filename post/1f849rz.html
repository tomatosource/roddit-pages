      <label for="llcg3bl" class="commentText"><p>And Wade <em>also</em> got one of the most favorable whistles I&rsquo;ve seen in a playoff series</p>

<p>But all of that aside, the Mavs choked the series away at the end of game 3&hellip; and if you watch the last few minutes of that one, that was definitely <em>not</em> due to the refs (D Wade took 3 FT during the 13-pt comeback in the last 6 min, one was an and-1 and the other 2 came from an intentional foul with under 2 sec left in the game).  Dirk even bricked a tying FT with like 3 sec left in the game.  It was their own fault.</p>

<p>So as easy as it is to point to fishy officiating as the reason for the Heat winning that series, all of it would&rsquo;ve been a moot point if the Mavs hadn&rsquo;t blown their chance to go up 3-0.</p>

<p>Most FT made in a single NBA Finals game with 21.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/who-has-the-most-total-fta-in-a-single-nba-finals" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/who-has-the-most-total-fta-in-a-single-nba-finals</a></p>

<p>2nd all time in total FTA in Finals history.  #1 Elgin Baylor played 7 games.  Wade played 6.</p>

<p>2nd most FTA per game in Finals history.  #1 is Shaq with the Hack-A-Shaq.  Jordan&rsquo;s highest is #18.  Maybe Jordan just never drive to the basket as much.  That&rsquo;s why Wade averaged so many more.  /s</p>

      <label for="llc297s" class="commentText"><p>FT merchants are automatically my least favorite form of player. I always just think of how stupid they&rsquo;d look in pickup calling their own fouls for just running into guys.</p>

<p>Edit: just because I&rsquo;m sick of ppl saying the same thing, I&rsquo;m fully aware Wade isn&rsquo;t prime Harden levels of foul baiting. And for all you saying he never did it, you&rsquo;re just telling on yourselves that you never watched Miami before 2011.</p>

<p>A) the mavs defenders jumped at every damn pump fake (easy way to send someone to the line)</p>

<p>B) the mavs settled for mid range jump shots (easy way to never go to the line)</p>

On a few podcasts over the years he has said that he was reading through the rulebook heading into that Finals and saw that he could legally initiate contact with a defender when driving to the rim by throwing his body into them to draw a foul so he just kept doing it.</p>

<p>I believe they changed the rule the following season</p>

Especially in games 5 and 6, Wade was constantly attacking the paint, whereas that Mavs team was composed of jump shooters and didn&rsquo;t really have any inside scorers. It would be expected that Wade would draw a relatively high number of free throws just because of his playing style.</p>

      <label for="llcfq4g" class="commentText"><p>People want an objective stat of officiating bias without putting in the work that&rsquo;s needed. The FTA disparity argument is one of those I find myself most annoyed by because of that laziness - not every game should have equal FTA.</p>

<p>What we&rsquo;d really need is to have some better analysis of expected FTA (like looking at which ones were called which shouldn&rsquo;t be, or potential ones that weren&rsquo;t) but that&rsquo;s hyper-subjective and time consuming to do on a full game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Wade&rsquo;s freethrows were fraudulent as there were a lot of genuine fouls. I&rsquo;m saying they could have came more the other way in those closing games.</p>

<p>10:20 &ndash; The Mavs take Maurice Ager at No. 28. He puts his head in his hands and starts sobbing hysterically as his entourage congratulates him. It&rsquo;s about time we had some emotion tonight, dammit. <strong>Ager walks up to the stage in a triple-breasted, oversized beige suit, goes to shake hands with [NBA Commissioner David] Stern and immediately gets whistled for a foul on Dwyane Wade.</strong></p>

      <label for="llc4cf6" class="commentText"><p>He didn’t actually attempt more free throws. Game 5 and 6 it really felt like you couldn’t touch Wade, though. He attempted the same amount of FT’s in game 5 as the Mavs team and that’s probably what Cuban is referencing. Simultaneously it felt like Dirk wouldn’t get a call unless Haslem mugged him. I’m a Mavs fan, so I’m pretty biased and I haven’t watched this series in a long time, but I still remember that it felt different those last couple games and Wade shouldn’t have gotten those FT’s to close out game 5. Then the series goes to 7 and there’s probably less controversy if that happens. But maybe not, guys just didn’t get FT’s as often back then and Wade lived there the last 2 games.</p>

      <label for="llbzyuh" class="commentText"><p>Well if you look at styles, Wade was a slashing guard with a whopping usage % of 37%. He had the ball all the time, and most of the time he just drove to the basket. The Mavs were a pass-first shooting team who didn’t really have any slashers/interior presence aside from Dirk when he really had to. I’m a Heat fan, so I’ll always defend that series, and while I’ll concede that the refs helped keep the Heat in the series, I don’t think any of the calls were egregiously bad nor did they gift them the series. They still had to come back from being down 2-0</p>

<p>Yeah Wade was so untouchable in the 4th quarter of Game 3 that he shot a whopping [checks notes] 3 free throw attempts which includes two attempts on an intentional foul at the end of the game to stop the clock.</p>

      <label for="llc7tw9" class="commentText"><p>I was not just alive, but an adult and watching every game of that series. The Mavs lost because the refs were not calling the game equally - Wade got the softest whistle I&rsquo;ve seen in a Finals in Games 3, 5 and 6. The Mavs - and especially Dirk - decidedly did not get the same treatment. That series wasn&rsquo;t basketball, that series was pure WWE bullshit.</p>

<p>The whole series disgusted me and I didn&rsquo;t watch the NBA for two years. And I was cheering for the Heat heading into the series!</p>

<p>Cue people telling me who The Flash just couldn&rsquo;t be stopped. Well yeah, when you&rsquo;re initiating contact without even looking at the fucking rim knowing you&rsquo;ll get a touch call on nearly every possession, definitionally you cannot be stopped.</p>

<p>In all 3 of those games the Heat shot almost twice as many FTs as the Mavs, like 34 to 16 in G3 and a whopping 49 to 25 in G5.</p>

<p>If you agree the reffing was slanted (obviously FT counts need context but there’s a strong argument there imo). Miami simply doesn’t win without it.</p>

<p>NBA wanted to get away from the low-scoring defensive slugfests after Spurs/Pistons the year before. They apparently didn&rsquo;t understand that watching Wade shoot FTs all night wasn&rsquo;t very entertaining, either.</p>

<p>So we got very similar scoring totals, but also got to watch one guy FT shoot his way to 34ppg.</p>

<p>Wade was balling even without their help, but the refs really nerfed that series.</p>

<p>Wade had a breakout series and the rest of his career showed that his performance wasn&rsquo;t a fluke.</p>

<p>he also got a crazy soft whistle considering how much refs (at the time) used to swallow their whistles in the playoffs.</p>

<p>its not the most egregious officiating of all time, but it was a big outlier within the era (hence why everyone reacted to it because it <em>looked</em> different).</p>

      <label for="llctetu" class="commentText"><p>Even people back then were saying it was rigged. D-Wade, one of my fav players when I was a kid, shot an insane amount of free throws in that Finals</p>

<p>Not only did D-Wade shoot almost 100 free throws in the 2006 Finals, he shot more free throws than either team in the 2007 Finals the next year (Spurs 92, Cavs 75), he shot almost double the free throws of anyone in the Finals after that between Boston and LA (Pierce 53, Kobe 49) and then between the Lakers and Magic (Kobe 44, Dwight 58), D-Wade&rsquo;s 97 free throws is far ahead of anyone in the Finals after that too (Pau 61, Paul &ldquo;shit my pants&rdquo; Pierce 37) and the Finals after that (Dirk 46, D-Wade 49)</p>

<p>By comparison, D-Wade&rsquo;s free throws in 2006 were more than either team had in last year&rsquo;s Finals with Boston and Dallas, in the 18 years since the 2006 Finals only one guy has shot +70 free throws and that was Giannis v the Suns (85), and the Suns were doing hack-a-Shaq on him to intentionally make him shoot free throws because that was his only weakness, and he STILL didn&rsquo;t hit 90 lmao</p>

<p>So, say whatever you want about Mark Cuban and those Mavs but they have a legitimate gripe</p>

      <label for="llcgpf7" class="commentText"><p>This finals was rigged.  It&rsquo;s common knowledge at this point.  Wade broke the record for FT attempts in an NBA finals series, beating out Shaq in 2000, when they used the &ldquo;Hack-a-Shaq&rdquo; method to deliberately put him at the line.  Wade shot more than someone that was being constantly fouled on purpose.  Tim Donaghy spoke on this several times most notably on Rasheed Wallace and Bonzi Wells podcast, where he spills the beans.  Dirk and the Mavs really have 2 titles</p>

Sometimes your team is going to be sloppy. Tell your team to stop fouling or show me the egregious calls, because sitting there begging the question just makes you look like a sore loser who can&rsquo;t learn the lessons from their own failures.</p>

<p> It was known at the time the league wanted to fuck Cuban over for always shit talking the refs</p>

<p>Edit: This video only has some of the clips from game 6. He also never mentions how physical the Heat were allowed to be.</p>

<p>But look at the comments. People have always pointed out how one sided the officiating was in that series.</p>

<p>I only used his video because the full games are hard to find now and he’s a high profile youtuber. He confirmed that everyone back then was talking about how the Mavs got robbed.</p>

<p>Which perfectly illustrates my point even further. So thanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s well-known the refs were trying to screw over Cuban! I don&rsquo;t need to support this claim with, like, evidence or anything because it&rsquo;s so obvious! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so confident the video will reflect my opinion without even watching it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I watched that series live</p>

<p>But I’ll let you watch it all first. Let me know if you think it was fairly officiated. </p>

<p>I’ve rewatched it multiple times and have had this convo with many Heat fans pretending it wasnt that bad. We can go over the clips and I already know where this is gonna go. You’ll stop responding once I point out all the discrepancies in officiating.</p>

Because two teams do not necessarily commit the same number of fouls. Sometimes the style of one team against another means that they are more likely to get fouls called.</p>

<p>It’s not Wade’s fault that he had one of, if not the most explosive first steps in the league, pick and roll defenders were Dirk/Diop/Dampier, the floor was spaced well with shooters, and rotations were late at the rim because the Mavs were worried about giving up dunks to Shaq.</p>

<p>Cubz is a sore loser and he refuses to accept the team with the best player on the court won.</p>
