      <p>We all know the struggles the new CBA might cause on its path to hopefully achieving more parity in the NBA.
But i think a real problem is again going to be that big market teams can benefit on their soft factors for luring in players. Could the NBA maybe make keeping rosters even more beneficial by saying that players that have been rookies for their teams only count towards the approns by lets say 90%?
I think that would be a great step to encourage team identities and smart roster building whilest also giving more power to potentially suffering small market teams.</p>

<p>Obviously i myself as a rockets fan might be a bit biased on this topic but please let me know your thoughts on this or possibly other ways to address the problem.</p>

      <label for="leqb3hy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at tbh. Like the supermax is supposed to reward teams for developing home-grown guys and help them keep their own players, but the supermax is so expensive it ends up hurting your ability to build a roster, which makes it even harder to keep them after a couple years</p>

      <label for="lepgl5x" class="commentText"><p>Keeping homegrown talent in the city they were drafted and keeping teams together long term are good for individual fans, but I think the NBA is looking at how excited everyone gets every offseason when a bunch of guys change teams and taking that bump in attention as a sign of the real thing people want. Those things are pretty much directly opposed and the increased movement has the additional benefit of allowing the players to chose their path more frequently and the owners wind up having more short-term contracts and can pivot their rosters more easily.</p>

<p>I agree that the league should create exceptions for drafted talent, even if they are small. I&rsquo;m not even sure making stuff count less towards the aprons would matter as much as making supermax contracts count as max contracts against the cap and/or luxury tax. Remove some of the luxury tax issue for teams built the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; and I think you&rsquo;d still have a very competitive league with the new CBA rules.</p>

      <label for="lepiyc9" class="commentText"><p>Regarding your first point. Maybe so. Im just a random fan and obviously dont have the statistics to prove keeping teams together roughly is nicer for the viewer. I do believe that is the case and dont value offseason engagement as much but maybe that is just me</p>

<p>Totally agree with your second point though. Would also be a great approach</p>

      <label for="lepv3m6" class="commentText"><p>If you sort  by highest payroll it is Phoenix, Minnesota, Milwaukee, Memphis 1-4. Basically only Lakers with Lebron have been able to use soft support to get a free agent. The Knicks have failed at that forever, the Nets didn&rsquo;t do any better than Phoenix at recruitment. Milwaukee just got Gary Trent on a minimum.</p>

<p>The biggest markets are LA, NY, Chicago, Philly and Dallas. It is incredibly hard to argue those teams have benefitted from their market size over any team with just smart management. Essentially only the Lakers have worked that angel, maybe the Knicks but that is more super best friends factor than market size</p>

While big market teams are much more likely to get bailed out by their softfactors. As has been the case for the lakers, clippers and nets getting their teams together. Obviously for the nets and clippers that hasnt worked out due to injuries but it couldve very well have worked out.</p>

      <label for="lepdntn" class="commentText"><p>Your idea is a good one but u/Think_fast_no_faster is also right that players are circumventing that by opting in and then demanding trades while still under contract for multiple years and not just that but directing where they wanna go and freezing out other teams from their market. NBA hopes all of these recent changes grants teams more power. I think it will but not to the extent owners/GMs/NBA officials may think/want.</p>

<p>Parity already existed in the league, 6 new winners in the last 6 years in the Finals. It&rsquo;s really about attempting to control player movement more and make it more restrictive at the top but not sure that&rsquo;s gonna play out.</p>

<p>It seems like that 5th year isn&rsquo;t enough for player retention and there&rsquo;s also the downside of taking up more cap space making it harder to build a team around a star.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about having max contracts signed by the original team counting less towards the cap - I still think that&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>

<p>If players want to get their bag and run that&rsquo;s fine, but if it makes it harder for them to win elsewhere then that&rsquo;s the downside they have to take into account.</p>
