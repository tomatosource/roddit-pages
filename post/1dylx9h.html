<p>How long are they willing to wait? The East powers have, if not passed them by, widened the gap massively.</p>

<p>And I just wonder: do they start getting desperate and start kicking the tires on Brandon Ingram? I know they’re interested in Markkanen, but I don’t think they have the ammo to get him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the nba, seeds 1-3 have accounted for a whomping 97% of titles won. The only other seeds to win are 4th and 6th (one win for each). </p>

<p>My point is that complacency over a roster construction thats built for lower seeds isnt really a viable strategy for title contention in the nba whereas in the nfl its far more excusable</p>

The point I was making is that sitting pat and being content competing for a wildcard spot actually has some merit because theres not an unrealistic chance you can still win it all. Meanwhile, sitting around for a play-in spot for a shot at a title is practically a fools errand since the lowest seed to ever win was a 6th (hakeem’s rockets)</p>

<p>Not saying the sentiment is wrong but don’t think tanking for top 5 picks has actually proven a successful strategy for winning it all, let alone being the only one to work</p>

<p>Curry was 7 and easily could have gone as high as 5. Giannis and Jokic are two of the most extreme success stories in NBA history.</p>

      <label for="lc9xct8" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. Your premise is that top 5 picks will turn into a drafted player that wins FMVP, but have you considered that getting a top 5 pick isn’t just about drafting THE guy but also about drafting high end players to be used as trade assets? Lebron only returned to Cleveland in 2014 because they had #1 pick that turned into Kyrie. Then they had another #1 pick (Wiggins) that they then traded for Kevin Love which turned them into a superteam. Same shit when Lebron went to Lakers, where the Lakers had high draft picks that they traded for AD. Steph Curry at #7 also isn’t that far off from being a #5 pick. Jamal Murray isn’t the FMVP, but you can’t say that you can take him away and Nuggets still win.</p>

<p>I think at the end of the day, you still need to tank for a top pick but only because you need the assets in a trade or to get that #2 option who is arguably just as influential as the #1 because no one, not even Lebron, solos an NBA Championship. So your premise that top 5 picks aren’t that important just because no top 5 has won FMVP since Lebron is too narrow.</p>

      <label for="lcbobrk" class="commentText"><p>Before 2016 that was the way tho. There’s an entire history of the league before 2016 that proves you wrong. Both recency bias and small sample size.</p>

<p>The real answer is that basketball is only played by 5 players on the court at a time and getting a top player in those 5 guys is more important than just having 5 good guys. For recency for you, look at Luka over the wolves. But Jordan works historically.</p>

<p>Then you have to look at team location and market size. A small market team absolutely has to tank because they can’t get free agents. Would you rather live in okc or nyc? It’s not even close. Worse in the colder places apparently. That’s not even including taxes or money from endorsements outside of basketball or hollywood/ Silicon Valley.</p>

Sometimes, just because you have a successful GM who’s brought a lot of success, doesn’t mean they’re always right or that you shouldn’t bring in someone new. I mean hell, Pat Riley stepped down as coach to let Spo take over as coach.</p>

In fact, GMs didn’t want to trade with Ainge in the later years of his Celtics tenure while they all would with Brad because of how Brad was more willing to trade in good faith with other GMs so your “gotcha” isn’t really a gotcha</p>

They may have just locked themselves into a worse team without much extra means of improving it.</p>

If anything, miami is one of the smartest teams in the league and have a system they stick to.  What&rsquo;s the purpose of trading butler or someone that kills potential cap space in 2 years and doesn&rsquo;t make the team much better than they are now.  Sometimes you have to take a step back in order to take 2 steps forward.</p>

They can rapidly go from being pretty good to unplayable because they&rsquo;re constantly injured, or the injuries have robbed them of their athleticism.</p>

<p>This is a team without a future. They should consider trading Bam.</p>

<p>I happen to disagree, btw. I think they&rsquo;ve had good players and lost them. BAM and Jimmy needed Herro, and failing that, they had a great playoff run with lengthy 3-and-D players. Strus, Herro, Martin, these are still good players, they&rsquo;re just the NBA middle class on an overachieving team, not stars. The issue isn&rsquo;t only that their new teams don&rsquo;t have Spo, it&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t have the same roster to create a great zone and opportunistic offense.</p>

Dray punches Poole, it leaks and changes the locker room. Klay is upset the Warriors wouldn&rsquo;t pay him like the others and Warriors felt like they did him a favor paying 70 mil to rehab. Kerr isn&rsquo;t playing his young guys as much as he should be.</p>

<p>Clippers were becoming underdogs with hustle plays and upcoming SGA before Kawhi made the Clips trade away their entire future for another star before signing with them first. Health and consistentcy held them back a bunch as well.</p>

<p>Other teams in the league seem like they don&rsquo;t really want to trade away good players to Miami because its always a desired spot and the role players coming from them aren&rsquo;t performing as good as they were on Miami so they&rsquo;re becoming wary of it.</p>

We did Lillard last year, and cause the heat never gave a serious package, he went elsewhere and now with Golden State and Paul George where no serious package was put forward so they ended up letting him go for nothing instead of taking anything. Maybe a lesson that playing the leverage card doesn’t really work cause there will always be other suitors</p>

<p>The only one who didn’t work out was Precious and we traded him after 1 season. Ware is tbd as a rookie</p>

      <label for="lca2uao" class="commentText"><p>Bam is a year older than Tatum lol, he isn’t exactly a “young guy.” Tyler Herro is extremely injury-prone, clearly isn’t a good enough playmaker, is undersized and is a turnstile on defense. All of these guys (outside of Bam) are good role players but as a 6-man on a title contender lol. They’re basically bench players cosplaying as starters. This is what I mean by overrating role players and Tyler Herro is a dime a dozen.</p>

Miami is one of the most desirable free agent destinations, has a great coach and has a knack of developing undrafted role players. After making the finals twice in 5 years, Jimmy is coming to the end of his run, whether they let him walk or trade him for assets and expiring contracts, they will be a top destination for a free agent the minute they clear their cap. Tons of players would love to play with Bam, be coached by Spo and live in Miami.</p>

<p>The East has major question marks in the future, Bucks and 76ers are getting old and Celtics and Knicks will have very expensive rosters over the second apron and may have to dump contracts so the East could be wide open</p>

      <label for="lc9nf4r" class="commentText"><p>Riley and Spoelstra being backed in the corner reminds me of what was happening in the mid 2010’s to the Ravens.  Ozzie had had his worst stretch of drafts (2015-2017) in his 20+ years as a GM.  The Ravens were mid as shit outside of 2014 during the 2010’s so Harbaugh was under fire.</p>

<p>Luckily that went away because in 2018 (Ozzie’s last draft) they drafted Lamar Jackson.  The problem is I don’t think the Heat will be bad enough to get into the top 3 of that lotto.</p>

Would not be surprised if the heat retool without jimmy. They have really solid core team atm with many role players and a <span class="math inline">\(20mil and \)</span>50Mil (Duncan and Jimmy) contracts that might not be exercised. Only thing I hate is that the Heat didn&rsquo;t go try and get jimmy some serious help. The 2022 NBA playoffs was his best opportunity to actually win. They had a solid team that could have beat that warriors team. Just fumbled really hard against Boston.</p>

We were 3rd in the league in WAR (wins above replacement) with our injuries, we don’t know what our team is healthy yet. The walls aren’t closing, we own our future 1st round picks, we are still young to get better, Adebayo (26) Tyler (24), Jaquez (23), Jovic (21) , Ware (20).

I like the Suns and I’m not trying to be biased and I know we had high expectations but at least Beal came on a little towards the end of the year and I think they were sour on Vogel. Add on the injuries with their big 3 I wanna withhold judgement.</p>

<p>If you’re in the second apron, your roster better be perfect.</p>

      <label for="lc9qqrc" class="commentText"><p>Considering what the Heat are doing. Running an experiment with Dame over the next 3 years instead of Herro sounds like a much better situation. They don’t plan on tanking anyways, it doesn’t hurt to try it with someone who has a much higher ceiling. Herro was never gonna be that guy but Dame could at least be a dark horse as a ceiling raiser</p>
