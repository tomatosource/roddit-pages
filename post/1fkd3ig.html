      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fkd3ig/if_the_exact_same_main_mvp_criteria_were_used/"><p>If the exact same main MVP criteria were used every single year, how would the recent history of the award look? The criteria could be either the best player on the best team, the best volume stats, or the best efficiency/advanced stats, but in this hypothetical it has to remain the same every year.</p>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>For example if the award constantly had 2017-style focus on volume stats it could change races like 2019</p>

<p>Curious to see what everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;timelines&rdquo; look like in whatever reality they picked</p>

<p>Booker probably wins one (he won more games when he played than the next best team, Suns were bad without him).</p>

<p>Curry either has 3 in a row or Harden/Curry/Leonard have a different race that year.</p>

      <label for="lnv562n" class="commentText"><p>Most high performing teams have a good cast around their superstar player. One exception would be the 2009 Cavs with LeBron, but any top 3 MVP contender in the past 10 years would make the playoffs without their star. From Jokic’s Nuggets to 2017 Harden’s Rockets. Their teams are usually pretty good even without them.</p>

      <label for="lnvgtnm" class="commentText"><p>Best player on one of the best teams:</p>

<p>2017 would probably go to Kawhi because voters probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to give to Curry or KD</p>

<p>2018 would pretty easily go to Harden</p>

<p>2019 would probably go to Giannis</p>

<p>2020 would also go to Giannis</p>

<p>2021 I think would go to Embiid because I can&rsquo;t imagine voters giving the MVP to Mitchell, Gobert or CP3 and KD missed too many games.</p>

<p>2022 would probably go to Booker because Suns record is just so much better than everyone else.</p>

<p>2023 would probably go to Giannis. He was better than Tatum and the gap in records between Bucks, 76ers and Nuggets is big enough</p>

<p>2024 would go to Tatum because Celtics record is that much better.</p>

<p>I must say I prefer the way voters do it now because Jokic not having at least one MVP while Booker and Tatum have one would be weird.</p>

      <label for="lnvmafb" class="commentText"><p>2009-2016 probably stays same</p>

<p>2008 could go to Garnett because Celtics had great record, bit they also built super team, so you have to narratives clashing with each other.</p>

<p>2007 stays with Dirk</p>

<p>2006 might go to Dirk. Mavs had 3rd best record behind Pistons(4 games) and Spurs(3 games) and those teams didn&rsquo;t standout candidate like Dirk</p>

<p>1998-2005 probably stay the same</p>

<p>1997 if the emphasis really was best palyer on one of the best teams it would go to Jordan</p>

<p>1990-1996 stays the same</p>

<p>1989 stays with magic. Pistons had the best record by good margin, but in the real voting both Dumars and Isiah only got 1 point each and I can&rsquo;t see them overturning such a deficit</p>

<p>1988 is tough. It would probably go to Bird eventhough Lakers have better record by 5 games because this was a bit of a off season for Magic compared to his previous 2</p>

<p>1983-1987 would stay the same</p>

<p>1982 would go to Bird because they had decent win advantage and Bird finished 2nd in the real voting anyway</p>

<p>1980 and 1981 would stay the same and I&rsquo;m not even going to attepmt to going further back bevmcause I spent enlugh time kn something no one else is going to read.</p>
