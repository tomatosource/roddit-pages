      <label for="l9bdxrl" class="commentText"><p>This just makes me appreciate my mom&rsquo;s cousin even more. She was diagnosed with Lupus at age 17 and had to go to dialysis <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> times a week, every week for the rest of her life. But she would have never let you guess what she was going through for the longest time. Every time we went to South Carolina or her and her sister+mom would come to Florida she would participate in every activity even on dialysis days. Whether it was going to the beach, going in the pool, going to Disney/Universal, or even just having fun at home she was the life of the party. It wasn&rsquo;t until around <sup>2015</sup>&frasl;<sub>2016</sub> that she started slowing down and needing more rest on her dialysis days but she would still try her hardest to be who she was before. She passed at 42 during 2021 due to complications with covid, and it honestly hit our whole family like a ton of bricks. Especially her mother, who couldn&rsquo;t even say goodbye to her daughter due to also being in the hospital with covid complications. I think deep down we all knew that this was how it would end, but covid sped everything up. We thought we had at least another 10 yrs with how she had fought all her life.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post, just whenever people bring up dialysis I always get a flood of memories and emotions of my cousin Jennifer. She was the strongest and bravest woman I have ever had the privilege to have in my life and she will always be an inspiration to me. Rest in Piece Jen-bro, I hope you got that fat blunt in your hand while sitting in a chair on the beach with your toes in the sand like you always loved.</p>

In one episode he is kidnapped by a guy who pretends to take out his kidneys in order to convince him to go on a robbery spree to buy them back. When Dewey is cornered by the main character, US Marshal Raylan Givens, Raylan convinces him to take a piss and if he takes a piss he still has two good kidneys. The piss is successful, but not realizing that he never had any kidneys removed, a perplexed Dewey asks &lsquo;You mean i had four kidneys?&rsquo;</p>

<p>One of my best friends i used to watch Justified with is currently on dialysis and i send him dewey crowe gifs all the time.</p>

<p>I got my Kidney 09/2015. I had a congenital kidney disease that caused function to progressively decline.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to get one from my dad a couple of months after graduating from college, prior to having to go on extensive dialysis.</p>

<p>My creatinine at the time was in the 5s, and eGFR had been pretty bad.</p>

<p>It’s been nearly 9 years.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty healthy. The prednisone weight gain is no joke, but I’m living healthier now. Creatinine was 1.14 at my last visit. I go for a monthly infusion of Belatacept for anti-rejection, along with very low dose prednisone.</p>

<p>I’ve had a couple of minor infections from sports injuries turn into 2-day hospital stays and I’ve had COVID twice from work trips. Overall I’m great, healthy, and knock on wood the kidney is still kicking. I hope to get a good 20+ out of it.</p>

<p>Like I said, always happy to chat if you guys have questions.</p>

      <label for="l9axycb" class="commentText"><p>Thanks friend. My son’s creatinine was over 5. And eGRF down to about 12. We did the transplant before dialysis and his sister was a 10 for 10 genetic match. Our concern is his cause was IGA nephropathy. You see, he was on Remicade for 10 years dealing with another autoimmune disease, but he’s off it now for about 8 years. There is new research showing a connection between Remicade and IGA disease. So now with being off Remicade and on immune system suppressants, there is no sign of IGA in his new kidney. So we are quite hopeful. He just had his 2 year biopsy and it was perfect. His eGFR is stable at about 1.6. The only issue is he is now so healthy, he’s gained too much weight (appetite back) and they want him to diet. Talk about a champagne problem.</p>

<p>For you and my son, there will be so many new options in the next decade, I think the future looks great. Stem cell grown kidneys, mechanical kidneys, xenotransplants …. So many new options. And you and my son have good matching family kidneys….we are also hoping for 20+ years.</p>

<p>On a side note, I wanted to be the donator for my son. But I was already 60, and they wanted an age match. And my daughter, who was already 30, told me to shut the hell up and let her do it. I then realized as a parent you are not always in control lol. Always remember, your Dad may have gifted you a kidney, but you also gave your Dad a great gift - the opportunity to sacrifice for a son or daughter. I am sure he didn’t even have a second thought about doing this for you…it’s an honor I wish I had.</p>

<p>Take care and stay healthy. Thanks for sharing…….</p>

      <label for="l9b31aa" class="commentText"><p>That’s great to hear about being such a great match and how he’s doing.</p>

<p>The appetite thing is tough. I went from 5’10 195 to 5’10 255 in the first 3 years after transplant. I could literally eat a 4 course meal then feel starved still.</p>

<p>I’m down to 230 in the last 18 months and trending down. It’s a constant battle honestly.</p>

<p>I do hope we see advances continue as far as mechanical kidney, even if it functions like an LVAD and provided continued dialysis without the need for a full hookup.</p>

<p>Best of luck to you guys and I hope you’re very proud of both of your kids. They sound like awesome siblings to one another!</p>

      <label for="l9b5ov6" class="commentText"><p>My son has gained 45 pounds in 2 years. Yeah he loves being healthy and hungry! And losing weight is a challenge and not just for recent transplant patients. I swear our food industry is trying to kill us all.</p>

<p>Regarding mechanical kidneys, don’t think of it as a miniature dialysis machine. There are researchers that are closing in on creating a miniaturized filter system that is far beyond dialysis. I think there really is promise.</p>

<p>And thanks for the mention of my kids. They are great and my daughter made a huge sacrifice, considering she has (2) young children. Her husband was supportive, but crazy scared as well. She is doing great.</p>

<p>Now, I just noticed your Celtics flare. My Dad played in the NBL (pre-NBA) and was always a huge Celtics fan. But he moved us to Detroit where I became a huge Pistons fan and I was going to a lot of games in the 80’s. We had a lot of good-natured arguments. So in closing, congratulations on the chip and I hate your guts now!</p>

<p>DURING HIS NBA days, from 2005 to 2015, the signs were there. While he played for the Knicks in his first five seasons, team doctors warned him about his high blood pressure. (Diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney disease.) Robinson said they went so far as to try to stop him from playing if his pressure was too high. He started telling them to stop checking, because he’d play regardless of their prognosis. He was officially diagnosed with kidney disease in 2006, and he’d check into hospitals on the days when his body would crash, often passing out from dehydration and incessant vomiting, only to come out feeling good as new and proceeding with business as usual. The warnings from the doctors that his kidney function was declining, that they would likely fail in his 30s, were something he didn’t believe.</p>

He was a tiny athletic freak (compared to the nba, he’s a normal sized athletic freak to us regular folk). His days in the nba were always numbered.</p>

<p>Plenty of athletes destroy their body for money and glory. Shit, most UFC fighters do it for damn near free. They will make less in their career than an nfl player does in one season.</p>

<p>In 2018, however, Robinson’s kidneys failed. When this happens, they aren’t able to remove waste and extra fluid from the blood on their own or regulate bodily chemicals, which can be fatal. He delayed treatment, intent on living life on his own terms.</p>

<p>They did say that he started taking BP meds at some point in his NBA career, but either the damage was already done or something else was going on that continued to make it worse.</p>

      <label for="l9chpq2" class="commentText"><p>Bro some UFC fighters are making only 12k/12k. And that’s if they win. Otherwise it’s just 12k. They have to pay their coaches, agents, nutritionist, trainers etc out of pocket. The UFC will only pay travel for the fighter and one coach. Anyone extra is the fighters responsibility. Guys most likely LOSE money doing that shit. And that’s the highest level of fighting. Belabor has guys making 5k/5k. Regional promotions have guys making $500. Keljin Blevins is richer than all but the very top UFC fighters.</p>

His fistula was in rough shape and kept leaking during treatment more and more frequently.  Got a live donor kidney and it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s his old self again.  Still has to regain a lot of his strength and endurance and his health problems have aged him quite a bit, but he&rsquo;s alive.  What&rsquo;s more, his mind is no longer clouded by toxins and metabolic waste.</p>

      <label for="l99hyh7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the reality is that even &ldquo;deceased&rdquo; donors cannot be dead for very long. Donation has to happen in an extremely controlled environment. One blood flow stops, organs are only &ldquo;good&rdquo; for a few minutes. Kidneys are relatively resilient, and, surgically, the most simple to get to. So they are the easiest to transplant. But the patient still has to die in the OR for the kidney to be viable. It&rsquo;s not like an ambulance can bring in someone whose heart stopped beating an hour ago, and then the docs can transplant those organs. That&rsquo;s not the way it works. It all has to be super controlled. That&rsquo;s why the numbers look like they do. ~3 million people die every year. But there were only 25k transplanted organs. And that means there were way less than 25k donors, as one donor can potentially donate like 5 organs. Shits hard. But the technology is wild and changing rapidly. If you&rsquo;re interested Google &ldquo;heart in a box&rdquo; to see some truly insane stuff.</p>

They knew what her kidney health was, whether donating would unduly impact her health, whether she was donating under her own volition or was coerced, whether she was a match, and a whole score of other things.  They are very thorough.</p>

<p>Being a match isn&rsquo;t really required to donate, though.  I can donate a kidney for you regardless.  If it isn&rsquo;t a match, the kidney goes to someone else and you get the very next available kidney that you are a match for.  It puts you at the top of the kidney recipient list regardless of where you were in the order beforehand.</p>

If you aren&rsquo;t a match, that kidney goes to someone else and the person you donated for is instantly put to the top of the donor list and receives the next available kidney they are compatible for.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much an exact kidney match correlates with different races but I had an American friend of South Asian descent who donated to a stranger; he initially was cheek swabbed and added to the database at a South Asian cultural gathering and they were saying that that community/population had a really hard time getting matches and they wanted to get people added to the database for that reason.</p>

<p>Edit: my bad I forgot my friend did a stem cell transplant and not a kidney transplant; much less extreme and perhaps different dynamics at play</p>

      <label for="l9bxdeg" class="commentText"><p>Iran has a government program where their citizens can sell their organs for money and due to that, they have basically no waitlist for people who need an organ transplant. That brings into the question if it is ethical for our government to approve of such a policy. The reason it works in Iran is because the general population is relatively poor. Doing that here will bring a huge frenzy in the media and medical boards since most likely, impoverished people will sign up to donate their organs.</p>

<p>This is called &ldquo;plundering of the peasant&rsquo;s parts for profits&rdquo; (nice alliteration btw) - the exploitation of the poor and ignorant, especially in impoverished third-world countries. People living in extreme poverty are often desperate and ill-informed. Even with informed consent, it&rsquo;s obvious it would be mainly the wealthy taking from the poor.</p>

      <label for="l98b6tv" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m literally a doctor lol. You can&rsquo;t just put in any organ into your body it doesn&rsquo;t work like that. These organ donation processes are so complex and involve so many people and are time sensitive. You can&rsquo;t just stock organs on a &ldquo;black market&rdquo; and have people come get them any time, this isn&rsquo;t Fallout. Organs go bad extremely fast and the odds that the organ this &ldquo;black market&rdquo; would be match your body would essentially be zero. And that&rsquo;s not even addressing you have no licensed, competent doctors, nurses, OR staff taking care of you. Nobody is gonna risk their license and prison time to help you transplant a black market organ</p>

Many doctors, at least in the US, follow ethics to a T and you would have to search long and hard for someone who doesn&rsquo;t care (hint: surgeons are probably the biggest egomaniacs out there)</p>

Typically, when a patient has shown a pattern of neglect, they&rsquo;re denied transplant. Similar thing happened to a family member of mine.</p>

<p>They had a 20 year history of liver related doctors visits and never followed through on medical recommendations. Ended up in critical care, denied a transplant at 59 years old, and died at 63.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s people out there that catch it early, follow through on all doctors orders, and do everything they can to give themselves a chance. They get first dibs.</p>

      <label for="l99fa4w" class="commentText"><p>Kidneys are also a lot easier to come by. Kidneys are by far the most transplanted organ. For reference, more than half of all organ transplants last year were kidneys. There were ~25,000 kidney transplants last year and ~10,000 liver transplants. Every year there are more transplants, as &ldquo;procurement&rdquo; methods improve. So &ldquo;listing&rdquo; gets less strict. He&rsquo;s young. Hopefully has learned that BP control is important. I would bet he gets a kidney and lives a long life.</p>

<p>15% kidney function is considered kidney failure. Since he’s not over 75, or even close to, and assuming he’s in relatively good shape, he could easily live for a decade, if not decades, on dialysis if he follows his doctors recommendations.</p>

<p>Obviously this is all relative to himself. But it sounds hyperbolic.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think most people in the US have a their &lsquo;kidney guy&rsquo; in their phone book.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s before even considering it&rsquo;s a pretty ethically disgusting act to engage in that will make many people feel bad to even consider.</p>

<p>Yes, I called him a sheep.  I think it&rsquo;s sad and pathetic that when certain ideologies are called out or called into question, &ldquo;certain&rdquo; people instantly resort to &ldquo;Trump is bad, you must love Trump&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s sheep mentality. He doesn&rsquo;t know shit about me and my political preferences. He heard something he didn&rsquo;t like and instantly went to the easiest, laziest comeback possible with the Trump stuff and the incel stuff.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m an idiot, but what does that make Mr. College over there? A word I can&rsquo;t use without snowflakes banning me. (Ooh look, I just used a Republican saying, therefore I must be a Republican / Trumper / Evangelist!)</p>

<p>My disdain for the educational system does not stem from being an uneducated dumbass, no.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say what I want to say here or I&rsquo;ll get banned, because people rather censor, ban, make fun of, put down, etc.  than have real conversations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll end on this note since every loser pining to downvote me thinks I&rsquo;m some hardcore Republican:</p>

<p>Both political parties are absolute garbage and the party system should be abolished for what they&rsquo;ve done to this Country.</p>

<p>Trump and Biden are the best our nation has to offer? Really?</p>

<p>Political Tribalism is the epitome of stupidity and holds us all back.</p>

<p>Alright kids, downvote this response into oblivion because it was too many words to read.. I&rsquo;m done here.</p>

If you read the article, he had a team of world class medical folks begging him to get his blood pressure under control. They warned him of this exact scenario. And he chose to ignore them. He straight up says he thought he was invincible and would never get sick. That&rsquo;s just foolish. And unfortunately he is now paying price for choosing to ignore medical advise over and over and over. Despite having access to amazing docs, and despite being overtly symptomatic.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll probably be on dialysis for a while and then get a kidney and live a long life.</p>
