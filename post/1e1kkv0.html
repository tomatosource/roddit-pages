They weren’t gonna add another ball dominate small guard and the Nets blew it up. The 76ers had Maxie turn into a near all NBA guy too on a much cheaper deal. Where was Mitchell going again for that kind of money?</p>

      <label for="lcv63s1" class="commentText"><p>The difference is if he asks out now we have more years under his deal so our return would be way better than it would if he didn’t sign an extension. Most media heads not only expected Donovan to leave before signing an extension but said we should’ve traded him last offseason to get assets back. Now we have him longer and can get more from him if he decides he doesn’t wanna be here (which by all accounts he does people just cant fathom it because it’s Cleveland, as if NBA players don’t all spend their offseason in LA or New York anyway.</p>

I think they said maybe Lakers but I don’t remember a ton of other options because of the cap. They maintained he wanted out but as the season progressed kind of couldn’t figure out where he landed and knew he wanted max dollars.</p>

      <label for="lcv1vsm" class="commentText"><p>No, the standard for journalists is to substantiate your claims. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an airtight prediction that&rsquo;s certain to come true, but it should be based on something you can identify. Simmons consistently falls short of that standard and makes broad statements that aren&rsquo;t tied to any source of information he bothers to identify.</p>

<p>We have decades of evidence that the media can inform people by relying on credible sources of information and trying to be as transparent as possible about those sources. It&rsquo;s not a choice between Bill Simmons&rsquo;s bloviating and regurgitating press releases.</p>

<p>Also, the idea that people consume NBA media to &ldquo;get an idea of what might happen in the future,&rdquo; and in doing so rely on a process that &ldquo;inherently means inaccuracy&rdquo; is self-defeating. Why would people who want to know what could happen rely on an inherently inaccurate process?</p>

<p>Where is this happening? What field of media is there where journalists are constantly outing their sources? A lot of the time these sources are kept anonymous because they <em>want</em> to be anonymous and they would be angry at the journalist if they were outed (see: the KOC/Calvin Booth drama from earlier this year).</p>

<p>This is a very strange question. Do you have an example of a process that gives people insight about the future that isn&rsquo;t inherently inaccurate?</p>

      <label for="lcv4z64" class="commentText"><p>The beginning of your comment answers your final question. You ask if I have an example of a process that gives people insights that isn&rsquo;t inherently inaccurate. Yes: Journalism that relies on reliable sources of information and seeks to provide readers with the maximum transparency regarding the sourcing is a process that tends to inform people and tends to be accurate.</p>

<p>To more directly apply that to the Donovan Mitchell situation: If people listened less to Bill Simmons and more to someone like Brian Windhorst, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so surprised that Mitchell stayed.</p>

<p>You ask about journalists &ldquo;constantly outing their sources,&rdquo; which seems to be an attempt to distract from my entirely correct point about transparency in sourcing. But if you sincerely are curious about industry standards for journalists, I&rsquo;d point you to the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics, which says, among other things: &ldquo;Identify sources clearly. The public is entitled to as much information as possible to judge the reliability and motivations of sources.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that many media outlets increasingly ignore the SPJ guidelines and are richly rewarded for doing so. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not a longstanding standard. Simmons taking the L on Mitchell staying with the Cavs is a good reminder that media consumers aren&rsquo;t actually well served by those cutting corners on reporting and transparency.</p>

<p>Windhost does the &ldquo;little birdy told me&rdquo; thing you&rsquo;re complaining about all the time.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Can you give a concrete example of how you have &ldquo;transparency in sourcing&rdquo; without being transparent about who your sources are? I don&rsquo;t really see how you can report information on background (which is essentially what Simmons is doing when he says that everyone around the league thought Mitchell was going to leave) and have &ldquo;transparency in sourcing.&rdquo;</p>

The second apron is actually kind of stupid and there should be a way where every team gets to discount their own drafted players against the cap. Not just the Celtics but everyone obviously. Klay, Curry and Dray should count at 50 percent of the cap. Ditto Luka, Giannis, Embiid, Maxie, Bam, Trae, Blake on the Clippers etc.</p>

<p>That said he argued it fucking terribly with Russillo so I’d agree there. Just like terrible logic that made it sound like a homer take.</p>

To quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a look at some of the notable national writers and analysts who at one time claimed that Mitchell was not going to re-sign with the Cavs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Perk, SAS, and Bontemps, I think the writer has a valid argument. All three suggested Mitchell wouldn&rsquo;t resign and none of them (as far as the article outlines it) have admitted their opinions were wrong since his signing.</p>

<p>For Simmons, he claimed Mitchell potentially leaving Cleveland was &ldquo;probably the worst kept secret in the league.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t some black and white statement that Simmons thinks for sure he won&rsquo;t resign. And then, Simmons does a mea culpa after Mitchell resigns outlining why NYK and BRK didn&rsquo;t make sense for Mitchell and that, yes, Simmons was willing to take the loss on this one. So now this article is shoveling dirt on Simmons when he was pretty levelheaded about the situation and then later admitted he was wrong? At best this is an unjust argument from the writer.</p>

<p>And then for the last two, Pincus and Beck, the writer is completely missing the boat. These two cited sources, in Beck&rsquo;s case an eastern conference executive, that Mitchell was likely to leave. Again, Pincus and Beck aren&rsquo;t saying themselves that Mitchell will leave, <strong>they are citing sources that are saying he is likely to leave.</strong> Why does this matter? Because the whole point of this article is to call out media members who claimed Mitchell wasn&rsquo;t going to resign with the Cavs. <strong>But neither Pincus nor Beck are saying that themselves, they are passing along information from league sources who are saying that.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not some national media apologist. A lot of times they&rsquo;re wrong and a lot of times they don&rsquo;t admit it later. The &ldquo;Mitchell is definitely leaving&rdquo; talk was overblown. But this article, specifically the Pincus and Beck argument, is totally misguided, petty, and frankly inaccurate.</p>

<p>reporting it was a done deal despite not having a source that would go on record</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, sources are never on record for this sort of thing. The NBA is a relationship-based organization, nobody is going to jeopardize their relationship with a player or FO just to help add a little credibility to a report.</p>

<p>Secondly, how many of them actually said it was a done deal? I&rsquo;ll give you Perkins and Bontemps, but who else? SImmons and Smith both advanced a theory about Mitchell wanting to go to the Knicks, but at least according to Simmons, the Knicks chose an option that made a Mitchell move impossible. Maybe they were correct that Mitchell <em>wanted</em> to go to the Knicks, but it simply wasn&rsquo;t possible. Pincus and Beck simply said that people in the league thought Mitchell was leaving. If those people were wrong, it&rsquo;s not on Pincus and Beck for accurately reporting on league-wide speculation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I never said that talking heads should be &ldquo;immune from criticism.&rdquo; But if you take everything that NBA talking heads say at face value and then get mad that something they said ended up not being true, you kinda set yourself up to get mad.</p>

<p>(And I don&rsquo;t think that the Mitchell leaving rumors were &ldquo;bullshit.&rdquo; I think the chance of him leaving was very real even if it ended up not happening.)</p>

<p>That really isn’t the point any way. When bullshit is being shoved  down your throat for 2 years, it becomes annoying. So when it doesn’t happen, of course  you’re eager to point it out.</p>

<p>I’m sure lakers fans would be totally silent if the shoe was on the other foot lol.</p>
