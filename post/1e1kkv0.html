Everyone thought the blazers were forced to send him to Miami because that’s what the media said he wanted. Instead they waited for a better offer to come and sent him to us. With trades like the Kd and harden trades the teams did get forced to take a worse offer to trade the star where they want. Now that dame was the most recent superstar traded, hopefully that sets a precedent that the teams don’t have to follow whatever their star wants.</p>

It’s similar to agents creating storylines to get teams to not draft their clients, or even directly just telling teams not to draft them. The team will do what’s best for the team. They do not care what the media and Adam silver want.</p>

Reports are that he may have spent time with LeBron – both of them being NBA players and they do share similar DNA as both are human beings – and, who knows what they might have discussed if that happened. I can imagine Giannis has probably been a fan of some of the things JJ Reddick has said on his podcast, and I can talk about a bunch of other inconclusive speculation and stretch that all out a whole lot as coverage of this non-topic continues. Perhaps Rob Pelinka can work out a deal with Milwaukee for Austin Reaves.”</p>

Which is in reality just LeBron&rsquo;s team hopping and the last Nets big 3. KD to GSW was ring chasing and Kawhi/PG just went home to LAC.</p>

<p>The same shit why you constantly heard about Zion only wanting to play in NY for the Knicks from the moment he got drafted to the point he was eligible for extension. For him to just extend in NOLA. Because players don&rsquo;t care, especially not the younger generations and especially not the foreigners: big market vs small market is an exclusively American thing.</p>

No club in London is going to be a favourable destination over Liverpool or Manchester, just because they play in London. No player is going to play for a team in Berlin over Dortmund, just because they are in Berlin.</p>

<p>The city of a team is not relevant as it is made out to be in US sports. Biggest clubs don&rsquo;t necessarily means coming from the biggest cities or vice versa. Big clubs that are from big cities comes from a historical precedent that hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with media coverage either: local recruitment, which dates back to the same early days as the MLB.</p>

<p>You are more likely to find more talent to build around and grow as a club when you are in a major city than in a rural area.</p>

They weren’t gonna add another ball dominate small guard and the Nets blew it up. The 76ers had Maxie turn into a near all NBA guy too on a much cheaper deal. Where was Mitchell going again for that kind of money?</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re cap is at 170M this year (not including any new players they just signed e.g Lowry) and it&rsquo;s 180M THE YEAR AFTER LOL</p>

<p>Smh they could have easily landed a big FA in the past two years without them on the books SAD</p>

<p>Why though? There were never any actual reports from credible reporters that he wanted out. Just a ton of speculation that he might, that was seemingly not actually based on anything he said, even off the record. The closest thing we got to an actual report was speculation from &ldquo;league executives,&rdquo; meaning people not actually affiliated with the Cavs or Mitchell in any way.</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an airtight prediction that&rsquo;s certain to come true, but it should be based on something you can identify. Simmons consistently falls short of that standard and makes broad statements that aren&rsquo;t tied to any source of information he bothers to identify.</p>

<p>We have decades of evidence that the media can inform people by relying on credible sources of information and trying to be as transparent as possible about those sources. It&rsquo;s not a choice between Bill Simmons&rsquo;s bloviating and regurgitating press releases.</p>

<p>Also, the idea that people consume NBA media to &ldquo;get an idea of what might happen in the future,&rdquo; and in doing so rely on a process that &ldquo;inherently means inaccuracy&rdquo; is self-defeating.

<p>Where is this happening? What field of media is there where journalists are constantly outing their sources? A lot of the time these sources are kept anonymous because they <em>want</em> to be anonymous and they would be angry at the journalist if they were outed (see: the KOC/Calvin Booth drama from earlier this year).</p>

<p>This is a very strange question. Do you have an example of a process that gives people insight about the future that isn&rsquo;t inherently inaccurate?</p>

      <label for="lcv4z64" class="commentText"><p>The beginning of your comment answers your final question. You ask if I have an example of a process that gives people insights that isn&rsquo;t inherently inaccurate. Yes: Journalism that relies on reliable sources of information and seeks to provide readers with the maximum transparency regarding the sourcing is a process that tends to inform people and tends to be accurate.</p>

<p>To more directly apply that to the Donovan Mitchell situation: If people listened less to Bill Simmons and more to someone like Brian Windhorst, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so surprised that Mitchell stayed.</p>

<p>You ask about journalists &ldquo;constantly outing their sources,&rdquo; which seems to be an attempt to distract from my entirely correct point about transparency in sourcing. But if you sincerely are curious about industry standards for journalists, I&rsquo;d point you to the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics, which says, among other things: &ldquo;Identify sources clearly. The public is entitled to as much information as possible to judge the reliability and motivations of sources.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that many media outlets increasingly ignore the SPJ guidelines and are richly rewarded for doing so. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not a longstanding standard. Simmons taking the L on Mitchell staying with the Cavs is a good reminder that media consumers aren&rsquo;t actually well served by those cutting corners on reporting and transparency.</p>

<p>Windhost does the &ldquo;little birdy told me&rdquo; thing you&rsquo;re complaining about all the time.</p>

<p>Can you give a concrete example of how you have &ldquo;transparency in sourcing&rdquo; without being transparent about who your sources are? I don&rsquo;t really see how you can report information on background (which is essentially what Simmons is doing when he says that everyone around the league thought Mitchell was going to leave) and have &ldquo;transparency in sourcing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to force you to consume more accurate media! If you want to be misinformed for entertainment value, you&rsquo;ve gone to the right place with Simmons. I don&rsquo;t begrudge you that - it&rsquo;s just basketball. My original point was that Simmons was wrong, and his &ldquo;circumstances change&rdquo; excuse doesn&rsquo;t change that. There&rsquo;s no need for you to go down a rabbit hole.</p>

      <label for="lcvmj57" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;It would have been nice&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean he always wanted to be in several other places. Those two statements are not the same.</p>

<p>This is a good example of how Simmons makes claims that are so broad, so divorced from any specific pieces of evidence, that people assume there&rsquo;s more substance than there really is.</p>

<p>Imagine Simmons had said, &lsquo;Donovan Mitchell said in 2022 that it would have been nice to play in New York. I think that means he still wants to go there. I think it means the reports that said he was thrilled to end up in Cleveland were false. I think those comments mean he&rsquo;ll inevitably leave Cleveland.&rdquo; You&rsquo;d probably think, &ldquo;Well, that seems like a stretch, although I see where you&rsquo;re coming from.&rdquo; You&rsquo;d be able to decide how reliable the narrator is.</p>

<p>Instead, Simmons said, &ldquo;Mitchell not staying there long-term is probably the worst-kept secret in the league.&rdquo; What does that mean? It implies a bunch of people have told him Mitchell will leave. But he doesn&rsquo;t actually say how many people, if they&rsquo;ve heard directly from Mitchell, if they&rsquo;re affiliated with the Cavs or the Knicks, etc. Is he reporting that it&rsquo;s a widely held expectation, or that Mitchell has specifically made that decision?</p>

<p>If you hear broad statements like &ldquo;everybody knows this will happen,&rdquo; and you don&rsquo;t bother asking for any specifics, you get misled. And you end up on reddit, insisting that Bill Simmons couldn&rsquo;t have been entirely wrong, even when he was.</p>

<p>If Simmons meant to say, &ldquo;I think Mitchell probably wants to leave because XYZ,&rdquo; he could have. But he said that Mitchell leaving was the worst kept secret in the NBA. It&rsquo;s wild so many people on this thread are so determined to claim Bill Simmons wasn&rsquo;t wrong. The man shoots from the hip. It&rsquo;s not surprising when he misses.</p>

Klay, Curry and Dray should count at 50 percent of the cap. Ditto Luka, Giannis, Embiid, Maxie, Bam, Trae, Blake on the Clippers etc.</p>

<p>That said he argued it fucking terribly with Russillo so I’d agree there. Just like terrible logic that made it sound like a homer take.</p>

      <label for="lcvs9lp" class="commentText"><p>Any player &ldquo;can&rdquo; probably force his way out if they are willing to be disruptive, but he isn&rsquo;t anywhere close to Durant&rsquo;s level. More importantly, the new CBA is going to change how tradeable max contracts are. First apron teams are limited on how much they take back in trades. Second apron teams cannot aggregate salaries.</p>

<p>Several recent trades from last year including the Lillard trade and both the Porzingis and Holiday to Boston trades would not have been possible under the new rules. As of today, four teams are over the second apron, three more are over the first, and of the remaining 23 teams, 15 are hardcapped with 12 at the first apron and 3 at the second. Denver is both over the first apron and hardcapped at the second.</p>

<p>That is probably going to be the norm going forward. Unless he is willing to go be the best player on a rebuilding team, there are not going to be a ton of options.</p>

      <label for="lcuzhd2" class="commentText"><p>This article has a lot of flaws. The point of this article is to call out, by name, six national media guys for their wrong opinion that Mitchell wouldn&rsquo;t resign with the Cavs. Ok, I think there&rsquo;s value in holding media members accountable for their opinions when they turn out to be incorrect. To quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a look at some of the notable national writers and analysts who at one time claimed that Mitchell was not going to re-sign with the Cavs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Perk, SAS, and Bontemps, I think the writer has a valid argument. All three suggested Mitchell wouldn&rsquo;t resign and none of them (as far as the article outlines it) have admitted their opinions were wrong since his signing.</p>

<p>For Simmons, he claimed Mitchell potentially leaving Cleveland was &ldquo;probably the worst kept secret in the league.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t some black and white statement that Simmons thinks for sure he won&rsquo;t resign. And then, Simmons does a mea culpa after Mitchell resigns outlining why NYK and BRK didn&rsquo;t make sense for Mitchell and that, yes, Simmons was willing to take the loss on this one. So now this article is shoveling dirt on Simmons when he was pretty levelheaded about the situation and then later admitted he was wrong? At best this is an unjust argument from the writer.</p>

<p>And then for the last two, Pincus and Beck, the writer is completely missing the boat. These two cited sources, in Beck&rsquo;s case an eastern conference executive, that Mitchell was likely to leave. Again, Pincus and Beck aren&rsquo;t saying themselves that Mitchell will leave, <strong>they are citing sources that are saying he is likely to leave.</strong> Why does this matter? Because the whole point of this article is to call out media members who claimed Mitchell wasn&rsquo;t going to resign with the Cavs. <strong>But neither Pincus nor Beck are saying that themselves, they are passing along information from league sources who are saying that.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not some national media apologist. A lot of times they&rsquo;re wrong and a lot of times they don&rsquo;t admit it later. The &ldquo;Mitchell is definitely leaving&rdquo; talk was overblown. But this article, specifically the Pincus and Beck argument, is totally misguided, petty, and frankly inaccurate.</p>

      <label for="lcva97r" class="commentText"><p>Here’s the thing though.  If you’re Beck, you can absolutely find a random exec to say he’s leaving in order to generate your own clicks.  Did he ask 5 execs and one said yes?  Idk.   It’s a gray area of reporting.</p>

<p>And for Simmons, I get he took the L but that doesn’t change the fact that he was likely (at worst) making shit up or (at best) dramatically stretching any inside whispers.  “Worst kept secret” means it’s damn near a done deal.  We haven’t seen anything anywhere else to even remotely suggest that was true, from Don, his camp, his friends, etc.  My guess is he latched on to a few folks saying he’d leave and ignore all the others saying he wouldn’t (of which there were plenty on the latter)</p>

      <label for="lcvnt5j" class="commentText"><p>For Beck, I agree that a quote from an anonymous exec needs to be taken with a healthy grain of salt because the rival exec could have ulterior motives. I also don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s irresponsible of Beck to quote this anonymous exec because I think it&rsquo;s notable and worth mentioning in a story. My issue here is not with Beck, it&rsquo;s with the writer of this article who is attributing the opinion that Mitchell will leave to Beck, when it&rsquo;s not Beck&rsquo;s opinion, it&rsquo;s the exec&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>For Simmons, you&rsquo;re probably right that he was probably stretching inside whispers and jumping to his own conclusion. But it&rsquo;s his job to give his opinion on this stuff based on who he&rsquo;s talked to and what he&rsquo;s heard, and his best guess at the start of the season was that Mitchell was going to leave. That turned out to be wrong 9 months later, but Simmons admitted he was wrong and gave some coherent reasons why the circumstances changed over those 9 months. Could you say Simmons was irresponsible in his representation of the situation at the start of the season? I personally don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that out of line, but sure. Is it just to call him out in this article that he was wrong after he already admitted he was wrong? I don&rsquo;t see what purpose this serves other than being petty/driving clicks of his own, which is again where I take issue with the writer of this article.</p>

      <label for="lcvx9eb" class="commentText"><p>For Beck, context on that stuff is important. In positive he didn’t hear from one exec and then never discussed Mitchell again.</p>

<p>Let’s say it played out like</p>

<ul>
<li>Exec 1 - He seems happy, probably staying</li>
<li>Exec 2 - I have no idea</li>
<li>Source 3 - Extending is most likely</li>
<li>Source 4 - Who knows, will be hard to find a better situation</li>
<li>Exec 5 - I think he’s gone</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course you can then write a story quoting anonymous exec that he’s leaving and be factually correct…</p>

<p>Nothing, but the new CBA is going to make it a lot harder for good teams to acquire guys already signed to max contracts. While he may want out, the destinations might be rather limited.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, sources are never on record for this sort of thing. The NBA is a relationship-based organization, nobody is going to jeopardize their relationship with a player or FO just to help add a little credibility to a report.</p>

<p>Secondly, how many of them actually said it was a done deal? I&rsquo;ll give you Perkins and Bontemps, but who else? SImmons and Smith both advanced a theory about Mitchell wanting to go to the Knicks, but at least according to Simmons, the Knicks chose an option that made a Mitchell move impossible. Maybe they were correct that Mitchell <em>wanted</em> to go to the Knicks, but it simply wasn&rsquo;t possible. Pincus and Beck simply said that people in the league thought Mitchell was leaving. If those people were wrong, it&rsquo;s not on Pincus and Beck for accurately reporting on league-wide speculation.</p>

They weren’t wrong because Donovan loves Cleveland and is happy with the situation or because they just made it up, they were wrong because every other possible alternative dried up.</p>

Trade makes it easier for a team that wants him to get him opposed to having to have the cap space ready to sign him, Cleveland will now get pieces back instead of losing him for nothing, and he gets his yearly money either way. Made sense for everyone to do this even if both sides have agreed to get him somewhere else he wants by next summer </p>

<p>Shit changes fast in the current NBA. We could be living in a timeline where he wanted out, shit changed, he decided to stay, and then he decides in a month or so he actually wants out and demands a trade. Wouldn&rsquo;t be doing a victory lap just yet if I was Cleveland</p>

      <label for="lcwgti3" class="commentText"><p>Thinking lately about how in divorces, one partner will say something about how they&rsquo;re unhappy with the relationship and the situation, and the other partner will hear it as, &ldquo;why are you saying I&rsquo;m unworthy of love?&rdquo; which is a very different question.</p>

<p>Anyway this is small market sports fandom.</p>

<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t personally believe that big market reporters, for the most part, are making stuff up about these poor basketball players. I think sports fans should be as skeptical of reports saying &ldquo;he denies the rumors&rdquo; as they are of reports saying someone wants to leave.</p>

<p>Players lie. There are so many smoke screens, PR teams leaking trial balloons, rival teams trying to bluff interest. Look at all the examples of players lying that they want to stay right before they leave.</p>

<p>One notable example includes Donovan Mitchell himself, when he was leaving the Jazz. That playbook was the same, in which it was an &ldquo;open secret&rdquo; he wanted to leave. Mitchell directly was asked if he wants to stay in Utah and he said, &ldquo;Yes&hellip;this hurts Sarah, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie. But yeah, I do.&rdquo; And then he was gone, and afterward he said he very much wanted out of Utah and felt very uncomfortable there.</p>

<p>In this scenario and with this very player, the reports ended up being right and the player wanting to stay was wrong, but people don&rsquo;t bring this up when they want to use the narrative of big market reporters lying about players wanting to leave.</p>

<p>Donovan Mitchell seemed to be following the same playbook as his extension talks neared in Cleveland. Same reports of an open secret that he wanted to leave. Mitchell had a lot of evident tension with his coach. But then the situation changed, he got a lot of money, and the coach got canned. It&rsquo;s probable that he just changed his mind, the situation changed.</p>

<p>It seems that sports fandom here is clouding people&rsquo;s judgement. They viewed reports of their player wanting to leave as an indictment of their city, and not what it probably was, a person who&rsquo;s basically a corporation exerting power to shape a situation they didn&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>100% wrong when a bunch were citing sources who work for NBA teams?</p>

<p>Will he include himself in an article like this if Mitchell demands a trade in the next year?</p>

<p>This ignores Mitchell&rsquo;s history. It also ignores the fact that the new way to switch teams is to sign an extension, then demand a trade.</p>

<p>Tons of talking heads/media guys make up fake narratives to get small market stars to big market teams. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that there aren&rsquo;t players in small markets who want to push to big cities.</p>
