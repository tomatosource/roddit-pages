<p>And yet it still needs to be said IMO. On any given day on this or other subreddits where an AI-related thread is posted, the comments are full of people claiming &ldquo;AI can never take MY job&rdquo; as they way overestimate their own abilities and underestimate the earthquake that AI will cause. Graphic design, script writing, illustration, film making, web development etc. &hellip; AI in its current state is already poised to shake up these industries in a big way. </p>

      <label for="l5pmxho" class="commentText"><p>And digital jobs won&rsquo;t go, their output will just multiply. We might need a lot less but that new amount remains to be seen. And from what I know, the really high skilled jobs are bottle necked around a small group of individuals as well.</p>

<p>For my example, my work already didn&rsquo;t have any in-house graphic design, we just outsourced when needed. And AI isn&rsquo;t at at a point yet where we can take a human out the loop - if you need two different images to contain the same group of characters, the tools available with no learning curve are not there yet. This will obviously be fixed, and may already be possible in good tools where you can train your own model, but not to the lay person.</p>

<p>A company like mine is unlikely to invest time in learning current tools - it&rsquo;ll just keep outsourcing to an agency. That agency may start using AI behind the scenes but there&rsquo;ll still be a person being paid by us for a long time. </p>

      <label for="l5phjl4" class="commentText"><p>It is poised to take on those jobs too.</p>

<p>A few years ago people were writing articles about why the robot revolution was so delayed and the answer is, it&rsquo;s really really really hard to be cheaper than human labor in some situations. Capitalism isn&rsquo;t really looking at misery and drudgery; but it will certainly kick in if the robots get cheap enough or the humans get expensive enough.</p>

<p>edit: I personally think UBI would help quite a bit here, as humans would not be pressured to take the drudgery jobs so much, and would be more free to do the creative jobs.</p>

<p>A robot can&rsquo;t weld together a body-on-frame 1970s Cadillac. So car manufacturers came up with the subframe design which a robot can weld. Nowadays, there are virtually no welders left in the car industry. They either have ABB robotic arms welding the cars, or assemblers use automatic welding rigs which don&rsquo;t require welding profficiency to use.</p>

<p>A welder who knows tig, mig, and stick just doesn&rsquo;t have a place in car manufacturing, even though a robot can&rsquo;t replace a qualified welder.</p>

<p>TLDR, the bandwagon / hivemind on reddit is generally not that insightful or bright.</p>

<p>Arguably we have been seeing exponential gains in AI since the 70s, so we may very well already be at the peak of the curve, not the beginning. </p>

<p>But we don’t know that yet. Same as we don’t know if we’re just at the start of the timeline. </p>

<p>We <em>do</em> know that genAI in filmmaking (aka Sora) still relies <em>heavily</em> on human improvement to be actually useful - and fails to be receptive to granular revisions. </p>

<p>You can’t make minute tweaks, rather you get a whole new result…and this last bit doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. </p>

What we have today is just really good machine learning that, once it is trained on a dataset, can only improve with more training. So it isn&rsquo;t an AI in the sense that it lacks intelligence and the ability to learn from mistakes and correct itself.

<p>The main point is that everytime any topic over what AI is going to do to the workforce comes up there is always people that say &ldquo;never my job&rdquo; like you know where any ai research will be in the future.

For me, especially, it&rsquo;s so helpful with writing automated tests, which is the biggest pain, IMO. It&rsquo;s good with small chunks of code, but once you get to full applications, it&rsquo;s easy to see how bad it can be.</p>

These models are running into two major issues: 1- hallucinations aren’t going away and every solution these AI ventures propose boils down to “we’ll make another AI to monitor this AI!” &amp; 2- the processing power escalation to make improvements to models is now exponential aka it’s getting more expensive to make less progress and the progress that is made makes the model permanently more expensive to run, which is a problem for AI companies operating at a net loss for each piece of content generated because they’re still in their “burn capitol/VC funding to demonstrate growth” phase.</p>

<p>I hate even calling it AI. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s very advanced machine learning, but that&rsquo;s not a sexy marketing term. I do think people&rsquo;s expectations would be more in line with what they can produce though if that was what we called this crap.</p>

<p>From everything I’ve read about the synthetic data sets, using them to train AI has only led to degeneration of the models (seeing them called “Habsburg AI” is genuinely made me giggle). Don’t get me wrong: synthetic data has its uses, but this ain’t it, Jack.</p>

<p>My brother fuckin hates Ace Ventura. Like really fuckin hates it. He also hates streaming and loves DVDs.</p>

<p>So I am going to create AI generated scenes of Ace Ventura absolutely raw dogging the shit out of his favorite characters in each movie, edit the scenes back into the movies, then burn off the movies and sneak them back into his collection.</p>

<p>That mean John McClane gets raw dogged. The entire cast of Predator is going to catch that Ace Ventura D. Captain Winters in Band of Brothers gets turned into a power bottom. Jim Carrey&rsquo;s character in Dumb and Dumber is getting pounded by Ace Ventura too. Both Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christiansen version) and Obi Wan Kenobi are getting pounced on by Ace Ventura, but I&rsquo;m going to split it up into different prequels. Sam is going to help Frodo carry an Ace Ventura load to Mount Doom.</p>

<p>As for sentience, idk really what people mean by that. I don’t think ai will ever ‘think’ like a human, or even remotely like a human. If AI is conscious, it’s probably further removed from human consciousness than most animals, since at least animals have brains. So I don’t think it’ll ever be sentient.

<p>But with the way AI fundamentally works, it will never be creative, be able to think critically. This is because deep learning models (the technology most modern AI uses to learn) is simply probability. It gives answers that will give it the highest reward.

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can define &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; to make your statement unfalsifiable, but in practice we&rsquo;re getting better and better at understanding how to manipulate AI models into giving us what we want. If you spend any time on /r/stablediffusion you&rsquo;ll see continuous advancement in the workflows and tools people use to make their artistic visions into AI-generated reality.</p>

<p>My prediction is, all the technology necessary to make largely AI-generated movies will exist within two years. Which isn&rsquo;t to say that most movies will be using AI in any real sense. But I think the main bottleneck will be the familiarity of creatives with the tooling used for AI, not the AI itself.</p>

<p>I think there are levels. Such as something like spellcheck, that&rsquo;s a very basic algorithm but one could argue it&rsquo;s a form of AI because we&rsquo;ve had such a moving goalpost over the decades as to what AI even means. But going beyond something like spellcheck to something more complicated like predictive text or even a program like Grammarly that gives suggestion for tone, conciseness or word choice. None of that replaces an real editor, but a lot of people would see them as tools that help you as you write, yet they&rsquo;re easily argued as being AI companions.</p>

<p>Trying to find a definite line between what&rsquo;s a helpful tool and what&rsquo;s damaging can be pretty hard. It&rsquo;s easy to say that spellcheck is fine but writing an essay with an LLM is bad, but where in the in-between does that change? If you have writer&rsquo;s block and you ask for an AI to analyze what you&rsquo;ve written so far and write, say, the next page or a summary of how the story would progress, is that using a tool or is that problematic? (Right now that&rsquo;s problematic because of copyright issues, but let us assume that they&rsquo;re using a model that was only trained on public domain and legally licensed data sets.)</p>

<p>Do you really think that Hollywood execs will use AI to make better movies and not just crappy movies but a bit faster and a bit cheaper? And really, it&rsquo;s only a bit cheaper. You still need the marketing budget. Good luck not paying several million to top-level stars. And we all know the people at the top want maximum return on investment (read: biggest paycheck possible for a guy who didn&rsquo;t help make the movie). So you&rsquo;re only saving on the cheaper bits anyway.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re already at the point where a skilled artist with a decent PC and an iPhone can make a solid short film. Most of the people who are going to get laid off by the major studios will lack the business sense to make a good indie studio. But a fair number will succeed. And a few of them will consolidate into new major studios to replace the old, until they too start making dumb decisions out of greed.</p>

      <label for="l5pshar" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. So many people miss the problem of curation in these discussions - if we want meaningful, high-quality and culturally relevant results when it comes to producing creative media of any kind, human curation will be an indispensable part of the process. I also don’t believe there will be sustainable interest in services that generate unique movies or music from end-user prompts. Everyone seems to think they have the imagination, it’s just the skill, time and resources that they lack. But they’re very, very wrong. Most people lack both the imagination and the taste required to be a culturally impactful creative. They would also start to feel weird about the fact that everything they’d experience from such a service would be unique to them. A major aspect of any media experience is the discussions we have about it afterwards - watching some bespoke movie generated from a prompt you’ve farted onto the keyboard when you flop back onto the sofa after you’ve had a skinful down the pub is not going to cut it.</p>

<p>Most AI tools used to create visual and animated content nowadays are entirely predictable and deterministic. A human has to sit down and learn how to use them, and he has to plan the steps required to go from his or his client&rsquo;s intention to an actual piece of animated content.</p>

<p>Unpredictability and randomness are also entirely valid avenues for anyone making art, with or without computers and AI technology.</p>

      <label for="l5p0cz8" class="commentText"><p>but there can be a balance e.g. I&rsquo;m a screenwriter and if I&rsquo;m able to get the rights to this fantasy book series I want to adapt for TV then e.g. the monsters/other sorts of nonhuman intelligent creatures would be done with puppets or prosthetics depending on their size and level-of-human-shaped-ness but things that couldn&rsquo;t be replicable with practical effects easily (at least without looking dated imho though I think part of why some people don&rsquo;t like practical effects is a self-defeating loop of only old shows/movies use them so people think they look old and cheap or w/e) like whenever someone&rsquo;s magic manifests as magical energy instead of, like, manipulating something would be CGI</p>

<p>More generally, I expect we will be able to ask LLMs to infer original content in the genre or series of our choosing, eventually.  Like, &ldquo;Computer! Generate an entire season of Star Trek: The Next Generation which takes place between the events of Season Two and Season Three!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re a long way from seeing it happen, though.  There are open source scriptwriter models which aren&rsquo;t bad, but there is a huge difference between writing a script for a show and generating the complete multimedia experience.</p>

There will be little content silos, there will be a LOT of generic or boring/unoriginal stuff, fluff etc&hellip; But there will also be a whole bunch more quite good content mostly produced independently on a small scale (a popular channel on YouTube just needing 1-5 people or something, vs getting a network to like your script and so on).</p>

      <label for="l5owumu" class="commentText"><p>Like I said above it is the holodeck. A shared platform with all the content personalised to the individual. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with Star Trek but they had &ldquo;holo novels&rdquo; that would use shared times, places, and characters to tell an individual story. Like video games do now, but only in an extremely basic and preprogrammed way. Imagine GTA 7 where you can have an 8-hour deep conversation with every NPC who all work on their own internal logic, like a simulation of the real world. If I had to bet that is exactly what GTA 7 will be, if someone doesn&rsquo;t beat Rockstar to it.</p>

<p>It may sound amazing but, speaking as a huge Trekkie, TNG was only as lovable as it was because it was very very human. Nothing, AI or otherwise, can replicate the magic that came from those creators being there and doing what they did at that exact moment in time (see Star Trek Picard for evidence of that). Having access to &ldquo;new&rdquo; episodes at any moment will do nothing but cheapen what the series means to the world.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that movies will be made for those AI agents, but that there will be so much content available that it will be impossible for each creation to be seen (and even less reviewed) even by one person. We only have so much time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lucas gave a wide-ranging interview to French outlet <a href="https://x.com/brutofficiel/status/1794018944602259706" target="_blank">Brut FR</a> at the Cannes Film Festival recently, which you can watch in full below, in which he talks about his history in film, his thoughts on the future of cinema, and more. At one point during the 10-minute chat (around the 5:30 mark), the interviewer asks Lucas about how he feels about the use of AI in filmmaking, and Lucas starts by touching on the visual effects company he founded, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), and the ways in which it&rsquo;s changed cinematic technology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been using it for 25 years, and it&rsquo;s not AI, but we use all the digital technology because we pioneered a lot of that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Because especially at ILM, we were the only place that was doing digital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the thing of it is,&rdquo; Lucas goes on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s inevitable. I mean, it&rsquo;s like saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe these cars are gunna work. Let&rsquo;s just stick with the horses. Let&rsquo;s stick with the horses.&rsquo; And yeah, you can say that, but that isn&rsquo;t the way the world works.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l5p1g46" class="commentText"><p>When it comes to AI and entertainment (as far as the endgame people often imagine where it can generate a whole show/game/movie of whatever you wan, not just using AI to help with film making) I always think about how even with fiction there seems to be an overwhelming desire for the &ldquo;official&rdquo; or &ldquo;canon&rdquo; story. Sure, fan fics can be fun and very popular, but there&rsquo;s a reason people get so invested and emotional about the latest Star Wars or Star Trek content. Even though it&rsquo;s all fictional and you could just believe what you want to believe, it seems people care a lot about what is the &ldquo;true&rdquo; story whether they like it or not.</p>

<p>Is this just because the production quality of the official media? Or is there a deeper desire to know the &ldquo;real&rdquo; version that, for better or worse, we all share as an experience. If it&rsquo;s the former, then maybe the lines will be blurred by AI and interest in official stories will dwindle in favour of your own curated stories. But if it&rsquo;s the latter, I see scenario where human driven art is still in popular demand. The artist, author, etc may use AI to create the visuals/images but they are still the source and soul of the art.</p>

<p>I often think of One Punch Man and its creator, Yusuke Murata. I&rsquo;m sure there are other artists who could make pretty convincing fanfics about the series. Perhaps soon even AI could do it. People might think the ideas or art are neat, but in the end won&rsquo;t they really just be waiting for Yusuke Murata to release his next chapter?</p>

<p>I admit, I may be a bit biased to the latter perspective, which is why I pose it as a question for discussion. I think AI can and will do a lot of great stuff. If they ever reach sentience/consciousness (whatever that really means) and can create of their own volition I think it would.be really cool to seem what a mind so different than ours would come up with.</p>

Sure, it’ll definitely make things easier. But the entire point of film making, or any art form, is that its beautiful because PEOPLE made it. It’s something that a group of people used their minds and their talents to make. I have absolutely zero interest in seeing something that AI made, even if human prompts helped it. I wanna see what people make, for better or worse.</p>

<p>The guy who complain in the same interview about lack of originality certainly isn’t advocating for replacing artists.</p>

<p>There are a lot of time consuming and monotonous tasks that AI would be great at expediting so that the human artists can focus more on the actual creative process rather than the raw production.</p>

<p>The problem though is the people who make the choices of what to spend money on often aren’t interested in the actual creative process. What’s most efficient? What’s most economical?</p>

<p>If we fire all of these artsy creatives and farm out the creation process to Artificial Intelligence’s then just think of the cost savings. And then since all of the creatives will be out of work we can offer them a pittance to do a once over on the AI’s work so it’ll have that “human touch.”</p>

Could a person explain the artistic genius of someone like Spielberg or Scorsese to a layman 125 years ago?</p>

<p>Turns out we all think we know what makes a good movie, to us anyways, but it&rsquo;s not like all of us can be good directors, given the chance. Pretty sure the majority of the output would be sub-par.</p>

<p>The cast and crew may have been reduced to one, but it still takes someone with talent to make it look good, and that talent will eventually emerge.  Not the art created by a machine, but the right person telling the machine what art to produce.</p>

      <label for="l5p8o7c" class="commentText"><p>Not for nothin&hellip; but I kind of want AI in filmmaking.</p>

<p>Example - My wife gets dizzy when the camera shakes even a little. And when you notice it, it happens extremely frequently. It&rsquo;s a style of filmmaking.</p>

<p>But AI was doing the editing, for example, it could edit the show so the camera didn&rsquo;t shake.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s certain tropes we don&rsquo;t like - I don&rsquo;t know why but I always get weirded out by ultrasounds. AI editing could remove those tropes without losing any story.</p>

<hr>

<p>Further&hellip; With AI audio, video, and actors, there&rsquo;d be no such thing as the end of the story. You could have more episodes of a show like Firefly. You could have infinite other stories in the same universe. You could review fresh stories and review them.</p>

<p>The problem, and I agree, is it puts a LOT of people out of work. I think you&rsquo;d still have &lsquo;real&rsquo; movies and shows. But absolutely far far fewer.</p>

      <label for="l5pa0hv" class="commentText"><p>Dude I run events in a game, basically DM shit. I have started using AI while developing and running my events and it has brought them to another level.</p>

<p>What I do is I write the script and how I want characters to interact with each other and I ask the AI to write branching dialogue options that could be used if things go wrong. Then I take those branching dialogue options, I rewrite them as I wish and redo it. Plug the edited version in, rinse and repeat. More branches over time.</p>

<p>So over the course of a few hours I go from a simple script to something more reminiscent of an early 2000s &ldquo;Choose your own Adventure&rdquo; novel. One of those ones where it is like &ldquo;You enter a room and see a door, a refrigerator and a sofa. If you go to the door flip to page 27. If you check the refrigerator flip to page 79. If you take a nap on the sofa flip to page 42.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I study that script, I memorize as much as possible, I imput the entire thing <em>back into AI</em> and as I go and as people make decisions I tell the AI to go to the part that corresponds with the current situation and it goes immediately to that spot so I can go specific parts of the script that fit that exact situation within seconds.</p>

<p>No more spending days writing everything I think of down only for it to go out the window immediately. No more hoping I remember specific things when they are needed and no more hoping I can <em>find</em> those things when needed and don&rsquo;t just spend five minutes flipping through a playbook while stalling for time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty great.</p>

<p>So yeah, moral of the story is that I can 100% see this being used in TV and movies and then the director just <em>picks</em> the path they like best rather than adapting to a bunch of trigger happy murder hobos.</p>

<p>A.I is rapidly progressing right now but in the next year or 2 we will see the improvements start to plateau for a while. Sora(which recently turned out to need alterations done in post by humans) has many issues that I don&rsquo;t think are gonna be so easy to solve as quickly. Things like Sora don&rsquo;t comprehend the physical world it&rsquo;s creating in those images, scale and depth are a mess.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also crazy to think so many people believe a paragraph in a prompt is enough to produce a perfect shot. I can&rsquo;t imagine we&rsquo;re anywhere close from having the necessary control in producing a shot where the director can just prompt it to move the camera 5 cm up etc. without it producing unintended results.</p>

<p>AI is even less &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; than cars were because AI, like NFTs, is a solution looking for a problem. AI is incredibly unprofitable, unreliable, looks to cut cost by firing people, and primarily produces shit. The gambit that AI proponents are relying on is convincing enough stupid people that AI is inevitable so that everyone surrenders to it and embeds it so deeply into our culture that we have to continue using it. This does have a decent chance of working, but it is far from &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;.</p>
