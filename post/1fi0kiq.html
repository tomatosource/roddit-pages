      <label for="lndwi54" class="commentText"><p>It what started with a tweet. It has since pushed others to speak up and changed the NBA. No one should fear the stigma in asking for help when it comes to their mental health. Good on DeMar for being at the forefront of this important issue in the sport and in society in general.</p>

      <label for="lne2kw4" class="commentText"><p>We were 41-16 when he first tweeted. We were balling, top of the EC.</p>

<p>It just goes to show how you can have everything going right for you and still struggle mentally.</p>

<p>DeMar’s biggest flaw is that he lets his emotions take him out of games. Back in 2018 when he was 29, he was super sensitive on the court and nba vets would just bait him. Completely shat the bed against the Cavs, 13 points in game one and 8 points in game 2. Just unacceptable for a franchise player.</p>

<p>LeBron averaged 34 for the series and DeMar averaged 16… The same as Valanciunas! After the season we had it was an incredibly lacklustre performance which pretty much green lit the move for Kawhi.</p>

<p>I hope he comes back to TO for his last season because he’s dearly loved over here.</p>

      <label for="lnetiw0" class="commentText"><p>Ngl (probably over sharing) but my gf is going through a DeMar situation atm. On paper we have a decent life and have things that’s most would kill for. However, she suffers really badly with depression and it comes out at times when both of us are ‘doing well’. It can be infuriating and can be completely illogical/irrational because it usually doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p>It sometimes makes me question me as a person/bf. Like why is she so sad? Am I the issues?! Sometimes I guess but she grew up without a family and experienced trauma at a young age. I grew up with a loving family who I speak with almost every day. This alone can be enough to upset her if she’s having a bad day. She’ll reject love because it’s what she’s used to.</p>

<p>Basically, living with someone with quite severe mental health issues is really fucking tough. It must be 100 times tougher for the person with the issues though.</p>

<p>At least DeMar has the money and resources to get back on track. For most it seems like a never ending uphill battle. I’m so glad he’s talking about it as a public figure. Most preach about mental health but not many allow strangers to peep through the curtains and see what they’re suffering with.</p>

      <label for="lnelzku" class="commentText"><p>I am so glad Demar opened up about this. This is what people who are blessed with good genetics seem to not understand in general. Demar seemingly has &lsquo;everything&rsquo;. But when you are depressed, you don&rsquo;t care about what you have. You could have millions in the bank. You could have all the girls wanting to be around you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. All you want to do is to be alone and be lethargic.</p>

<p>Despite how much people destigmatize male mental health. I will still hear guys rebuttal to mental health be &lsquo;why are you depressed? You have X, Y, Z&rsquo;. X, Y, Z usually being a combination of money and/or attention or some derivative of those things.</p>

He had decided not to go to a concert with his friends nor to an All-Star Game party where he was expected to make an appearance. He was overwhelmed by people hitting him up, asking him for tickets to the game or to drop in on the party. And he just needed rest.</p>

<p>“It just kind of made me hit a wall. You know, it led me to, in the middle of the night, to tweet out a tweet,” said DeMar</p>

      <label for="lneep6j" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s great that people are starting to embrace the mentality of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ok to not be ok&rdquo;, but the next hurdle is really normalising that <em>during difficult circumstances</em>. Right now a lot of people still have the mindset of it&rsquo;s ok to struggle, just do it on your own time and don&rsquo;t let it impact your performance, which is really still a very harmful mentality.</p>

      <label for="lneeic1" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s why this discussion about mental health is so important - events don&rsquo;t &ldquo;make you depressed&rdquo; by themselves.</p>

<p>Rather, depression is caused by a complex combination of factors including chemical imbalances (which lead to faulty mood regulation in the brain), genetics and stressful life events.</p>

<p>When we talk about the beginnings of depression we are really referring to it being triggered by stress most of the time, but those events alone aren&rsquo;t <em>making you depressed</em>, they&rsquo;re triggering symptoms based on what is already going on in your brain.</p>
