      <label for="lf7bjou" class="commentText"><p>Lmao.  The Joe Smith co-sign was hilarious</p>

<p>This goes to show just how common these testy locker rooms actually are in the NBA</p>

<p>I’ve been doing watching a bunch of these videos recently with former players and stories. Some amazing stories out there. My favorite player storyteller recently has been Vernon Maxwell. His interview on Gil Arenas show was absolutely hilarious, especially about how Hakeem would slap his teammates all the time</p>

      <label for="lf7kudm" class="commentText"><p>Interesting story in a number of regards.</p>

<p>For one, it&rsquo;s kind of a peek inside at veteran influence. I remember Joe Smith being wayyyy past his prime at the time, to the point you kind of just assume he&rsquo;s an add-on to any roster that picks him up. But there&rsquo;s clearly weight to him stepping up and being like, &ldquo;Did he stutter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Second, as a Pistons fan it&rsquo;s fun to hear Joakim refer to Ben as Body so casually, just because that&rsquo;s a nickname that really just felt like a random inclusion on his Basketball Reference page. Media and fans just stuck with Big Ben. Reminds me of Wilt Chamberlain preferring &ldquo;Dipper&rdquo; while the public insisted upon Wilt the Stilt.</p>

<p>Third, I&rsquo;m guilty of this myself but it&rsquo;s interesting how our memories can so casually exaggerate certain details of stories. The Bulls lost to the Hawks by 21 in the second game of his suspension, and the lead never really stretched too far beyond that (a far cry from 50). But a 21-point loss can feel like losing by 50 sometimes, so I get it.</p>

<p>Lastly, interesting to hear how intimidating Ben legitimately was to fellow players. Sometimes you wonder how much of that is built up by us, but for Joakim to be like, &ldquo;this is a dude who wears two headbands on his arms&rdquo;&hellip; that&rsquo;s real.</p>

      <label for="lf7nmwz" class="commentText"><p>Sheed, Rip and Chauncey called Ben &ldquo;Body&rdquo; on occasion. More in interviews away from the court. I think Rip might even say it in the Face Time he has with Ben just after the draft lottery where Ben represented the Pistons and we got the Cade pick.</p>

<p>As for intimidation. When even Artest (who was crazy strong and somewhat just crazy crazy) was intimidated by Ben, that&rsquo;s when I knew it was real.</p>

<p>He might have been on an ESPN segment a few times to talk UFC, but I guarantee Rogan was never talking NBA in any facet.</p>

      <label for="lf82euj" class="commentText"><p>You’re wrong. That interview from 2019. In the story Joakim is telling it would have been 2007, 2 years before Rogan even started his podcast.</p>

<p>Also did you even watch the clip? Laird the surfer guy is the one who brings up Joakim Noah and how he is helping him rehab in a pool. Rogan shows no recognition of knowing who Joakim Noah is and doesn’t mention him at all, only Laird says his name twice.</p>

<p>Just because you a found transcript of another guy mentioning Joakim Noah to Joe Rogan a full 12 years after this story happened doesn’t mean Joe Rogan knows who he was in 2007 or was on ESPN you dolt.</p>

      <label for="lf86tps" class="commentText"><p>Lol okay then find me a clip of Rogan being on ESPN and talking NBA. The NBA has come up like twice on his podcast in 2000+ episodes, one is if Lebron did MMA, the other is Jordan’s rivalries/ competitive spirit.</p>

<p>Rogan has come out and said he knows nothing about professional sports outside of MMA and he doesn’t really care, I think he’s even specifically mentioned not knowing anything about the NBA to Sam Morrill when he talks Knicks. Which is my larger point, Rogan self admittedly knows nothing about the NBA. But if you wanna get nitpicky and think Joe Rogan was on ESPN in 2007 talking NBA I would love any evidence of that. Hell I’ll take him on ESPN talking about any sport except MMA or boxing.</p>
