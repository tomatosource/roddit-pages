<p>Bogdan Bogdanovic: “We tried to talk to referees; they didn&rsquo;t try to talk to us, but it&rsquo;s ok. The USA doesn&rsquo;t need that type of help against us. We didn&rsquo;t have that type of help when they were grabbing us with two hands and all that. We played the best we could.”</p>

<p>For my two cents, I thought the physicality the refs allowed the Serbians to play with was disparate to what the US was allowed throughout the game and the Embiid play is not a travel at any level of ball, imo. I thought the six point play was a blatant foul by Jokic, but the rule is odd. However the LeBron play has to be a defensive foul or carry and it&rsquo;s crazy they didn&rsquo;t call either and Durant very possibly was out of bounds.</p>

<p>Do you think their complaints are legitimate?</p>

<p>US did get some borderline calls down the stretch but if everyone didn’t see this outcome coming from the moment Bogdanovic started chirping too much then I don’t know what to tell you. Poke the bear and suffer the consequences.</p>

Jokic got some really sus calls against AD, but overall that didn’t impact the out. Bron and Steph are two of the very last “bears” I’d want to poke in an elimination game. Like dude are you not familiar with their work??</p>

      <label for="lhbnl69" class="commentText"><p>Yes by a wide margin too. Jokic got an And-1 after elbowing Bam on a layup. Jokic also threw Booker to get open which resulted in Booker being out of position and then booker gets called for the foul which resulted into an And-1</p>

<p>most of the time Jokic does his turnaround spin he elbows the defender either at the back of their shoulders or at the back of their kidney.</p>

Embiid big and fast and also spams rip through and pump fakes which is annoying but is part of the game. Giannis just has guys tackle him the moment he gets 5 feet from the basket to prevent him from getting 2 points easy</p>

<p>You can argue all day that he doesn’t get called as much as he should but he was 4th in the league last year with 45 (behind KAT, Sabonis and JJJ) while Jokic was 43rd with 21. Clearly he’s getting called a hell of a lot more than Jokic.</p>

<p>First quarter: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub></p>

<p>Second: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub></p>

<p>Third quarter: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub></p>

<p>Fourth quarter: 0/8</p>

<p>If anything, this game (and vs Nigeria) shows how todays game that anyone (incl USA) is beatable  if they can shoot at a high rate from beyond the arc and can sustain it for four quarters.</p>

      <label for="lhcc8gp" class="commentText"><p>Morris made a crazy dirty play on Jokic and then turned his back to him. The only NBA players I’ve ever seen blame Jokic for that one are the Morris brothers—everyone else understands that if you’re going to make those hockey enforcer type plays and hit people you have to protect yourself afterwards. Can’t turn your back on the guy you just cheap shot half a second ago.</p>

<p>Morris took the first shot, Jokic retaliated proportionately and in kind, and Morris got hurt. It was obviously an intentional shove but Jokic didn’t mean to injure him and wouldn’t have if Morris had protected himself like anyone with an ounce of common sense would have after starting a fight. People who play stupid violent games tend to win stupid violent prizes.</p>

<p>Bog leading the charge as a player is wild. Especially with his ass dialed-in, looking eazy-breezy and still deciding to jaw and mock an Olympic legend like Melo. Who wasn’t even involved beyond being there for his guys in a tough game from the floor seats. <a href="https://x.com/nalsizm/status/1821944661293883694" target="_blank">Mf was expeditiously counting every last chicken before they hatched before the first half was over and shrinking well after a 2-point play that doesn’t even account for the 6 point play to force a timeout when Jokic got his fourth foul 🤷🏾‍♂️</a></p>

      <label for="lhbk2wp" class="commentText"><p>As a Serb I thought the game was physical and I liked the lack of fouls, and thought the game was mostly fair. There was a couple of weird things like a 1 LeBron carry, the Embiid travel when Pesic got a technical and maybe one Embiid flop towards the end of the game that got an and 1, but nothing too egregious. I thought the 6 point play for the US on the Jokic foul was super weird but apparently its in the FIBA rulebook so it is what it is.</p>

<p>Overall still an amazing game for us, almost beat one of the best teams of all time and we get to fight for the bronze.
The guys gave it their all, but ran out of gas at the end, nothing to feel ashamed about.</p>

      <label for="lhbl3i5" class="commentText"><p>The game was physical both ways. You can easily compile a ton of uncalled fouls by the Serbian team which included a ton of those Jokic illegal picks disguised as a roll where he pushes the defender towards the basket to leave the shooter alone on the perimeter which made for a ton of Serbia&rsquo;s open 3s. AD got into foul trouble because Jokic kept hooking him. The refs even gave Serbia an obvious make up travel call after they complained about Embiid.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, the saying always goes that the basketball gods will always give you a chance to win the game if you play it. They had multiple missed wide open 3s that otherwise would have put away the game. The Americans made their shots.</p>

      <label for="lhcdd9l" class="commentText"><p>What about LeBron getting hacked only 4 layup and not getting called for and 1s. The flops, the Serbian coach on the court, Serbia taking too much time inbounding (unsportsmanlike), Jokic blatant offensive fouls (elbowing and hooking arms), Bogdanovic elbow on Embiid for the and 1 (should’ve been an offensive foul).</p>

<p>Additionally, 0/10 from 3 in the 4th (3 wide open), ball slipping out of hand, missing easy layups, bad turnovers WILL make you lose the game.</p>

<p>This was not a ref mistake, this was a CHOKE JOB.
They need to reflect on their own performance rather than blaming refs.</p>

      <label for="lhc5aoj" class="commentText"><p>The only calls that I feel iffy about were the technical and the 6 point play.</p>

<p>The T cause I can&rsquo;t know what was said, and there have been very few times in my life I&rsquo;ve seen a T called and been happy about it.</p>

<p>The 6-point play was definitely a foul, I just don&rsquo;t know that the timing was right for it to be handled like it was. Nobody on the mics seemed sure either.</p>

<p>Other than that, there were definitely calls that could have gone the other way, but I think that applied to both teams. The calls did help swing the momentum, though, so I can understand being upset even if I don&rsquo;t agree it was rigged.</p>

      <label for="lhc8o6d" class="commentText"><p>Serbia bricked those 3s in the 4th quarter.</p>

<p>To beat USA they had to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Increase the lead with Jokic on the bench</li>
<li>Shoot 3s at a very high level</li>
<li>Punish USA for all the turnovers and convert</li>
<li>Be physical</li>
<li>Second chance points</li>
</ol>

<p>They did all that but ran out of 3 magic in the 4th when USA finally played D and bron switched onto Joker.</p>

<p>Bogie played a helluva game. But don’t pout about this shit. Makes you looks stupid man. Your squad showed up and played 150% over their capabilities, but let’s be real, not beating KD, Steph, and Bron on the same court at the same time. Just not gonna happen.</p>
