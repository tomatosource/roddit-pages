<p>“Where I do give Mark (Jackson) credit, is the confidence he instilled in us to be okay with us being us… I can remember vividly conversations with him like, ‘[Steph], you’re the baddest dude on the planet!’ This was before Steph was an All-Star&hellip; We&rsquo;re in meetings, we&rsquo;re in practice, we&rsquo;re in the locker room, and he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Dude, you&rsquo;re the baddest dude on the planet.&rsquo; Klay has no conscience and most coaches would force him to have a conscience. Mark Jackson was like, &lsquo;Dude, you don&rsquo;t think, shoot.&rsquo; What Mark instilled in us allowed us to become that.”</p>

<p>Iguodala:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lacob isn&rsquo;t the only one who has consistently praised the work Jackson did on the court. Curry publicly lobbied for Jackson to keep his job before Golden State ultimately opted to fire him. Andre Iguodala went on &ldquo;The Breakfast Club&rdquo; podcast in 2019 and called Jackson one of his &ldquo;favorite coaches of all time&rdquo; while asserting that Jackson has, in his opinion, been blackballed from the NBA.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody who doesn&rsquo;t give that man a whole bunch of credit for what he was able to spearhead and get started out there, I think they&rsquo;re just not in reality. They just don&rsquo;t know the situation,&rdquo; Jarrett Jack, who played, and thrived, for the 2012-13 Warriors under Jackson, once told CBS Sports. &ldquo;I was in those huddles. I was in those locker room sessions. The way he talked to us, the amount of confidence he gave us. Go look at the kind of defense the Warriors were playing before Coach Jackson showed up, and look at them now. &hellip; Anybody that tries to downplay his role in [what the Warriors became], that&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Klay:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Give Coach Jackson credit,” said Thompson. “Before anybody else, [before] anybody believed in us, Coach Jackson did. He called me and Steph [Curry] the greatest shooting duo of all-time. I mean, that couldn’t have come more true. Just kind of a testament to your ability to read the game. They called you crazy, but at the time …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Curry</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coach Jackson pulled me out of the locker room. He’s like, ‘Hey, yo. I just have to let you know, they wanted you in the trade. But for whatever reason like that’s part of the doctor, it didn’t go down like that cause I kind of stepped in too and said I’m gonna give you the keys that’s why I really believed in you. We just gonna get you healthy and that’s what the rest of the season is gonna be all about.’ His line was “don’t make me a liar.”</p>

      <label for="ljb9m8e" class="commentText"><p>The only damn thing to credit Jackson for is him improving the defense, meanwhile the offense was static despite Curry&rsquo;s improvements.</p>

<p>Jackson&rsquo;s system involved post ups and isos that didn&rsquo;t involve Curry at all and having Curry play a traditional point guard that doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of Curry&rsquo;s shooting.</p>

<p>Kerr&rsquo;s system switched to running post splits intended to get Curry or another teammate open, depending on which one the defense messes up on. It allowed Curry to shoot more since Bogut or Draymond was the one passing and allowed others to use Curry and Klay&rsquo;s gravity to cut to the basket.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a video from BBallBreakdown years ago that analyzed the difference between the two coaches and he made that video just off Kerr&rsquo;s preseason games in his first year.</p>

<p>you talking about postups cause Warriors literally had an All-Star big man averaging <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> doing that. why would he not embrace it? Draymond literally got his break out opportunity under Mark and Kerr used his template next season</p>

<p>we&rsquo;ve seen how many issues Kerr is having with the transition from the vets to young players now. imagine if he had to develop Steph/Dray/Klay when they were young. he&rsquo;d still be starting Lee over Draymond</p>
