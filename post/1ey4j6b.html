<blockquote>
<p>“Where I do give Mark (Jackson) credit, is the confidence he instilled in us to be okay with us being us… I can remember vividly conversations with him like, ‘[Steph], you’re the baddest dude on the planet!’ This was before Steph was an All-Star&hellip; We&rsquo;re in meetings, we&rsquo;re in practice, we&rsquo;re in the locker room, and he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Dude, you&rsquo;re the baddest dude on the planet.&rsquo; Klay has no conscience and most coaches would force him to have a conscience.

      <label for="ljb9m8e" class="commentText"><p>The only damn thing to credit Jackson for is him improving the defense, meanwhile the offense was static despite Curry&rsquo;s improvements.</p>

<p>Jackson&rsquo;s system involved post ups and isos that didn&rsquo;t involve Curry at all and having Curry play a traditional point guard that doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of Curry&rsquo;s shooting.</p>

<p>Kerr&rsquo;s system switched to running post splits intended to get Curry or another teammate open, depending on which one the defense messes up on. It allowed Curry to shoot more since Bogut or Draymond was the one passing and allowed others to use Curry and Klay&rsquo;s gravity to cut to the basket.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a video from BBallBreakdown years ago that analyzed the difference between the two coaches and he made that video just off Kerr&rsquo;s preseason games in his first year.</p>

<p>you talking about postups cause Warriors literally had an All-Star big man averaging <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> doing that. why would he not embrace it? Draymond literally got his break out opportunity under Mark and Kerr used his template next season</p>

<p>we&rsquo;ve seen how many issues Kerr is having with the transition from the vets to young players now. imagine if he had to develop Steph/Dray/Klay when they were young. he&rsquo;d still be starting Lee over Draymond</p>

<p>Draymond:</p>

      <label for="ljeqqzw" class="commentText"><p>The reason why he got the only unanimous MVP is because he had <em>one of</em> the best seasons in NBA history, which I said.</p>

<p>Saying <em>one of</em> the best implies that others have had just as good if not better seasons, which means some of them also deserved to be the unanimous MVP.</p>

<p>I never stated that nobody else deserved to be a unanimous MVP and my comment didn’t imply that. All I said was Curry winning the only one shows that he had one of the greatest individual seasons in NBA history, which is true.</p>

I&rsquo;m saying that I actually do think your comment t could reasonably be interpreted to say that there is a reason he is the <em>only</em> player to get a unanimous MVP.</p>

<p>Because he had one of the best but not the best season then what would be the reason he is the only one? See how it could be ambiguous? This is all semantics but it still shows how both of yall could be correct here.</p>

      <label for="ljeb66e" class="commentText"><p>Tbh if the 15-16 Warriors win, I think they get one of the next two as well. Probably 16-17, then lose to Rockets in 17-8. So that would still put Steph at 4 rings, greatest record, potentially 3 MVPs, as well as 2-3 Finals MVPs. Plus his counting stats would be higher without having to share the rock with KD - playing with KD took away 3 prime Curry years where he would have just been doing stupid Curry shit <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> as the main guy.</p>

<p>TLDR: If Warriors win in 15-16, KD probably doesn&rsquo;t join the Warriors and Curry likely has 4 rings, 3 MVPs, 3 Finals MVPs, and counting stats of 25K/6.5K/4.5K as of current. Easily top 10 oat.</p>

      <label for="ljeyf3o" class="commentText"><p>Something in me just tells me the Warriors wouldn&rsquo;t have lost to the Rockets even without KD. Maybe it&rsquo;s what happened in 2019. I just felt like against the Rockets specifically, the Warriors did great without KD.</p>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say I think they would have won two championships without KD. I just think the warriors hated the rockets so much that they would have somehow found a way to win. </p>

<p>When KD joined it made it easier to like Steph. Because it felt like LeBron and Steph was the new Magic-Bird and KD ruined that. So KD took the heat.</p>

<p>Its been nice rooting for Steph the last few years. Because when its not your lifelong dreams being crushed, its much easier to appreciate undeniable greatness.</p>

      <label for="ljcy9xr" class="commentText"><p>I think 16 curry had the better season, leading the league in scoring and efficiency is insane.</p>

<p>But I think 21 and 22 curry is a better player. While in the regular season he wasn&rsquo;t as good (especially 22), his increased strength and improved defense made him much better in the playoffs. His strength in particular made double teaming him so much more difficult - I remember in 2016 lanky double teams turned him into a turnover machine. That was not the case in 21-22, he was always under control.</p>

<p>Jordan and LeBron were great and all, but those guys were athletic marvels. Sure, their skill level was also incredible, but it was the athleticism combined with the skill that made them unstoppable.</p>

<p>In 2016, Curry was destroying the league simply by being the most skilled basketball player I had ever seen. The shooting, the ball handling, his crazy touch around the basket. I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible to be that good at basketball.</p>

      <label for="ljfe4xi" class="commentText"><p>If anyone is actually old enough to experience 2016 curry, they will definitely agree it’s the best version of Curry. You have to take into context where before this season no one was consistently taking deep threes with the greenest green light. Not even 1-2 steps behind the arc. Curry made so many quick deep threes so easily, it looked like he was just chucking with no skills and the ball automatically went in.</p>

<p>I was watching that OKC game-winning bang three on livestream. As soon as Curry crossed the half court line I thought, “bruh they have to start defending him.” Two more steps later I still didn’t see any form of contest and I was like, “fuck is you doing OKC?” Then Curry just let it fly. That three was so deep it felt like it took 5 sec to reach the net, and not even in 1 of the 5 seconds did I though it would miss</p>

Every arena started having an army of Curry fans cheering against their home teams. People would show up (still do) at the arena more than an hour ahead of the game just to watch his warmups. NBA has seen lots of big stars, but never a show like Curry.</p>
