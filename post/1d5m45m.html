</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I understand that his shot is deadly and his strength is very underrated so you can’t get to close or he’ll step back  and counter from there if it’s not open (it’s almost always open) and put you on his back for the middy or floater . My question is how is he getting world class athletes like Ant to bite at his moves if they know in theory they should have the recovery speed to not have to commit to any one move and play straight up</p>

      <label for="l6mnxvx" class="commentText"><p>This is really what’s at the heart of it. If you’ve ever played basketball against someone that can really hit their step backs, it’s ALWAYS on your mind that they’re going into that move. There are guys that are really good at selling a move with their body and then changing course immediately. The combination of that (defenders preoccupation with him launching a shot + his ability to sell + his ability to change course) means that it just doesn’t matter how fast he is because the defender is off balance and out of position.</p>

<p>you can&rsquo;t guard a fadeaway unless you&rsquo;re about 3-4 inches taller than the guy.  If you&rsquo;re shorter, forget it.  The best you can do is make him uncomfortable and not let him get where he wants to get on the court. But once he&rsquo;s there and he&rsquo;s committed, then that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>The worst part about it is usually I feel like I&rsquo;ve played great defense.  I turn around, and swish, nothing I could have done better.  My teammates will look at me and shrug, say &ldquo;great defense&rdquo;.  yeah i know, but he still made it. fuck my life.</p>

<p>Grantland did a fantastic article on LeBron learning in Miami how to get to his ideal spots to shoot, drive or pass. </p>

<p>Luka has his spots but his offensive versatility means he&rsquo;s essentially dangerous with the ball anywhere on the court, including his range to send oops to teammates already near the basket. </p>

<p>Defending Luka means having to consider every option and with fantastic perimeter defence at best you might &lsquo;force&rsquo; him into stepbacks on a day when his three isn&rsquo;t falling. 
And now it seems even trying to go at him when he&rsquo;s defending and hoping to wear his legs out isn&rsquo;t as effective as it used to be. </p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>I think all of the first 4 are comparable in some way to each other and all MVP level performances. But 22-23 his defense was plain worse than the primes.</p>

When you can do 2-3 different things for every spot very effectively, that makes it extremely difficult for defenders. The more options you have per situation in terms of moves you can make, it gets exponentially harder for defenders and even for coaches to strategize against - and Luka has a deep, deep bag for every spot filled with tough shots that he can make consistently</p>

      <label for="l6mvkwy" class="commentText"><p>I think it comes down to rhythm and balance. If you have a good rhythm and you know what the other person is going to do, then you can time your moves perfectly so that you&rsquo;re always a step ahead. That&rsquo;s how Muhammad Ali was able to &ldquo;rope a dope&rdquo; George Foreman. His rhythm was flawless. Some of that is trainable, but some of it is just genetics. You need a good nervous system and brain stem to be that coordinated.</p>

You cant really explain muscle memory to someone else. Try explaining something you got good at to your past self who just started.

      <label for="l6mvgcf" class="commentText"><p>Which is hilarious to me because my high school coaches would absolutely not play anyone with a one motion shot. In practice, we&rsquo;d always scrimmage starters versus bench, and the bench would almost always win because we were shooting mostly threes coming off screens, while the starters were mostly getting &ldquo;good&rdquo; midrange shots. The difference was even more extreme for us than the NBA because we&rsquo;d play 1s and 2s instead of 2s and 3s. But this even happened in multiple games where the starters would fall behind and the bench would come back by shooting 3s, but still our primary game plan was based on getting tall guys a lightly contested ten footer.</p>

He used to take closer shots and drove to the rim more. If he never hurt his ankles he&rsquo;d still be dunking.</p>

      <label for="l6mpyl8" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s easier to understand how to get better at 3 point shooting: a shit ton of practice. Obviously, that won&rsquo;t turn you into Steph, but it&rsquo;s certainly how Steph turned into Steph. Even for stuff like contested shots, wild off-balance shots, and developing a super-quick release: those are all things you can practice by pretending there is a defender, or with an assistant coach playing that role.</p>

<p>In contrast, elite passing and court vision seems a bit different to me because it seems like you would really need other guys running around the court to effectively practice what it&rsquo;s like to find the open man and laser a precise pass to him. (Maybe this is where Luka&rsquo;s Overwatch training comes in, lol.) The physical part may be &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; but passes are always slightly different, whereas every 3 pointer is an attempt to do something exactly the same way as before, or as close as possible to it.</p>

<p>Court vision is more about basketball IQ, which you get the same as obtaining any other knowledge.</p>

<p>A lot of passes the greats make are them throwing to where guys should be as well. Which is why you see them (great passers) angry at teammates when they themselves throw it out of bounds, bc usually they made the right read.</p>

<p>I think it just seems different bc the average basketball fan hasn’t tried to practice/improve those skills vs just shooting around and getting better at shooting</p>

      <label for="l6mftrs" class="commentText"><p>Also his passing is ELITE. Do you double, or you live with him getting his teammates involved?</p>

<p>Luka make you pick a poison, add in kyrie playing off the ball and can basically do the same shit.</p>

<p>Like them Pamper commercials with the blowout barrier, either way its <strong>shit</strong> lol.</p>

      <label for="l6mbyqo" class="commentText"><p>It’s the deceleration. That’s what is so lethal. Specifically it’s the deceleration WITH ball control.</p>

<p>He can commit to a lot of angles “more athletic” players can’t commit to because he can drop anchor and decelerate better than almost anyone, maintain his dribble, and either pull up or chain into another move.</p>

<p>Most players don’t have that kind of ability. Like you said Harden similarly can just drop an anchor whenever.</p>

<p>Add a wet jumper to it and you get current Luka / Prime harden. Just a complete nightmare with the ball in their hands.</p>

      <label for="l6mm2us" class="commentText"><p>That’s part of it particularly when he already has you beat but he doesnt really fully commit to any initial move</p>

<p>He’s so tough because he has so many layered counters</p>

<p>He drove left? You have to fully commit to getting in front because if he gets you on his hip you’ve already lost due to his strength.</p>

<p>You managed to beat him to the angle so he cant turn the corner? Good job, all your momentum is heading one way and he just took a huge step back.</p>

<p>Oh shit! Step back? You somehow recover and fully close out as he’s rising to shoot? Wait, it was an up fake???? He’s driving right now???</p>

<p>Shit! He now has the angle and you’re stuck on his left hip. Even if you somehow manage fight back in front he’ll either stop on a dime to draw a foul or he’ll step back to his right for a comfortable mid range while you put all your momentum to get back in front.</p>

<p>Also he could simply crossover on the initial drive like he did Gobert.</p>

<p>He just has a deep bag and all of his stuff works together. And if you put a smaller quicker guy with the agility to react to all of this he simply overpowers them towards the rim or posts up.</p>

      <label for="l6m9piv" class="commentText"><p>He is probably the best ever in delaying his decision until the last moment, if that makes sense. He waits for the defence to give him something and then decides based on that. So often you will see him go up for a shot, defenders automatically turn to the basket to prepare for a rebound, and then he just passes it to the corner in the last moment.</p>

<p>Same goes for the fakes, it isnt the defender that is faked out, he just reacts based on what you do. If you jump forward he will fake, if you dont he will shoot.</p>

Yes it may not be the raw talent other teams have but next to Luka what you really want is an elite secondary scorer who can be offball, 3 and D wings, and rim running bigs. Lob threats, elite defense, and shooting in a primarily offball setting is the exact team Luka can take advantage of. A lot of other great players would take the ball out of his hand and not work well with this style of play.</p>

      <label for="l6m9q98" class="commentText"><p>The benefit of being slower than everyone else is you get to commit to something later than them.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, he sells everything with his entire body and has enough control over himself and the ball to opt out of something at the last moment if the defender reacts. The defender can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;not react&rdquo; because then Luka just does the thing he&rsquo;s &ldquo;faking&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s no longer a fake, right? That&rsquo;s why he ends up dancing with the best defenders, they&rsquo;re reacting very quickly but with discipline and he&rsquo;s just using more moves to gain the advantage he needs.</p>

Every athletic defender believes they&rsquo;ll beat Luka to any spot (which is probably true), but Luka know that. He sells his moves so well defenders think he&rsquo;s going a certain direction, so when the react, he stops changes directions and gets by via the space the defender created by moving on the first move.</p>

<p>For players, smaller and lighter than him, this is just more brute force. He literally bullies them to move in any direction he wants them to.</p>

Once he has a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> step on you, you can’t recover due to his frame size and strength and his ability to use it.</p>

<p>He has the handles and jump shot to make all of this work. It sounds easy and simple but its not. The combination of his size and handle is rarest part for me, most men his size simply dont have it on a string like he does which allows him to manipulate defenders positions and then use his body. Just a lethal combo</p>

      <label for="l6mpois" class="commentText"><p>Luka is bigger and stronger than most guards, so he can push them around to get to his sweet spots, and shoot over smaller guys. He also just has a really good understanding of tempo, timing, and angles, so he can find the small windows to get open or put guys in jail on his hip when defenders take 1 wrong step or lag behind just a beat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like how Dirk&rsquo;s fadeaway used his height and his knee to make it impossible for defenders to contest. Except for Luka, he&rsquo;s using his hip, his positioning, and his screener to prevent the defender from contesting.</p>

      <label for="l6mqvju" class="commentText"><p>I forgot which former NBA player who said it (Gilbert Arenas maybe?) but he was asked this same question. In full court, athleticism takes over - see Giannis and LeBron. In half court, fundamental basketball takes over. Athleticism and speed plays second stage to fundamental basketball. Reason why the Spurs were a dynasty with Duncan and Ginobili.</p>

<p>Luka has been working on his fundamentals since age 11. He has been playing against grown ups since 14. His fundamentals are the best in the game, well maybe second to Jokic.</p>

Really that simple, and you don&rsquo;t need to be fast or quick if you know what you are doing, which he always does. You cannot speed him up, rattle him, or make him play at any other pace than the one he wants to play at - which is some type of off beat rhythm to the typical NBA athlete. Jokic is very much like that.</p>

      <label for="l6mr9ib" class="commentText"><p>Apparently he has the fastest deceleration in the league. His ability to stop on a dime and halt momentum is second to none giving him time and space to execute. This can throw off any defender and gain an advantage even if he lacks the speed and explosiveness in acceleration.</p>

Now if you can do that from the 3 point line, free throw line and just under the basket you&rsquo;re already a triple threat guy. So regardless of how quick and athletic someone they will still have a hard time defending because they have to think where you are going to attack, how you are going to attack plus not fouling and trying to navigate all the other movements from the other players in the court</p>

The thing with great players is that they will end up doing what they do. Luka can straight up tell the defender what he will do and still be unstoppable. To really lock him up you have to pull in someone else to help and he either goes through both, steps back and makes an impossible looking shot or passes to the freed up player.
He doesn’t have any apparent weaknesses that you can exploit easily.</p>

When he makes a move he isn&rsquo;t moving so fast that he has to commit to it. Most players cross someone up and are under the basket half a second later. They need to shoot or pass, and sometimes they don&rsquo;t make the right decision or find themselves trapped under the basket.</p>

<p>Luka has time to get to his spot and figure out where everyone is. He can get the defense to collapse and has time to find the open man but also know he can always get an open shot </p>

      <label for="l6mqg8s" class="commentText"><p>I’ve played sports with people who are significantly faster than others. But if someone has a ridiculous 1, 2, or 3 step jump, it doesn’t matter who would win a 50 yard sprint.</p>

<p>Ant would beat Luka in a sprint. But Luka with the ball can take a quick step/step back and get a great look. So it’s largely whether or not Ant guesses the move Luka is trying right. If he’s right, Luka doesn’t get the space. If he’s wrong, he’s cooked and Luka gets a clean look.</p>
