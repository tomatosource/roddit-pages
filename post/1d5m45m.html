</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I understand that his shot is deadly and his strength is very underrated so you can’t get to close or he’ll step back  and counter from there if it’s not open (it’s almost always open) and put you on his back for the middy or floater . My question is how is he getting world class athletes like Ant to bite at his moves if they know in theory they should have the recovery speed to not have to commit to any one move and play straight up</p>

      <label for="l6mnxvx" class="commentText"><p>This is really what’s at the heart of it. If you’ve ever played basketball against someone that can really hit their step backs, it’s ALWAYS on your mind that they’re going into that move. There are guys that are really good at selling a move with their body and then changing course immediately. The combination of that (defenders preoccupation with him launching a shot + his ability to sell + his ability to change course) means that it just doesn’t matter how fast he is because the defender is off balance and out of position.</p>

<p>you can&rsquo;t guard a fadeaway unless you&rsquo;re about 3-4 inches taller than the guy.  If you&rsquo;re shorter, forget it.  The best you can do is make him uncomfortable and not let him get where he wants to get on the court. But once he&rsquo;s there and he&rsquo;s committed, then that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>The worst part about it is usually I feel like I&rsquo;ve played great defense.  I turn around, and swish, nothing I could have done better.  My teammates will look at me and shrug, say &ldquo;great defense&rdquo;.  yeah i know, but he still made it. fuck my life.</p>

      <label for="l6mrqdl" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the early era of LeBron, whichever goddamn of his 5 primes, in which people basically had to hope his jumpshot wasn&rsquo;t landing and defend him similar to how folks have to defend Giannis and that he&rsquo;s never gotten a good whistle for freethrows. </p>

<p>Grantland did a fantastic article on LeBron learning in Miami how to get to his ideal spots to shoot, drive or pass. </p>

<p>Luka has his spots but his offensive versatility means he&rsquo;s essentially dangerous with the ball anywhere on the court, including his range to send oops to teammates already near the basket. </p>

<p>Defending Luka means having to consider every option and with fantastic perimeter defence at best you might &lsquo;force&rsquo; him into stepbacks on a day when his three isn&rsquo;t falling. 
And now it seems even trying to go at him when he&rsquo;s defending and hoping to wear his legs out isn&rsquo;t as effective as it used to be. </p>

When you can do 2-3 different things for every spot very effectively, that makes it extremely difficult for defenders. The more options you have per situation in terms of moves you can make, it gets exponentially harder for defenders and even for coaches to strategize against - and Luka has a deep, deep bag for every spot filled with tough shots that he can make consistently</p>

<p>But ofc he’s also way more accurate than other players. He’s just that good. I mean even in golf isnt he good(relatively)?</p>

      <label for="l6mpyl8" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s easier to understand how to get better at 3 point shooting: a shit ton of practice. Obviously, that won&rsquo;t turn you into Steph, but it&rsquo;s certainly how Steph turned into Steph. Even for stuff like contested shots, wild off-balance shots, and developing a super-quick release: those are all things you can practice by pretending there is a defender, or with an assistant coach playing that role.</p>

<p>In contrast, elite passing and court vision seems a bit different to me because it seems like you would really need other guys running around the court to effectively practice what it&rsquo;s like to find the open man and laser a precise pass to him. (Maybe this is where Luka&rsquo;s Overwatch training comes in, lol.) The physical part may be &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; but passes are always slightly different, whereas every 3 pointer is an attempt to do something exactly the same way as before, or as close as possible to it.</p>

<p>“Guys coming from high school have trouble with help-side defence,” Shelton said. “Kawhi made a comment to coach Hutson, who was the defensive coach at the time, and he was like, ‘I don’t get it, coach. Why can’t they just stay in front of their man like I do? Like, why do I have to play help side?’ That was his only comment I ever heard him make about defence: ‘They should just be able to stay in front of their man like I do.’”</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite joker responses cos it was in an interview and he literally couldn’t describe it other than “I’ve always just been able to look at where something goes and then when I throw or chuck, it goes to that exact spot I looked at or meant for it to go. 🤷”</p>

      <label for="l6mbyqo" class="commentText"><p>It’s the deceleration. That’s what is so lethal. Specifically it’s the deceleration WITH ball control.</p>

<p>He can commit to a lot of angles “more athletic” players can’t commit to because he can drop anchor and decelerate better than almost anyone, maintain his dribble, and either pull up or chain into another move.</p>

<p>Most players don’t have that kind of ability. Like you said Harden similarly can just drop an anchor whenever.</p>

<p>Add a wet jumper to it and you get current Luka / Prime harden. Just a complete nightmare with the ball in their hands.</p>

      <label for="l6mm2us" class="commentText"><p>That’s part of it particularly when he already has you beat but he doesnt really fully commit to any initial move</p>

<p>He’s so tough because he has so many layered counters</p>

<p>He drove left? You have to fully commit to getting in front because if he gets you on his hip you’ve already lost due to his strength.</p>

<p>You managed to beat him to the angle so he cant turn the corner? Good job, all your momentum is heading one way and he just took a huge step back.</p>

<p>Oh shit! Step back? You somehow recover and fully close out as he’s rising to shoot? Wait, it was an up fake???? He’s driving right now???</p>

<p>Shit! He now has the angle and you’re stuck on his left hip. Even if you somehow manage fight back in front he’ll either stop on a dime to draw a foul or he’ll step back to his right for a comfortable mid range while you put all your momentum to get back in front.</p>

<p>Also he could simply crossover on the initial drive like he did Gobert.</p>

<p>He just has a deep bag and all of his stuff works together. And if you put a smaller quicker guy with the agility to react to all of this he simply overpowers them towards the rim or posts up.</p>

      <label for="l6m9piv" class="commentText"><p>He is probably the best ever in delaying his decision until the last moment, if that makes sense. He waits for the defence to give him something and then decides based on that. So often you will see him go up for a shot, defenders automatically turn to the basket to prepare for a rebound, and then he just passes it to the corner in the last moment.</p>

<p>Same goes for the fakes, it isnt the defender that is faked out, he just reacts based on what you do. If you jump forward he will fake, if you dont he will shoot.</p>

      <label for="l6mhaps" class="commentText"><p>I think this Mavs team is actually incredible just built towards Luka’s strengths (as it should be). Yes it may not be the raw talent other teams have but next to Luka what you really want is an elite secondary scorer who can be offball, 3 and D wings, and rim running bigs. Lob threats, elite defense, and shooting in a primarily offball setting is the exact team Luka can take advantage of. A lot of other great players would take the ball out of his hand and not work well with this style of play.</p>

<p>Although tbh defense is hard to evaluate if your team is trash because defense requires athleticism and energy and if your team sucks you have to do more and energy is limited</p>

<p>to add I believe (to a degree) people underestimate Luka&rsquo;s athleticism. Athletically speaking he&rsquo;s far closer to Ant than to a regular person.</p>

<p>So there is a makeup speed advantage but it&rsquo;s not egregious.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why he can overcome it with all the reasons listed here</p>

There’s a play in there where Luka jumps in the air with the intention of bursting one direction or another depending on the off ball screen coverage. Since he’s in the air, the defense doesn’t know his counter until immediately after he hits the ground John Stockton used to do this a lot.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, he sells everything with his entire body and has enough control over himself and the ball to opt out of something at the last moment if the defender reacts. The defender can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;not react&rdquo; because then Luka just does the thing he&rsquo;s &ldquo;faking&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s no longer a fake, right? That&rsquo;s why he ends up dancing with the best defenders, they&rsquo;re reacting very quickly but with discipline and he&rsquo;s just using more moves to gain the advantage he needs.</p>

Every athletic defender believes they&rsquo;ll beat Luka to any spot (which is probably true), but Luka know that. He sells his moves so well defenders think he&rsquo;s going a certain direction, so when the react, he stops changes directions and gets by via the space the defender created by moving on the first move.</p>

<p>For players, smaller and lighter than him, this is just more brute force. He literally bullies them to move in any direction he wants them to.</p>

Once he has a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> step on you, you can’t recover due to his frame size and strength and his ability to use it.</p>

<p>He has the handles and jump shot to make all of this work. It sounds easy and simple but its not. The combination of his size and handle is rarest part for me, most men his size simply dont have it on a string like he does which allows him to manipulate defenders positions and then use his body. Just a lethal combo</p>

He also just has a really good understanding of tempo, timing, and angles, so he can find the small windows to get open or put guys in jail on his hip when defenders take 1 wrong step or lag behind just a beat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like how Dirk&rsquo;s fadeaway used his height and his knee to make it impossible for defenders to contest. Except for Luka, he&rsquo;s using his hip, his positioning, and his screener to prevent the defender from contesting.</p>

      <label for="l6mqvju" class="commentText"><p>I forgot which former NBA player who said it (Gilbert Arenas maybe?) but he was asked this same question. In full court, athleticism takes over - see Giannis and LeBron. In half court, fundamental basketball takes over. Athleticism and speed plays second stage to fundamental basketball. Reason why the Spurs were a dynasty with Duncan and Ginobili.</p>

<p>Luka has been working on his fundamentals since age 11. He has been playing against grown ups since 14. His fundamentals are the best in the game, well maybe second to Jokic.</p>

Really that simple, and you don&rsquo;t need to be fast or quick if you know what you are doing, which he always does. You cannot speed him up, rattle him, or make him play at any other pace than the one he wants to play at - which is some type of off beat rhythm to the typical NBA athlete. Jokic is very much like that.</p>

Now if you can do that from the 3 point line, free throw line and just under the basket you&rsquo;re already a triple threat guy. So regardless of how quick and athletic someone they will still have a hard time defending because they have to think where you are going to attack, how you are going to attack plus not fouling and trying to navigate all the other movements from the other players in the court</p>

The thing with great players is that they will end up doing what they do. Luka can straight up tell the defender what he will do and still be unstoppable. To really lock him up you have to pull in someone else to help and he either goes through both, steps back and makes an impossible looking shot or passes to the freed up player.
He doesn’t have any apparent weaknesses that you can exploit easily.</p>

When he makes a move he isn&rsquo;t moving so fast that he has to commit to it. Most players cross someone up and are under the basket half a second later. They need to shoot or pass, and sometimes they don&rsquo;t make the right decision or find themselves trapped under the basket.</p>

<p>Luka has time to get to his spot and figure out where everyone is. He can get the defense to collapse and has time to find the open man but also know he can always get an open shot </p>

Nobody can kill their momentum as fast as Luka can so if he and his defender both start moving at a high speed he can stop moving and become open with a step back, his defender cannot move like that</p>

<p>Ant would beat Luka in a sprint. But Luka with the ball can take a quick step/step back and get a great look. So it’s largely whether or not Ant guesses the move Luka is trying right. If he’s right, Luka doesn’t get the space. If he’s wrong, he’s cooked and Luka gets a clean look.</p>

He also really understands tempo and changing levels of speed, you don’t really have to be fast to do this. Basically the defender has to accurately decide how fast the ball handler is moving to stay in front. A guy like Luka may not be super fast be because he’s a fantastic ball handler and changes levels so well, he’s still really hard to stay in front of. And once you get someone on your back hip it’s nearly impossible for them to get back in front of you, pair that well with Luka being strong as hell and he makes for a nightmare assignment</p>

<p>I played in JuCo and rode the bench D2, and even at that level, you get these guys where you think &ldquo;All I gotta do is not bite on the moves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all well and good until that dude beats you with a first step. Now you&rsquo;re in a position of either trying to recover, or standing still and hoping he doesn&rsquo;t take the easy lane to the basket. </p>

<p>What wins out? Usually number 1. You try to recover, dude crosses back over, you stumble, he hits a 3, everybody laughs. But he beats you with the first step anyways. He already had you.</p>

<p>Luka isnt fast but he changes direction VERY quickly</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why if you DONT bite on a guy like luka you can usually do well against him. but its SO HARD not to bite. i remember an interview with JR Smith talking about guarding Kobe. The coach would literally scream at him not to jump on the pump fake. but first play of the game what happened? kobe faked, he jumped, foul.</p>

<p>There was a clip posted on here with a defender who was so slow that he just didnt move when Luka tried to juke him. Just stood there and luka moved around a bit then passed the ball. it was hilarious. i cant remember who it was but if someone on here can find it</p>

<p>The key to a good moveset like Luka&rsquo;s isnt blow by speed. Its that it looks so good that the defender cant help but move with him to try and stay with him. thats the trap. he breaks hard and moves the other way and gets em off balance. then he uses his weight/strength to get distance and BUCKET</p>

However, with shooting, if you’re not consistently showing you can hit it deep, defenders won’t bite and sag off. Why you think teams blitz Curry and full court press him. You have to show you’re a threat and defenders will bite. You look at Gobert when he gets the ball on offense, ain’t no team cares lol. When Gobert had a mismatch, Dallas ain’t taking it seriously, no double teams etc.</p>

He understands angles and body positioning so well that he can get to a spot and immediately knows what move to employ to exploit however the defender is positioned. It’s masterful and not a lot of players play like this these days because most of these “dribblers” just spam a whole bunch of moves without properly reading the defender.</p>
