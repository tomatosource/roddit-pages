</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I understand that his shot is deadly and his strength is very underrated so you can’t get to close or he’ll step back  and counter from there if it’s not open (it’s almost always open) and put you on his back for the middy or floater . My question is how is he getting world class athletes like Ant to bite at his moves if they know in theory they should have the recovery speed to not have to commit to any one move and play straight up</p>

      <label for="l6mnxvx" class="commentText"><p>This is really what’s at the heart of it. If you’ve ever played basketball against someone that can really hit their step backs, it’s ALWAYS on your mind that they’re going into that move. There are guys that are really good at selling a move with their body and then changing course immediately. The combination of that (defenders preoccupation with him launching a shot + his ability to sell + his ability to change course) means that it just doesn’t matter how fast he is because the defender is off balance and out of position.</p>

If you&rsquo;re good at reading the person&rsquo;s body language, you can figure out what to do. But Luka is a tricky bastard.  He has enough tools in his belt to be able to keep you hesitant all the time.  Jokic isn&rsquo;t that much different.  He&rsquo;s not quick, but it seems like he always has a million options at his fingertips.</p>

<p>you can&rsquo;t guard a fadeaway unless you&rsquo;re about 3-4 inches taller than the guy.  If you&rsquo;re shorter, forget it.  The best you can do is make him uncomfortable and not let him get where he wants to get on the court. But once he&rsquo;s there and he&rsquo;s committed, then that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>The worst part about it is usually I feel like I&rsquo;ve played great defense.  I turn around, and swish, nothing I could have done better.  My teammates will look at me and shrug, say &ldquo;great defense&rdquo;.  yeah i know, but he still made it. fuck my life.</p>

<p>I have PTSD from all the fadeaways my buddy has hit in my face when we play 1 on 1. He’s 4 inches taller than me, and there’s nothing I can do unless I completely sell out for it, and if you leave your feet early, you’re boned.</p>

      <label for="l6mrqdl" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the early era of LeBron, whichever goddamn of his 5 primes, in which people basically had to hope his jumpshot wasn&rsquo;t landing and defend him similar to how folks have to defend Giannis and that he&rsquo;s never gotten a good whistle for freethrows. </p>

<p>Grantland did a fantastic article on LeBron learning in Miami how to get to his ideal spots to shoot, drive or pass. </p>

<p>Luka has his spots but his offensive versatility means he&rsquo;s essentially dangerous with the ball anywhere on the court, including his range to send oops to teammates already near the basket. </p>

<p>Defending Luka means having to consider every option and with fantastic perimeter defence at best you might &lsquo;force&rsquo; him into stepbacks on a day when his three isn&rsquo;t falling. 
And now it seems even trying to go at him when he&rsquo;s defending and hoping to wear his legs out isn&rsquo;t as effective as it used to be. </p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>I think all of the first 4 are comparable in some way to each other and all MVP level performances. But 22-23 his defense was plain worse than the primes.</p>

<p>“Guys coming from high school have trouble with help-side defence,” Shelton said. “Kawhi made a comment to coach Hutson, who was the defensive coach at the time, and he was like, ‘I don’t get it, coach. Why can’t they just stay in front of their man like I do? Like, why do I have to play help side?’ That was his only comment I ever heard him make about defence: ‘They should just be able to stay in front of their man like I do.’”</p>

You cant really explain muscle memory to someone else. Try explaining something you got good at to your past self who just started.

      <label for="l6mvgcf" class="commentText"><p>Which is hilarious to me because my high school coaches would absolutely not play anyone with a one motion shot. In practice, we&rsquo;d always scrimmage starters versus bench, and the bench would almost always win because we were shooting mostly threes coming off screens, while the starters were mostly getting &ldquo;good&rdquo; midrange shots. The difference was even more extreme for us than the NBA because we&rsquo;d play 1s and 2s instead of 2s and 3s. But this even happened in multiple games where the starters would fall behind and the bench would come back by shooting 3s, but still our primary game plan was based on getting tall guys a lightly contested ten footer.</p>

He used to take closer shots and drove to the rim more. If he never hurt his ankles he&rsquo;d still be dunking.</p>

      <label for="l6mpyl8" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s easier to understand how to get better at 3 point shooting: a shit ton of practice. Obviously, that won&rsquo;t turn you into Steph, but it&rsquo;s certainly how Steph turned into Steph. Even for stuff like contested shots, wild off-balance shots, and developing a super-quick release: those are all things you can practice by pretending there is a defender, or with an assistant coach playing that role.</p>

<p>In contrast, elite passing and court vision seems a bit different to me because it seems like you would really need other guys running around the court to effectively practice what it&rsquo;s like to find the open man and laser a precise pass to him. (Maybe this is where Luka&rsquo;s Overwatch training comes in, lol.) The physical part may be &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; but passes are always slightly different, whereas every 3 pointer is an attempt to do something exactly the same way as before, or as close as possible to it.</p>

<p>Court vision is more about basketball IQ, which you get the same as obtaining any other knowledge.</p>

<p>A lot of passes the greats make are them throwing to where guys should be as well. Which is why you see them (great passers) angry at teammates when they themselves throw it out of bounds, bc usually they made the right read.</p>

<p>I think it just seems different bc the average basketball fan hasn’t tried to practice/improve those skills vs just shooting around and getting better at shooting</p>

<p>Luka make you pick a poison, add in kyrie playing off the ball and can basically do the same shit.</p>

<p>Like them Pamper commercials with the blowout barrier, either way its <strong>shit</strong> lol.</p>

      <label for="l6mbyqo" class="commentText"><p>It’s the deceleration. That’s what is so lethal. Specifically it’s the deceleration WITH ball control.</p>

<p>He can commit to a lot of angles “more athletic” players can’t commit to because he can drop anchor and decelerate better than almost anyone, maintain his dribble, and either pull up or chain into another move.</p>

<p>Most players don’t have that kind of ability. Like you said Harden similarly can just drop an anchor whenever.</p>

<p>Add a wet jumper to it and you get current Luka / Prime harden. Just a complete nightmare with the ball in their hands.</p>

      <label for="l6mm2us" class="commentText"><p>That’s part of it particularly when he already has you beat but he doesnt really fully commit to any initial move</p>

<p>He’s so tough because he has so many layered counters</p>

<p>He drove left? You have to fully commit to getting in front because if he gets you on his hip you’ve already lost due to his strength.</p>

<p>You managed to beat him to the angle so he cant turn the corner? Good job, all your momentum is heading one way and he just took a huge step back.</p>

<p>Oh shit! Step back? You somehow recover and fully close out as he’s rising to shoot? Wait, it was an up fake???? He’s driving right now???</p>

<p>Shit! He now has the angle and you’re stuck on his left hip. Even if you somehow manage fight back in front he’ll either stop on a dime to draw a foul or he’ll step back to his right for a comfortable mid range while you put all your momentum to get back in front.</p>

<p>Also he could simply crossover on the initial drive like he did Gobert.</p>

<p>He just has a deep bag and all of his stuff works together. And if you put a smaller quicker guy with the agility to react to all of this he simply overpowers them towards the rim or posts up.</p>

      <label for="l6m9piv" class="commentText"><p>He is probably the best ever in delaying his decision until the last moment, if that makes sense. He waits for the defence to give him something and then decides based on that. So often you will see him go up for a shot, defenders automatically turn to the basket to prepare for a rebound, and then he just passes it to the corner in the last moment.</p>

<p>Same goes for the fakes, it isnt the defender that is faked out, he just reacts based on what you do. If you jump forward he will fake, if you dont he will shoot.</p>

Yes it may not be the raw talent other teams have but next to Luka what you really want is an elite secondary scorer who can be offball, 3 and D wings, and rim running bigs. Lob threats, elite defense, and shooting in a primarily offball setting is the exact team Luka can take advantage of. A lot of other great players would take the ball out of his hand and not work well with this style of play.</p>

      <label for="l6n9a98" class="commentText"><p>Ironically they are probably the two best guys on the planet at the hang dribble. And they couldn’t utilize it more differently. For Ky, that’s how he loves to initiate his iso’s because his ability to pull up in your face must be respected so that literal split second of hesitation created by the hang dribble and you’re BBQ chicken.</p>

<p>Luka on the other hand uses it primarily once he gets in the lane off a PnR especially if he’s got someone pinned in jail. His hang dribble from there is even more deadly because it’s literally a triple threat position with a live dribble—he could rise and shoot, throw a lob/kick out/clownin pass, or continue driving the lane. Again, it’s a split second but you freeze or commit in that instant and you too are cooked.</p>

<p>Rockets harden was a bit slimmer and quicker imo and didn’t generate as much space by just angling his body</p>

<p>Plus Luka’s insane court vision makes it so you can slip off your man even a bit to cover his angle bc he’ll hit your man</p>

Every athletic defender believes they&rsquo;ll beat Luka to any spot (which is probably true), but Luka know that. He sells his moves so well defenders think he&rsquo;s going a certain direction, so when the react, he stops changes directions and gets by via the space the defender created by moving on the first move.</p>

<p>For players, smaller and lighter than him, this is just more brute force. He literally bullies them to move in any direction he wants them to.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, he sells everything with his entire body and has enough control over himself and the ball to opt out of something at the last moment if the defender reacts. The defender can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;not react&rdquo; because then Luka just does the thing he&rsquo;s &ldquo;faking&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s no longer a fake, right? That&rsquo;s why he ends up dancing with the best defenders, they&rsquo;re reacting very quickly but with discipline and he&rsquo;s just using more moves to gain the advantage he needs.</p>

      <label for="l6mj9ms" class="commentText"><p>i feel like jokic is like this too. he broadcasts every move he is about to make and moves in slow motion. it’s a mind game for his defenders because he could very well go in for that obvious layup or do something completely unexpected like a sideways pass across the court, or just nail a 3 pointer with that freakish caveman shot. as a defender you have no choice but to do the dance with him.</p>

He might not move around as quickly as Kyrie but his hesis, crosses and whatnot are quick and abrupt enough to throw people off.

      <label for="l6nqst9" class="commentText"><p>I think so much of this is size based too. At 6&rsquo; 7&rdquo; he can cover so much more ground than a typical 6&rsquo; 2&rdquo; guard can so one step has him traveling a farther distance, and then his step back is longer, his shot fake feels even more like a real shot because the ball is going up more, etc. All his movements are just ever so much more exaggerated and then the defender is scrambling to cover and as soon as you lean too far or take one extra step or leave your feet you&rsquo;re completely cooked.</p>

<p>Look at his shot against Gobert. He doesn&rsquo;t do <em>that</em> much, but his legs get so far apart that in a still frame you&rsquo;d think he was sprinting toward the baseline. Gobert just turns his body to follow him towards the lane, then it&rsquo;s stepback city and ballgame.</p>

      <label for="l6mif3g" class="commentText"><p>He uses accels and deccels perfectly. He waits until a defender’s momentum is going the opposite way before moving. Playing slower allows him to notice things like defenders momentum and stance etc and then exploit it. Once he has a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> step on you, you can’t recover due to his frame size and strength and his excellent understanding of how to use it.</p>

<p>He has the handles and jump shot to make all of this work. It sounds easy and simple but its not. The combination of his size and handle is rarest part for me, most men his size simply dont have it on a string like he does which allows him to manipulate defenders positions and then use his body. Just a lethal combo</p>

He also just has a really good understanding of tempo, timing, and angles, so he can find the small windows to get open or put guys in jail on his hip when defenders take 1 wrong step or lag behind just a beat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like how Dirk&rsquo;s fadeaway used his height and his knee to make it impossible for defenders to contest. Except for Luka, he&rsquo;s using his hip, his positioning, and his screener to prevent the defender from contesting.</p>

In full court, athleticism takes over - see Giannis and LeBron. In half court, fundamental basketball takes over. Athleticism and speed plays second stage to fundamental basketball. Reason why the Spurs were a dynasty with Duncan and Ginobili.</p>

<p>Luka has been working on his fundamentals since age 11. He has been playing against grown ups since 14. His fundamentals are the best in the game, well maybe second to Jokic.</p>

      <label for="l6mjk79" class="commentText"><p>strong</p>

<p>very smart</p>

<p>extremely good deceleration ability</p>
