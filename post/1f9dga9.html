      <p>What were some NBA role players who were quickly out the league or didn‚Äôt last long?</p>

<p>One Player would be Daequan Cook, He went from winning the NBA 3 point contest in his 2nd season to being out of the NBA 4 years later around the age of 25. I mean He did have a terrible FG%.</p>

<p>Not sure If I should include players with injuries but Another one would be Jeremy Lin, He only lasted 9 years and was out the NBA due to injuries that affected his game</p>

The average NBA career lasts 8.2 years, so saying Jeremy Lin ‚Äúonly lasted 9 years‚Äù is once again incorrect and pretty idiotic.</p>

He‚Äôs also one of the most one-dimensional players I‚Äôve seen, Shooting was the only thing he could do. Good passer but everything else was mediocre</p>

I understand the weight problems and I‚Äôm not gonna act like he was going to last forever but he only played 269 games (172 starts) in a 5 year career. Just weird that he went from being a decent starting big man on a couple playoff teams to out of the league in the span of 2 years and all of this by the end of his age 24 season. Add on that he was a top recruit and was projected to go top 3 if he‚Äôd left school a year earlier and it feels odd that he was done so quick</p>
