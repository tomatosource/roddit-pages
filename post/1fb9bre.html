</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We all know Minnesota passed on Steph Curry, not once, but twice in 2009. But why did we even have the chance to pass on him twice?</p>

<p>The Wizards <strong>traded</strong> the 5th overall pick away to the Wolves in a draft that had stars Blake Griffin, James Harden, Steph Curry, DeMar DeRozan, Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, and Tyler Hansborough (IYKYK, GOATBOROUGH). And yes, the Wolves blew it on all of these guys except Blake and Harden.</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;traded&rdquo; but the return for this pick feels sub-par: Randy Foye and Mike Miller. Mike Mill was on the cusp of 29 years old, averaging 9.9 PPG on a terrible MN team. Randy Foye was entering his 4th season, coming off of a somewhat respectable 16.3 PPG season. He would never reach this level of scoring in his career again.</p>

<p>Hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> of course, but Foye, the &ldquo;better&rdquo; asset of the two only played one season in Washington before moving onto the Clippers. I just feel like this doesn&rsquo;t ever get mentioned. Any insights?</p>

So, he inherited a good roster and great coach and basically drove them into the ground except for one good free agent signing that was almost certainly luck.</p>

      <label for="llzbg1o" class="commentText"><p>Foye had come off a season of 16 PPG and had averaged 19 PPG in February and March. It was the best he had looked in his career to that point and given he was 25, there was thought he was going to continue improving (he didn&rsquo;t) and would have been a high functioning 6th man or starter in case Arenas got hurt (he wasn&rsquo;t either). Mike Miller was a good player who averaged 16+ in Memphis for two seasons but got super passive in Minnesota in 2009 and never really reverted back into a 3rd option type on offense after that.</p>

<p>The Wizards were able to jet some shitty contracts on Minnesota as we were fully going into tank command mode. Etan Thomas and Darius Songalia combined to make $12 mil bucks in &lsquo;10 and Songalia had extra years beyond that.</p>

<p>Washington got to make a salary dump, trade a first, and get back two players that would have worked (in theory) with Flip&rsquo;s offense pretty well. From Washington&rsquo;s perspective, I get why they made the move. It just didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Maybe Wizards just don&rsquo;t see any of the prospects to be better than those assets.</p>

<p>You can apply that in this year&rsquo;s 2024 draft. 5th pick is Ron Holland. No one here will think Holland will be a superstar. But We never know, he might be in the future.</p>

<p>If Pistons traded their 5th pick for an asset, that will look fine. UNLESS, Holland became a Superstar.(Hypothetical, but yeah)</p>

<p>Steph was so tiny when he got drafted. The NBA was not what it is today. Shooting wasn&rsquo;t really a priority. Post play was.</p>

<p>The NBA is what it is today because of the breakout Steph and the Warriors had (to a lesser extent the Steve Nash led Suns)</p>

<p>Nobody knew Steph would turn out to be Steph, but he definitely had people who were huge on him. He was seen as someone who had bust potential (due to his size and playing in a mid-major) but also had some of the highest star potential in that draft. Knicks fans (who were drafting at 8, one spot after Golden State) were frothing at the mouth at the prospect of potentially drafting him, to put into perspective what the kind of hype around Steph was like at the time.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re forgetting one very critical problem Curry had: He was injury prone as fuck. At one point the material in his knees was kindly referred to as &ldquo;paper mache&rdquo;. This plagued the first half of his career. He could have easily been another Porzingis, but it turned out in a different way.</p>

      <label for="llyxrjm" class="commentText"><p>The pick was too high, imo, for a couple of solid role players in Miller and Foye, but the Wizards were trying to add depth because they had playoff aspirations. They still had their same starting 5 that they had forever with Arenas, Stevenson, Butler, Jamison, and Haywood. Plus, adding Foye and Miller to the bench to go along with young prospects like Nick Young, Andray Blatche, and Javale McGee gave them good depth. Then the Arenas gun incident happened, and their entire team imploded, the whole starting 5 outside of Arenas were traded at the trade deadline, and they ended up finishing 19-63. They ended up getting John Wall with the first pick as a result of that tumultuous season, so it worked out in the end.</p>

      <label for="llyycge" class="commentText"><p>A large part of it was Abe Pollin was dying and they wanted to squeeze one more playoff run out the Arenas/Jamison/Butler core even if all the evidence overwhelmingly suggested that they were DONE(!). Plus they had had success trading the 5th pick in the very recent past. They traded the 5th pick in the ‘04 draft that would be Devin Harris for Jamison, which kicked off this mini-renaissance for DC basketball (by Bullets/Wizards standards). And to circle back to the original point, Pollin was extremely loyal — to a fault at times — that if you did right by him, he would stick it out with you until the wheels fell off. Not a particular great in terms of winning at professional sports but it engendered a lot of good will within and around DC (and something that Leonsis tried to replicate but failed at because there’s literally no authenticity behind it).</p>

      <label for="llz2glq" class="commentText"><p>As others have mentioned, Steph was not guaranteed to become the Steph we know today. Just another in a long line of “player no one knew would be a HOF level player gets drafted behind career-long journeyman”. It happens all the time.</p>

<p>The Wizards thinking at the time was to run it back one more time with Arenas-Jamison-Butler, a core that had made the playoffs four straight years after only one trip in the previous 15. The Wizards struggled hard without Arenas in 08-09 due to injury.  They didn’t have time for a player to develop, and there were no guarantees that Ricky Rubio would come stateside immediately (and he spent the next two years in Spain). Foye was seen as someone who could allow Arenas to rest as a PG during games, Miller was steady and dependable, you knew exactly what he was going to give you.</p>

<p>It all went sideways when Arenas and Crittenton had their beef and brought guns to the office. Arenas was suspended for the year, the team couldn’t compete without him, and injuries piled up to truly kill the season.</p>

<p>So yes, in hindsight the Wizards look dumb for passing on Rubio or even Curry, but in the moment, they had some logic to the move.</p>

<p>Many teams didn&rsquo;t use to know how valuable draft picks were. There are so many trades in the past where teams just gave them away.</p>

      <label for="llz9mf7" class="commentText"><p>Wizards poorly evaluated their talent, particularly at the top and went into Win Now Mode.. Their thinking may have gone like this - Gilbert Arenas was coming back from injury and they still had Butler and Jamison. He only played 2 games the season before which was why they were terrible.  Valuable role players like Foye and Miller could be enough to take the next step. Any rookie available at 5 would not be that, in their minds.</p>

      <label for="llzaaay" class="commentText"><p>Funny as it sounds in hindsight, Wizards at the moment believed that they &ldquo;are one or two pieces away&rdquo;. That piece was supposed to be mainly a point guard to have Arenas focus on scoring and perimeter shooting at the time.</p>

<p>The idea was basically: we were 5th in the conference the previous season. Now we got lottery pick completely randomly because Arenas and Haywood were injured the whole season and that result doesn&rsquo;t count (and as we know from Reddit comments on everything - losing with injured players is basically like winning if you think about it), but this lottery pick is not in our &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; because we can add a few pieces and jump from being 5th in conference to contending now.</p>

<p>Also, 2009 draft was seen as not a very strong one, with some players with potential but little guarantee they will star in NBA.</p>

<p>Although today it&rsquo;s easy to laugh, that was the reasoning, and the general optimism is something you can see every season. &ldquo;Oh, team X was injured, but now they will be not, and also now they got a good coach, and they will surround player X with shooters, the player X will become much better when he has supporting cast and can focus on his stuff because that&rsquo;s how basketball teams work - now they will obviously be winning&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It can be described in the end as flipping Curry for Foye and Miller, but in terms of value, the pick was mostly the price Wizards paid to exchange deadweight contracts for someone playable. They were trying to keep the team from bottoming out by using the pick.</p>

<p>They felt Arenas, Butler and Jamison is too much &ldquo;talent&rdquo; to just let it sink.</p>

      <label for="llzd3c7" class="commentText"><p>I remember this deal in real time.  I saw it on hoops hype.  At the time wizards lost Gilbert to injuries for the last two seasons but still had a playoff talented roster. Foye had a good season showed improvement.  Mike miller was like injured even though he played 70ish games he only started like 40.  Miller was an above average starter during that trade.  Hindsight was <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> but it wasn’t that bad of a trade in the time.  Of course now you’d be like just draft curry but no one knew curry would be this good some even had Johnny Flynn and Brandon Jennings ranked over him pre draft.</p>
