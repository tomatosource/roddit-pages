</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We all know Minnesota passed on Steph Curry, not once, but twice in 2009. But why did we even have the chance to pass on him twice?</p>

<p>The Wizards <strong>traded</strong> the 5th overall pick away to the Wolves in a draft that had stars Blake Griffin, James Harden, Steph Curry, DeMar DeRozan, Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, and Tyler Hansborough (IYKYK, GOATBOROUGH). And yes, the Wolves blew it on all of these guys except Blake and Harden.</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;traded&rdquo; but the return for this pick feels sub-par: Randy Foye and Mike Miller. Mike Mill was on the cusp of 29 years old, averaging 9.9 PPG on a terrible MN team. Randy Foye was entering his 4th season, coming off of a somewhat respectable 16.3 PPG season. He would never reach this level of scoring in his career again.</p>

<p>Hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> of course, but Foye, the &ldquo;better&rdquo; asset of the two only played one season in Washington before moving onto the Clippers. I just feel like this doesn&rsquo;t ever get mentioned. Any insights?</p>

He did sign Mason but he also put them in perma-cap hell with the Smith/Grandma trades and Houston signing. Zero of the picks he did make were NBA rotation guys of any note. So, he inherited a good roster and great coach and basically drove them into the ground except for one good free agent signing that was almost certainly luck.</p>

      <label for="llzbg1o" class="commentText"><p>Foye had come off a season of 16 PPG and had averaged 19 PPG in February and March. It was the best he had looked in his career to that point and given he was 25, there was thought he was going to continue improving (he didn&rsquo;t) and would have been a high functioning 6th man or starter in case Arenas got hurt (he wasn&rsquo;t either). Mike Miller was a good player who averaged 16+ in Memphis for two seasons but got super passive in Minnesota in 2009 and never really reverted back into a 3rd option type on offense after that.</p>

<p>The Wizards were able to jet some shitty contracts on Minnesota as we were fully going into tank command mode. Etan Thomas and Darius Songalia combined to make $12 mil bucks in &lsquo;10 and Songalia had extra years beyond that.</p>

<p>Washington got to make a salary dump, trade a first, and get back two players that would have worked (in theory) with Flip&rsquo;s offense pretty well. From Washington&rsquo;s perspective, I get why they made the move. It just didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Steph was good, but not as great as we know today.</p>

<p>Maybe Wizards just don&rsquo;t see any of the prospects to be better than those assets.</p>

<p>You can apply that in this year&rsquo;s 2024 draft. 5th pick is Ron Holland. No one here will think Holland will be a superstar. But We never know, he might be in the future.</p>

<p>If Pistons traded their 5th pick for an asset, that will look fine. UNLESS, Holland became a Superstar.(Hypothetical, but yeah)</p>

<p>Nobody knew Steph would turn out to be Steph, but he definitely had people who were huge on him. He was seen as someone who had bust potential (due to his size and playing in a mid-major) but also had some of the highest star potential in that draft. Knicks fans (who were drafting at 8, one spot after Golden State) were frothing at the mouth at the prospect of potentially drafting him, to put into perspective what the kind of hype around Steph was like at the time.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re forgetting one very critical problem Curry had: He was injury prone as fuck. At one point the material in his ankles was kindly referred to as &ldquo;paper mache&rdquo;. This plagued the first half of his career. He could have easily been another Porzingis, but it turned out in a different way.</p>

I think today we&rsquo;ve lost some perspective of how stellar his run at Davidson was. We&rsquo;ve gotten spoiled, but the Curry we have now is the same guy on display at Davidson. It was amazing seeing this scrawny guy from a tiny school with like 4000 students  hit these incredible shots, again and again, with such confidence over these big name schools. </p>

<p>Davidson was living in the future, the NBA just didnt see it yet</p>

      <label for="llzu5df" class="commentText"><p>I think this is revisionist tbh. Steph went to a small school and was projected to go #8 to the Knicks. He was also an older rookie, coupled with questions of whether his game would actually translate to the pros.</p>

<p>Obviously the scouts were wrong but he was ranked as 3rd best PG in the draft. Even 3 seasons into his career, there were questions of whether he could stay healthy. Hell there was an actual debate on whether the Warriors should keep him or stick with Monte Ellis. But you never know what can happen, Steph became a star and the rest is history!</p>

<p>Steph was so tiny when he got drafted. The NBA was not what it is today. Shooting wasn&rsquo;t really a priority. Post play was.</p>

<p>The NBA is what it is today because of the breakout Steph and the Warriors had (to a lesser extent the Steve Nash led Suns)</p>

<p>It was 2008, not 1988. The revolution was well underway. There&rsquo;s obviously been a significant increase in 3 point shooting since Steph&rsquo;s stardom, but it was on the rise and post play was on life support by the time Steph got drafted.</p>

<p>Midrange attempts were down, 3 point attempts up steadily for years before Steph hit the league.</p>

<p>Flynn is the headscratcher, a pick that was only made because the Wolves had a gaping hole for a facilitating point guard even though they&rsquo;d just picked one because they knew he wouldn&rsquo;t come over for a while. The &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; around Steph was that he might not be able to do traditional point guard at all. Of course that was terrible decision making - basketball as a whole generally has a much better sense nowadays to just take the best player and worry about fit later but even then Flynn was a but of a reach</p>

      <label for="llzxarx" class="commentText"><p>People forget that Jonny Flynn was coming off a HUGE March showing, particularly in the Big East tournament. He was the first player to win Tournament MVP on a losing team since 1996, and had a showcase game for the ages when he put up 34 and 11 including 16-16 from the line in 67(!) minutes during an absurd 6-OT quarterfinal upset of a loaded UConn team. (Fun tidbit, Kemba Walker played 52 mins directly opposite Flynn and went 4-18 for 8 points)</p>

<p>I mentioned Kemba not just for narrative symmetry but because it seems like a fair comp. Undersized point guard coming off an epic March performance. If you squint your eyes a bit, I think there&rsquo;s a universe where things break differently and Flynn has something like Kemba&rsquo;s career. Hell, their rookie season per-36 numbers are virtually identical (actually Flynn has a reasonable edge in efficiency although that&rsquo;s not saying too much).</p>

<p>Somewhere in his second year, Jonny hurt his hip. I&rsquo;ve never been super clear on the exact sequence of events that followed but I believe he tried to play through it, made it worse, eventually got surgery, tried to come back too early and ended up re injuring himself again.</p>

<p>That off-season while he was still rehabbing, Rubio over from Spain&hellip; so Flynn got traded to a Rockets team that already had Kyle Lowry, Goran Dragic and Earl Boykins. He played like a hundred total minutes until the deadline where he was moved to Portland&hellip;where again he had a limited path to minutes behind Raymond Felton and Jamal Crawford. At some point he got hurt again, and just never got his lateral mobility back. At his size, that meant his career was over.</p>

<p>All this to say, yeah of course Flynn ended up being a bad pick, but I think history has been unkind to him for reasons outside his control. Obviously having the greatest shooter of all time taken immediately after you would make pretty much anyone who ISN&rsquo;T an all-timer seem like a schmuck, but it&rsquo;s not as though he was fundamentally unsuited to the league. Coin flips on the other side and maybe Jonny is the one with a couple All Star appearances and Kemba is the one who got injured early in a way that derailed his career as a sophomore.</p>

Everyone now takes the position that his deal was one of the historic underpays. Which in hindsight it was. But I remember all the talking heads and social media. The internet never forgets.</p>

      <label for="llyycge" class="commentText"><p>A large part of it was Abe Pollin was dying and they wanted to squeeze one more playoff run out the Arenas/Jamison/Butler core even if all the evidence overwhelmingly suggested that they were DONE(!). Plus they had had success trading the 5th pick in the very recent past. They traded the 5th pick in the ‘04 draft that would be Devin Harris for Jamison, which kicked off this mini-renaissance for DC basketball (by Bullets/Wizards standards). And to circle back to the original point, Pollin was extremely loyal — to a fault at times — that if you did right by him, he would stick it out with you until the wheels fell off. Not a particular great in terms of winning at professional sports but it engendered a lot of good will within and around DC (and something that Leonsis tried to replicate but failed at because there’s literally no authenticity behind it).</p>

      <label for="llyxrjm" class="commentText"><p>The pick was too high, imo, for a couple of solid role players in Miller and Foye, but the Wizards were trying to add depth because they had playoff aspirations. They still had their same starting 5 that they had forever with Arenas, Stevenson, Butler, Jamison, and Haywood. Plus, adding Foye and Miller to the bench to go along with young prospects like Nick Young, Andray Blatche, and Javale McGee gave them good depth. Then the Arenas gun incident happened, and their entire team imploded, the whole starting 5 outside of Arenas were traded at the trade deadline, and they ended up finishing 19-63. They ended up getting John Wall with the first pick as a result of that tumultuous season, so it worked out in the end.</p>

<p>He was the #7 pick just a few years earlier and was on the rise, scoring 16 PPG the season before. He was elite in college and people thought he was just starting to blossom in the NBA.</p>

<p>Obviously that didn&rsquo;t happen but this trade wasn&rsquo;t seen as lopsided at the time.</p>

At the time wizards lost Gilbert to injuries for the last two seasons but still had a playoff talented roster. Foye had a good season showed improvement.  Mike miller was like injured even though he played 70ish games he only started like 40.  Miller was an above average starter during that trade.  Hindsight was <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> but it wasn’t that bad of a trade in the time.  Of course now you’d be like just draft curry but no one knew curry would be this good some even had Johnny Flynn and Brandon Jennings ranked over him pre draft.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this trade the Wizards accomplish several important things. They pawn off several big salary players on the Twolves, which frees up money to put towards signing free agents this summer. This also alleviates the Wizards&rsquo; of several dead weight players.  Though Thomas is a force as a rebounder, the undersized center is injury prone and an offensive liability.  As for the foreign forwards, Songaila and Pecherov&rsquo;s shared shooting ability might have been what brought them to the Wizards but would&rsquo;ve unlikely been a focal point in Saunders&rsquo; offense. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In making this trade the Wizards are showing that they have faith that Javale McGee, their 18th pick in the 2008 draft, and veteran Brendan Haywood can competitively share minutes at center.  It also reiterates the front office&rsquo;s undying trust in the &ldquo;big three&rdquo; of Arenas, Butler and Jamison.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="llz2glq" class="commentText"><p>As others have mentioned, Steph was not guaranteed to become the Steph we know today. Just another in a long line of “player no one knew would be a HOF level player gets drafted behind career-long journeyman”. It happens all the time.</p>

<p>The Wizards thinking at the time was to run it back one more time with Arenas-Jamison-Butler, a core that had made the playoffs four straight years after only one trip in the previous 15. The Wizards struggled hard without Arenas in 08-09 due to injury.  They didn’t have time for a player to develop, and there were no guarantees that Ricky Rubio would come stateside immediately (and he spent the next two years in Spain). Foye was seen as someone who could allow Arenas to rest as a PG during games, Miller was steady and dependable, you knew exactly what he was going to give you.</p>

<p>It all went sideways when Arenas and Crittenton had their beef and brought guns to the office. Arenas was suspended for the year, the team couldn’t compete without him, and injuries piled up to truly kill the season.</p>

<p>So yes, in hindsight the Wizards look dumb for passing on Rubio or even Curry, but in the moment, they had some logic to the move.</p>

      <label for="llz9mf7" class="commentText"><p>Wizards poorly evaluated their talent, particularly at the top and went into Win Now Mode.. Their thinking may have gone like this - Gilbert Arenas was coming back from injury and they still had Butler and Jamison. He only played 2 games the season before which was why they were terrible.  Valuable role players like Foye and Miller could be enough to take the next step. Any rookie available at 5 would not be that, in their minds.</p>

      <label for="llzaaay" class="commentText"><p>Funny as it sounds in hindsight, Wizards at the moment believed that they &ldquo;are one or two pieces away&rdquo;. That piece was supposed to be mainly a point guard to have Arenas focus on scoring and perimeter shooting at the time.</p>

<p>The idea was basically: we were 5th in the conference the previous season. Now we got lottery pick completely randomly because Arenas and Haywood were injured the whole season and that result doesn&rsquo;t count (and as we know from Reddit comments on everything - losing with injured players is basically like winning if you think about it), but this lottery pick is not in our &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; because we can add a few pieces and jump from being 5th in conference to contending now.</p>

<p>Also, 2009 draft was seen as not a very strong one, with some players with potential but little guarantee they will star in NBA.</p>

<p>Although today it&rsquo;s easy to laugh, that was the reasoning, and the general optimism is something you can see every season. &ldquo;Oh, team X was injured, but now they will be not, and also now they got a good coach, and they will surround player X with shooters, the player X will become much better when he has supporting cast and can focus on his stuff because that&rsquo;s how basketball teams work - now they will obviously be winning&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It can be described in the end as flipping Curry for Foye and Miller, but in terms of value, the pick was mostly the price Wizards paid to exchange deadweight contracts for someone playable. They were trying to keep the team from bottoming out by using the pick.</p>

<p>They felt Arenas, Butler and Jamison is too much &ldquo;talent&rdquo; to just let it sink.</p>
