</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We all know Minnesota passed on Steph Curry, not once, but twice in 2009. But why did we even have the chance to pass on him twice?</p>

<p>The Wizards <strong>traded</strong> the 5th overall pick away to the Wolves in a draft that had stars Blake Griffin, James Harden, Steph Curry, DeMar DeRozan, Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, and Tyler Hansborough (IYKYK, GOATBOROUGH). And yes, the Wolves blew it on all of these guys except Blake and Harden.</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;traded&rdquo; but the return for this pick feels sub-par: Randy Foye and Mike Miller. Mike Mill was on the cusp of 29 years old, averaging 9.9 PPG on a terrible MN team. Randy Foye was entering his 4th season, coming off of a somewhat respectable 16.3 PPG season. He would never reach this level of scoring in his career again.</p>

<p>Hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> of course, but Foye, the &ldquo;better&rdquo; asset of the two only played one season in Washington before moving onto the Clippers. I just feel like this doesn&rsquo;t ever get mentioned. Any insights?</p>

<p>In fact, early in their career, they were not. Though Harden was a 6th Man of the year level player. He was still 6th Man.</p>

<p>Steph was good, but not as great as we know today.</p>

<p>Maybe Wizards just don&rsquo;t see any of the prospects to be better than those assets.</p>

<p>You can apply that in this year&rsquo;s 2024 draft. 5th pick is Ron Holland. No one here will think Holland will be a superstar. But We never know, he might be in the future.</p>

<p>If Pistons traded their 5th pick for an asset, that will look fine. UNLESS, Holland became a Superstar.(Hypothetical, but yeah)</p>

<p>Steph was so tiny when he got drafted. The NBA was not what it is today. Shooting wasn&rsquo;t really a priority. Post play was.</p>

<p>The NBA is what it is today because of the breakout Steph and the Warriors had (to a lesser extent the Steve Nash led Suns)</p>

<p>Nobody knew Steph would turn out to be Steph, but he definitely had people who were huge on him. He was seen as someone who had bust potential (due to his size and playing in a mid-major) but also had some of the highest star potential in that draft. Knicks fans (who were drafting at 8, one spot after Golden State) were frothing at the mouth at the prospect of potentially drafting him, to put into perspective what the kind of hype around Steph was like at the time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that they took two PGs back-to-back, and to top it off <em>neither</em> of them were Steph Curry. Steph being picked <em>right after</em> their own double PG selections makes it sting that much more</p>

      <label for="llyxrjm" class="commentText"><p>The pick was too high, imo, for a couple of solid role players in Miller and Foye, but the Wizards were trying to add depth because they had playoff aspirations. They still had their same starting 5 that they had forever with Arenas, Stevenson, Butler, Jamison, and Haywood. Plus, adding Foye and Miller to the bench to go along with young prospects like Nick Young, Andray Blatche, and Javale McGee gave them good depth. Then the Arenas gun incident happened, and their entire team imploded, the whole starting 5 outside of Arenas were traded at the trade deadline, and they ended up finishing 19-63. They ended up getting John Wall with the first pick as a result of that tumultuous season, so it worked out in the end.</p>

      <label for="llyycge" class="commentText"><p>A large part of it was Abe Pollin was dying and they wanted to squeeze one more playoff run out the Arenas/Jamison/Butler core even if all the evidence overwhelmingly suggested that they were DONE(!). Plus they had had success trading the 5th pick in the very recent past. They traded the 5th pick in the ‘04 draft that would be Devin Harris for Jamison, which kicked off this mini-renaissance for DC basketball (by Bullets/Wizards standards). And to circle back to the original point, Pollin was extremely loyal — to a fault at times — that if you did right by him, he would stick it out with you until the wheels fell off. Not a particular great in terms of winning at professional sports but it engendered a lot of good will within and around DC (and something that Leonsis tried to replicate but failed at because there’s literally no authenticity behind it).</p>

      <label for="llyypuq" class="commentText"><p>Not sure where I read this but I believe this was an ownership trade, where then owner Abe Pollin wanted to compete for a championship (with Miller and Foye? I know lol) before he passed, so it was purely a win-now move that looks awful in hindsight.</p>

      <label for="llz2glq" class="commentText"><p>As others have mentioned, Steph was not guaranteed to become the Steph we know today. Just another in a long line of “player no one knew would be a HOF level player gets drafted behind career-long journeyman”. It happens all the time.</p>

<p>The Wizards thinking at the time was to run it back one more time with Arenas-Jamison-Butler, a core that had made the playoffs four straight years after only one trip in the previous 15. The Wizards struggled hard without Arenas in 08-09 due to injury.  They didn’t have time for a player to develop, and there were no guarantees that Ricky Rubio would come stateside immediately (and he spent the next two years in Spain). Foye was seen as someone who could allow Arenas to rest as a PG during games, Miller was steady and dependable, you knew exactly what he was going to give you.</p>

<p>It all went sideways when Arenas and Crittenton had their beef and brought guns to the office. Arenas was suspended for the year, the team couldn’t compete without him, and injuries piled up to truly kill the season.</p>

<p>So yes, in hindsight the Wizards look dumb for passing on Rubio or even Curry, but in the moment, they had some logic to the move.</p>
