</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We all know Minnesota passed on Steph Curry, not once, but twice in 2009. But why did we even have the chance to pass on him twice?</p>

<p>The Wizards <strong>traded</strong> the 5th overall pick away to the Wolves in a draft that had stars Blake Griffin, James Harden, Steph Curry, DeMar DeRozan, Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, and Tyler Hansborough (IYKYK, GOATBOROUGH). And yes, the Wolves blew it on all of these guys except Blake and Harden.</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;traded&rdquo; but the return for this pick feels sub-par: Randy Foye and Mike Miller. Mike Mill was on the cusp of 29 years old, averaging 9.9 PPG on a terrible MN team. Randy Foye was entering his 4th season, coming off of a somewhat respectable 16.3 PPG season. He would never reach this level of scoring in his career again.</p>

<p>Hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> of course, but Foye, the &ldquo;better&rdquo; asset of the two only played one season in Washington before moving onto the Clippers. I just feel like this doesn&rsquo;t ever get mentioned. Any insights?</p>

He did sign Mason but he also put them in perma-cap hell with the Smith/Grandma trades and Houston signing. Zero of the picks he did make were NBA rotation guys of any note. So, he inherited a good roster and great coach and basically drove them into the ground except for one good free agent signing that was almost certainly luck.</p>

      <label for="lm1i6jb" class="commentText"><p>This is all sorts of wrong. Source: Knicks fan of 30 years. Let me explain.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Grunfeld oversaw the Knicks during the rise of the Riley years in the early-to-mid 90s, and then pulled off not one but <em>two</em> brilliant mid-stream turnarounds to breathe new life into the fading contender in the mid-to-late 90s. Grunfeld is NOT the guy who fucked the Knicks&rsquo; salary cap for a decade with the albatross Houston contract, Ewing trade, and other absolutely horrible moves&ndash; that was Scott Layden, and then his successor Isiah Thomas.</p>

<hr>

<p>Grunfeld was co-GM of the Knicks in the 1990-91 season. He inherited Ewing and Oakley from the 1990 team which won 45 games under coach Stu Jackson. In the 1990 offseason they signed John Starks, and in the 1991 offseason they signed Pat Riley as coach (although it&rsquo;s unclear how big of a role Grunfeld played in those acquisitions).</p>

<p>From the 1991-92 season onwards, Grunfeld is listed as the main executive / GM by both Basketball Reference and Wikipedia, although to be fair Dave Checketts was also very involved in the decision making around this time. Of course, this was during the rise of the Knicks as a 90s powerhouse. Key transactions include signing Anthony Mason and trading for Xavier McDaniel in 1991, drafting Hubert Davis and trading for Charles Smith (admittedly a dud) and Doc Rivers in 1992, and trading for Derek Harper and drafting Charlie Ward in 1994. During this time the Knicks went from 45 wins to 51, 60, and 57 en route to narrowly missing out on a championship in the 1994 Finals.</p>

<p>The Knicks kept the formula going in 1995 but lost in the 2nd round to the Pacers in a tough 7 game series, and Pat Riley left that offseason. They signed another legendary coach Don Nelson to replace him, but it didn&rsquo;t work out. Nelson was fired halfway through the season and the Knicks won only 47 games.</p>

<p>This is where Grunfeld made a genius mid-season pivot, trading away Charles Smith, Monty Williams, Doug Christie, and Herb Williams for expiring contracts. That opened up the cap space with which the Knicks signed Allan Houston, Chris Childs, and Buck Williams in the 1996 offseason, and they also traded Mason for LJ that offseason. In one fell swoop, he transformed what looked like a sinking ship into a completely restocked roster that, IMO, was easily the best all-around team Ewing ever had around him. What you have to appreciate is that trading for expiring contracts to open up cap space and become a player in free agency wasn&rsquo;t a commonplace strategy at the time. It was an inspired move that seamlessly turned things around overnight. And it wasn&rsquo;t some years-long strategy, it was an improvised mid-stream turnaround to salvage a situation gone wrong.</p>

<p>What happened the next couple of seasons was just bad luck. In the 1997 playoffs the Knicks were up 3-1 against the Heat, but after PJ Brown literally picked up and body slammed Charlie Ward while fighting for a rebound, the Knicks&rsquo; bench cleared. There were so many suspensions for the Knicks that they were spread out over game 6 and game 7, meaning the Knicks were missing at least 2 key players in both pivotal games, and they lost the series as a result despite being the clearly better team. A shame, because they were clicking on all cylinders and were probably the best iteration of the 90s Knicks. Probably still would have lost to the 69-win Bulls in the next round, but they&rsquo;d have given them a tougher fight than anyone else did that playoffs.</p>

<p>Then in on December 20 of the 1997-98 season, Ewing was shoved in mid-air on an alley oop attempt and shattered his shooting wrist on the landing. He missed the rest of the regular season. He returned mid-way through the Knicks&rsquo; 2nd round series against the Pacers but wasn&rsquo;t fully himself and the Knicks lost.</p>

<p>So the Knicks had a quick fall from grace following the 1994 Finals, made a brilliant recovery, but then had another quick fall from grace. But Grunfeld managed to make a brilliant recovery <em>yet again</em>, this time trading Starks for Sprewell and Oakley for Camby, which after a slight adjustment period, propelled the Knicks to return to the Finals in 1999 despite Ewing being a shell of his former self and largely unavailable due to injuries and age.</p>

<p>So to recap, Grunfeld was around from before the beginning of the ascension of the Riley Knicks, and then made two brilliant recoveries in mid-stream as the Knicks seemed to be fading from title contention in both the 1996 and 1998 offseasons. Maybe he didn&rsquo;t do well for other teams, but put some respect on this man&rsquo;s name, he is a fucking Knicks legend and is largely responsible for the entire 90s run, which is the only period of sustained excellence in franchise history aside from the 70s title teams.</p>

<p>Let me also clear up this misconception: Grunfeld is NOT the guy who fucked the Knicks&rsquo; salary cap for the entire decade of the 2000s. That was Scott Layden. Grunfeld signed a 25 year old Houston to his first Knicks contract in 1996, which was a reasonable <span class="math inline">\(56M over 7 years. In the 2001 offseason, the now 30 year old Houston opted out of the final 2 years of the contract and re-signed with a new \)</span>100M contract over 6 years. It was that second Houston contract which was the albatross, and it was Scott Layden who signed him to it. But that wasn&rsquo;t even the worst of it, as Layden oversaw the Ewing trade which inexplicably left the Knicks saddled with gigantic contracts tied to shitty or over the hill players (Glen Rice, Luc Longley, etc.), which he then traded for more gigantic contract / shitty player combos (Howard Eisley, Shandon Anderson) and compounded with shitty free agent signings (Clarence Weatherspoon). That absolutely fucked contract and roster situation was then perpetuated for years by Isiah Thomas. Scott Layden and Isiah Thomas are the ones you want to condemn, not Ernie Grunfeld.</p>

      <label for="llzbg1o" class="commentText"><p>Foye had come off a season of 16 PPG and had averaged 19 PPG in February and March. It was the best he had looked in his career to that point and given he was 25, there was thought he was going to continue improving (he didn&rsquo;t) and would have been a high functioning 6th man or starter in case Arenas got hurt (he wasn&rsquo;t either). Mike Miller was a good player who averaged 16+ in Memphis for two seasons but got super passive in Minnesota in 2009 and never really reverted back into a 3rd option type on offense after that.</p>

<p>The Wizards were able to jet some shitty contracts on Minnesota as we were fully going into tank command mode. Etan Thomas and Darius Songalia combined to make $12 mil bucks in &lsquo;10 and Songalia had extra years beyond that.</p>

<p>Washington got to make a salary dump, trade a first, and get back two players that would have worked (in theory) with Flip&rsquo;s offense pretty well. From Washington&rsquo;s perspective, I get why they made the move. It just didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

      <label for="llyvwxw" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, no one knew Steph and Harden will be superstars or stars.</p>

<p>In fact, early in their career, they were not. Though Harden was a 6th Man of the year level player. He was still 6th Man.</p>

<p>Steph was good, but not as great as we know today.</p>

<p>Maybe Wizards just don&rsquo;t see any of the prospects to be better than those assets.</p>

<p>You can apply that in this year&rsquo;s 2024 draft. 5th pick is Ron Holland. No one here will think Holland will be a superstar. But We never know, he might be in the future.</p>

<p>If Pistons traded their 5th pick for an asset, that will look fine. UNLESS, Holland became a Superstar.(Hypothetical, but yeah)</p>

<p>Nobody knew Steph would turn out to be Steph, but he definitely had people who were huge on him. He was seen as someone who had bust potential (due to his size and playing in a mid-major) but also had some of the highest star potential in that draft. Knicks fans (who were drafting at 8, one spot after Golden State) were frothing at the mouth at the prospect of potentially drafting him, to put into perspective what the kind of hype around Steph was like at the time.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re forgetting one very critical problem Curry had: He was injury prone as fuck. At one point the material in his ankles was kindly referred to as &ldquo;paper mache&rdquo;. This plagued the first half of his career. He could have easily been another Porzingis, but it turned out in a different way.</p>

<p>Obviously the scouts were wrong but he was ranked as 3rd best PG in the draft. Even 3 seasons into his career, there were questions of whether he could stay healthy. Hell there was an actual debate on whether the Warriors should keep him or stick with Monte Ellis. But you never know what can happen, Steph became a star and the rest is history!</p>

<p>It was 2008, not 1988. The revolution was well underway. There&rsquo;s obviously been a significant increase in 3 point shooting since Steph&rsquo;s stardom, but it was on the rise and post play was on life support by the time Steph got drafted.</p>

<p>Midrange attempts were down, 3 point attempts up steadily for years before Steph hit the league.</p>

      <label for="lm1sqsg" class="commentText"><p>Hot take, but the NBA is often ran by fools. You would think with millions on the line, they would be more meritocratic, but alas.</p>

<p>It was in the 88-89 season when shooting 3’s became as efficient as shootings 2’s. So it took the league 25 YEARS to realise long 2’s were terrible shots and shooting a lot more 3’s is more efficient.</p>

<p>If some person without the pedigree comes along and tries to explain that 3’s are 50% more points, you get better OR opportunities and reduce turnovers, the 5-10m/year player in the 2000s would laugh at your face and ask management to fire you.</p>

<p>For context, I played nationals in my country in the early 2010s before all the curry/3 point hype. Our state was historically terribly, but we were able to compete because we had a coach that was ahead of the curve and jacked up 3’s. He was laughed at by all the other coaches but looking at our team on paper, we had no business competing.</p>

      <label for="lm0ft4a" class="commentText"><p>Oh yeah you’re right. Steph was still great his last year in college, but they just didn’t have the same Cinderella run as the year before. I remember as the draft happened a case could at least be made for Rubio over Steph because he played well for a 17 year old in Beijing. I thought it was wrong, but it wasn’t a crazy choice, because the Wolves had the next pick. Taking Flynn was objectively stupid as it happened.</p>

      <label for="lm1zvib" class="commentText"><p>Flynn was a decent player but never thought of as having star potential, then his injuries after his rookie year killed off his career</p>

<p>Wolves taking him at #6 to basically be a stopgap until they figured out Rubio&rsquo;s buyout situation in Spain was incredibly short-sighted and stupid, take the best player available then trade him if you&rsquo;re really all-in on Rubio</p>

<p>They wasted a high lottery pick on a player they probably had little intention of keeping, David Kahn truly was one of the worst GMs in history</p>

<p>My understanding is that his agent was hoping to get Curry drafted 8th by the Knicks. He told the Warriors to not draft him (but that&rsquo;s largely because the Warriors had Crawford and Ellis).</p>

      <label for="llyycge" class="commentText"><p>A large part of it was Abe Pollin was dying and they wanted to squeeze one more playoff run out the Arenas/Jamison/Butler core even if all the evidence overwhelmingly suggested that they were DONE(!). Plus they had had success trading the 5th pick in the very recent past. They traded the 5th pick in the ‘04 draft that would be Devin Harris for Jamison, which kicked off this mini-renaissance for DC basketball (by Bullets/Wizards standards). And to circle back to the original point, Pollin was extremely loyal — to a fault at times — that if you did right by him, he would stick it out with you until the wheels fell off. Not a particular great in terms of winning at professional sports but it engendered a lot of good will within and around DC (and something that Leonsis tried to replicate but failed at because there’s literally no authenticity behind it).</p>

      <label for="llzjb26" class="commentText"><p>There was a <em>little</em> hype around Steph given his performance in the tournament that one year and his name, but not nearly as much as Rubio given how incredible he looked for Spain at what, 19?.</p>

<p>Flynn is the headscratcher, a pick that was only made because the Wolves had a gaping hole for a facilitating point guard even though they&rsquo;d just picked one because they knew he wouldn&rsquo;t come over for a while. The &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; around Steph was that he might not be able to do traditional point guard at all. Of course that was terrible decision making - basketball as a whole generally has a much better sense nowadays to just take the best player and worry about fit later but even then Flynn was a but of a reach</p>

      <label for="llzxarx" class="commentText"><p>People forget that Jonny Flynn was coming off a HUGE March showing, particularly in the Big East tournament. He was the first player to win Tournament MVP on a losing team since 1996, and had a showcase game for the ages when he put up 34 and 11 including 16-16 from the line in 67(!) minutes during an absurd 6-OT quarterfinal upset of a loaded UConn team. (Fun tidbit, Kemba Walker played 52 mins directly opposite Flynn and went 4-18 for 8 points)</p>

<p>I mentioned Kemba not just for narrative symmetry but because it seems like a fair comp. Undersized point guard coming off an epic March performance. If you squint your eyes a bit, I think there&rsquo;s a universe where things break differently and Flynn has something like Kemba&rsquo;s career. Hell, their rookie season per-36 numbers are virtually identical (actually Flynn has a reasonable edge in efficiency although that&rsquo;s not saying too much).</p>

<p>Somewhere in his second year, Jonny hurt his hip. I&rsquo;ve never been super clear on the exact sequence of events that followed but I believe he tried to play through it, made it worse, eventually got surgery, tried to come back too early and ended up re injuring himself again.</p>

<p>That off-season while he was still rehabbing, Rubio over from Spain&hellip; so Flynn got traded to a Rockets team that already had Kyle Lowry, Goran Dragic and Earl Boykins. He played like a hundred total minutes until the deadline where he was moved to Portland&hellip;where again he had a limited path to minutes behind Raymond Felton and Jamal Crawford. At some point he got hurt again, and just never got his lateral mobility back. At his size, that meant his career was over.</p>

<p>All this to say, yeah of course Flynn ended up being a bad pick, but I think history has been unkind to him for reasons outside his control. Obviously having the greatest shooter of all time taken immediately after you would make pretty much anyone who ISN&rsquo;T an all-timer seem like a schmuck, but it&rsquo;s not as though he was fundamentally unsuited to the league. Coin flips on the other side and maybe Jonny is the one with a couple All Star appearances and Kemba is the one who got injured early in a way that derailed his career as a sophomore.</p>

      <label for="llyxrjm" class="commentText"><p>The pick was too high, imo, for a couple of solid role players in Miller and Foye, but the Wizards were trying to add depth because they had playoff aspirations. They still had their same starting 5 that they had forever with Arenas, Stevenson, Butler, Jamison, and Haywood. Plus, adding Foye and Miller to the bench to go along with young prospects like Nick Young, Andray Blatche, and Javale McGee gave them good depth. Then the Arenas gun incident happened, and their entire team imploded, the whole starting 5 outside of Arenas were traded at the trade deadline, and they ended up finishing 19-63. They ended up getting John Wall with the first pick as a result of that tumultuous season, so it worked out in the end.</p>

<p>He was the #7 pick just a few years earlier and was on the rise, scoring 16 PPG the season before. He was elite in college and people thought he was just starting to blossom in the NBA.</p>

Like if he wanted to continue college his agent could tell any inquiring teams if they were on one of his lists that he&rsquo;d be OK dropping college for. Usually this only happens if they are really good players. it happens a lot more in baseball since they can get drafted out of high school, so the high school kids can say &ldquo;any team not named X,y, z will be declined and I&rsquo;m going to college&rdquo;. teams still draft them anyway, but usually with a lower round pick as a hail mary.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this trade the Wizards accomplish several important things. They pawn off several big salary players on the Twolves, which frees up money to put towards signing free agents this summer. This also alleviates the Wizards&rsquo; of several dead weight players.  Though Thomas is a force as a rebounder, the undersized center is injury prone and an offensive liability.  As for the foreign forwards, Songaila and Pecherov&rsquo;s shared shooting ability might have been what brought them to the Wizards but would&rsquo;ve unlikely been a focal point in Saunders&rsquo; offense. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In making this trade the Wizards are showing that they have faith that Javale McGee, their 18th pick in the 2008 draft, and veteran Brendan Haywood can competitively share minutes at center.  It also reiterates the front office&rsquo;s undying trust in the &ldquo;big three&rdquo; of Arenas, Butler and Jamison.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lm009hw" class="commentText"><p>A win now move by owner Abe Pollin who didn&rsquo;t have much time to live.   Wizards were shopping the pick no matter what-  the Blazers were unwilling to give up either Rudy Fernandez or Nicolas Batum.  The Wizards reportedly offered the pick for Manu but the Spurs declined.   The Knicks best chip they could offer was Wilson Chandler.</p>

<p>The Wizards also avoided the Luxury tax with this move.   Either way it was still a miserable one.  Even if the Wizards didn&rsquo;t want to take Curry, they could have taken a promising shooting guard like DeRozan (although  the Wizards did have Nick Young, DeRozan was younger as a freshman).</p>

<p>BTW, IIRC the Wizards would have taken Curry if they kept the pick according to Washington Post Insider Michael Lee.</p>

At the time wizards lost Gilbert to injuries for the last two seasons but still had a playoff talented roster. Foye had a good season showed improvement.  Mike miller was like injured even though he played 70ish games he only started like 40.  Miller was an above average starter during that trade.  Hindsight was <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> but it wasn’t that bad of a trade in the time.  Of course now you’d be like just draft curry but no one knew curry would be this good some even had Johnny Flynn and Brandon Jennings ranked over him pre draft.</p>

      <label for="llz2glq" class="commentText"><p>As others have mentioned, Steph was not guaranteed to become the Steph we know today. Just another in a long line of “player no one knew would be a HOF level player gets drafted behind career-long journeyman”. It happens all the time.</p>

<p>The Wizards thinking at the time was to run it back one more time with Arenas-Jamison-Butler, a core that had made the playoffs four straight years after only one trip in the previous 15. The Wizards struggled hard without Arenas in 08-09 due to injury.  They didn’t have time for a player to develop, and there were no guarantees that Ricky Rubio would come stateside immediately (and he spent the next two years in Spain). Foye was seen as someone who could allow Arenas to rest as a PG during games, Miller was steady and dependable, you knew exactly what he was going to give you.</p>

<p>It all went sideways when Arenas and Crittenton had their beef and brought guns to the office. Arenas was suspended for the year, the team couldn’t compete without him, and injuries piled up to truly kill the season.</p>

<p>So yes, in hindsight the Wizards look dumb for passing on Rubio or even Curry, but in the moment, they had some logic to the move.</p>

      <label for="lm6345z" class="commentText"><p>Sure. I agree almost no one thought he&rsquo;d be arguably the best player in the league. But it&rsquo;s still a miss by the Wolves considering Rubio and steph would have fit together beautifully.</p>

<p>And Steph&rsquo;s ankle issues didn&rsquo;t start until he was in the league&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t a problem at Davidson, so wouldn&rsquo;t have been a draft concern.</p>

      <label for="llz9mf7" class="commentText"><p>Wizards poorly evaluated their talent, particularly at the top and went into Win Now Mode.. Their thinking may have gone like this - Gilbert Arenas was coming back from injury and they still had Butler and Jamison. He only played 2 games the season before which was why they were terrible.  Valuable role players like Foye and Miller could be enough to take the next step. Any rookie available at 5 would not be that, in their minds.</p>

      <label for="llzaaay" class="commentText"><p>Funny as it sounds in hindsight, Wizards at the moment believed that they &ldquo;are one or two pieces away&rdquo;. That piece was supposed to be mainly a point guard to have Arenas focus on scoring and perimeter shooting at the time.</p>

<p>The idea was basically: we were 5th in the conference the previous season. Now we got lottery pick completely randomly because Arenas and Haywood were injured the whole season and that result doesn&rsquo;t count (and as we know from Reddit comments on everything - losing with injured players is basically like winning if you think about it), but this lottery pick is not in our &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; because we can add a few pieces and jump from being 5th in conference to contending now.</p>

<p>Also, 2009 draft was seen as not a very strong one, with some players with potential but little guarantee they will star in NBA.</p>

<p>Although today it&rsquo;s easy to laugh, that was the reasoning, and the general optimism is something you can see every season. &ldquo;Oh, team X was injured, but now they will be not, and also now they got a good coach, and they will surround player X with shooters, the player X will become much better when he has supporting cast and can focus on his stuff because that&rsquo;s how basketball teams work - now they will obviously be winning&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It can be described in the end as flipping Curry for Foye and Miller, but in terms of value, the pick was mostly the price Wizards paid to exchange deadweight contracts for someone playable. They were trying to keep the team from bottoming out by using the pick.</p>

<p>They felt Arenas, Butler and Jamison is too much &ldquo;talent&rdquo; to just let it sink.</p>

I believe the reports that Grunfeld was pressured/ordered to make a win-now move by Pollin, and can even believe this was probably about a good a move as they could have made. Just life for the Wizards…</p>

There were some really good point guards in this draft and the Wolves missed on just about all of them.  Rubio was a solid player, but to miss out on Steph and Jrue Holiday hurts.   Even some of the other guards (Jeff Teague, Ty Lawson, Darren Collison, Brandon Jennings) would of been better picks than Flynn and Rubio</p>

      <label for="lm1r56y" class="commentText"><p>Nba in 2009 had just came off two very big drafts in  the &ldquo;one and done&rdquo; Era. At the time, the draft was only seen as having Blake Griffin as the star. Rubio was a huge deal but obviously was a draft and stash. Curry was an obvious march madness darling, but everyone was concerned about his size as the nba wasn&rsquo;t in the shoot first pg era that we see now. Brandon Jennings was huge deal coming out of high school but skipped on Arizona to go play in Austrialia i believe?. Jennings draft stock took a hit. It wasn&rsquo;t seen as a loaded draft but still had some very intriguing prospects like Harden, Derozen and the ones I mentioned earlier. Thabeet was consensus number 2 pick so it wasn&rsquo;t all cocaine and unicorns.</p>

<p>Like everyone has said Wizards wanted to win now! Even though Jamison was in the twilight of his career, Butler was declining and Areans knees and mind were fucked up. Randy Foye was playing good and Mike Miller played well for the wizards in years prior. The dumbfuck gm, as my die hard wizards fan dad called him, thought he was keeping up with Celtics.</p>

<p>Hindsights <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> but a very very bad trade for an aging team looks even worse 20 years later as a colossal fuck up.</p>

      <label for="lm34sps" class="commentText"><p>At the time there were huge question marks about Steph and the world had just watched a 17 year old Ricky Rubio starting in the Olympics for Spain outplaying grown men the summer before.</p>

<p>In hindsight yeah they fucked up, but Rubio was easily considered the best PG in the draft. Him and Brandon Roy are my biggest What-if of the 2010s.</p>

      <label for="lm5ey9o" class="commentText"><p>Steph Curry was too small.  His shooting style wouldn’t be effective against bigger guards.  He wouldn’t be able to get to the rim and he was replacement level passer.</p>

<p>None of these things were right.  But those were the reasons.  Also, most people are drafting for the current league not the league 5 years into the future.</p>
