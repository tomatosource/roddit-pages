</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Each team is down to their final game of group play, and no team is technically eliminated (although Puerto Rico would need multiple miracles to get there). Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of what&rsquo;s at stake for the final games.</p>

<p>Quick reminder of the way the QF seeding will work. The top 2 from each group will advance, along with the two best 3rd-place teams. They will be grouped into four pots - D (top 2 1st-place teams), E (#3 1st place and #1 2nd place), F (Remaining 2nd place teams), and G (the two 3rd place teams that qualify).</p>

<p>The teams from D will be randomly paired with teams from G, and same with E and F, with the rule being that you cannot be paired with a team from your preliminary group. Got it?</p>

<p><strong>Group A</strong></p>

<p>Easy stuff first - Canada finishes 1st with a win, Greece is eliminated with a loss. 1) Canada 2) Australia 3) Spain 4) Greece</p>

<p>Now, where things get tricky for Canada is overall seeding. Right now, they&rsquo;d be the 3rd-ranked group winner, which means they would match up with a group runner-up and also have a <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> chance of being in the same half of the bracket as the US (assuming the US finishes as D1&hellip;which they will). Unless Canada really blows out Spain, they need France to beat Germany&hellip;and have France won by the same amount as Canada, or less. Otherwise, even if Canada wins their group, they could have a tough QF matchup and see the US in the semis, should they get there.</p>

<p>Now, here are the more complicated scenarios:</p>

<p>Spain and Australia win - Three-way tie for first, and we&rsquo;ll go to H2H point differential. Australia beat Spain by 12, and Canada beat Australia by 10, so right now the rankings are Canada +10, Australia +2, Spain -12. So, if Spain beats Canada by 15+ they finish 1st (Canada 3rd), if they win by 11-15 they finish 2nd (Canada 3rd), and if they win by 10 or less they finish 3rd (Canada 2nd if Spain wins by 9-10, Canada 1st if Spain wins by 8 or less). So for Australia to win the group, they need Spain to win by 9-15 points, no more and no less.</p>

<p>Spain wins, Greece wins - 1) Spain 2) Canada 3) Greece 4) Australia</p>

<p>Canada wins, Greece wins - Three-way tie for 2nd between Australia (+12), Spain (-5), and Greece (-7). So Greece would need to win by 3+ to advance, and Australia would be safe unless they lose by 18 or more. If Greece wins by 3-17 points, Spain is eliminated. Since the Greece/Australia game happens first, Spain will know before they play if they are at risk or not.</p>

<p><strong>Group B</strong></p>

<p>A much easier group to decipher, since we have two teams at 2-0 (Germany and France) and two at 0-2 (Brazil and Japan).</p>

<p>One of Brazil or Japan will finish at 1-2 and third in the group, so it will come down to rankings against third in the other groups. Right now, both Japan (-24) and Brazil (-25) are far back of Spain (-5) and South Sudan (-6), but the latter has to play Serbia in their final game. Also, we know one of Japan or Brazil will win, while South Sudan defeating Serbia would be a shocker.</p>

<p>Either way, whoever wins between Japan and Brazil will be looking to put up a big spread, and will likely need to wait until the Group C games on Saturday to know their fate. That said, if they pick up a win and finish with a better point differential than third in Group A, they&rsquo;ll clinch.</p>

<p>The battle for first is France vs. Germany. Germany (+33) is in the driver&rsquo;s seat for the D2 spot, which would mean playing a 3rd-place team (either South Sudan or 3rd in Group A, depending on who makes it), and avoiding the US until the finals. France (+16) is basically even with Canada (+17), and they will know before their game starts with their &ldquo;magic number&rdquo; is if they want that D2 spot.</p>

<p><strong>Group C</strong></p>

<p>The US has won their two games by a combined 43 points. Puerto Rico has lost their two games by a combined 52 points&hellip;and they played the two teams the US has defeated. The US is going to win and lock up D1, and Puerto Rico&hellip;well, they qualified for the first time since 2004, that&rsquo;s a win.</p>

<p>Serbia vs. South Sudan is a battle for second place, but the honest goal for South Sudan is &ldquo;Win&hellip;.but above all else, don&rsquo;t get blown out.&rdquo; They will also know their &ldquo;magic number&rdquo; before they play, and as long as their point differential is better than one of the other third place teams, they&rsquo;ll advance to the quarterfinals to play whoever finishes in the D2 spot. They sit at -6 right now, so they don&rsquo;t have a ton of room for error.</p>

<p>These two teams met in the 2023 World Cup, and Serbia won by 32. If that happens again, the Bright Stars&rsquo; run is done.</p>

<p>And just for fun, here are my personal predictions:</p>

<p>Pot D - US and Germany</p>

<p>Pot E - Canada and Serbia</p>

<p>Pot F - France and Australia</p>

<p>Pot G - Brazil and Spain</p>

<p>In that scenario, the guaranteed QF matchups would be US/Brazil, Germany/Spain, Canada/France, and Serbia/Australia, with US/Brazil and Germany/Spain being on opposite ends of the bracket, and a coin flip to decide where the other two quarters end up.</p>

<p>I hope you found this informative, but even if you didn&rsquo;t I had fun writing it. I love these types of tournaments, and should be great watching these scenarios play out.</p>

      <label for="lg1e8la" class="commentText"><p>Serbia won&rsquo;t do it. But as they play last game, they could lose on purpose and pick German path. That would also be fatal for one of Spain, Greece, Brazil or Japan.</p>

<p>where they could tank a game to get a better bracket, or win it out. (and then they almost won the 1 seed but then Devonte Graham happened)</p>
