<p>Also the only Laker to finish his career with 100FG% (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>). </p>

<p>Maybe a minimum viable product, just to see how much of the Jordan mystique was “imposing will”. Without anything but rose colored glasses, part of me just shrugs my shoulders and says “of course Jordan would find a way”</p>

<p>Like the “24 Olympic team would have Curry raining statistically superior threes on the Dream Team, but at halftime “Jordan would find a way” make it ugly, keep the game close, get it down to one possession and then with time running out, make a move, break an ankle, float in the air, and swoop the ball under or over Lebron’s outstretched arms and as the buzzer sounded the ball would go through the hoop.</p>

<p>Because he always did.</p>

<p>I still wonder what would have happened if Jordan had drafted Pau Gasol instead of Kwame.  This would give them interior scoring and shot blocking, opened up shots for Jordan and Rip Hamilton.  The east was so weak.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a stretch to say, Jordan, Gasol and Rip could have made it out the East over New Jersey.</p>

That&rsquo;s when Krause&rsquo;s rebuild went sideways.

      <label for="lhwliy9" class="commentText"><p>I’m asking why wouldn’t Lebron, Steph, and kd spam actions that involve Stockton, magic, bird, or Barkley as Jordan does his thing? How does the dream team counter that? Idk how fist fights help Barkley here, we’re talking about playing basketball and defense.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Unless they absolutely refuse to switch, which would be devastating for them with Steph coming off the screen. If they do switch and it’s Steph or kd on an island with Barkley, they would impose their will. Barkley isn’t good enough defensively to hold up in isolation against those two. If they choose to double, swing and find Lebron/kd attacking a close out, or book gets an open shot?</p>

      <label for="lhwp4ed" class="commentText"><p>It really depends on what rules they play with. In the 90s, defense was allowed to hold a lot more, screeners were allowed to move a lot less, and there were no landing space rules. Delly and FVV have shown that Steph can have a hard time with physicality. I&rsquo;ve even seen CP3 stop KD when he was allowed to be physical. I&rsquo;m not advocating for a return to 90s rules &ndash; I&rsquo;d like something between the 90s and today, with more defense allowed but not as much physicality &ndash; but if they played with 90s rules, the physicality would be a major challenge for Steph and KD.</p>

      <label for="lhxbx21" class="commentText"><p>If we’re talking about 2016 Steph or 2014 kd, maybe, but at this point in their careers, I don’t think the physicality argument holds for them anymore. Delly and FVV would get destroyed by this version of Steph. CP3 would get cooked by this version of kd. Also, if you rewatch that 2014 series, not only Paul was defending Durant, griffin and Crawford would help off their man to load up on the strong side, or straight up double kd on the catch. Idk if you can do that to kd when his teammates are Steph, Lebron, booker, and ad instead of Perkins, sefelosha, and Adams. These guys are too smart now to just say “physicality”. You need actual basketball reasons for why they would not exploit the obvious advantages they have on offense and defense over the dream team.</p>

<p>I do think the dream team’s biggest advantage, no pun intended, is their size. The op ignored that very real advantage in favor of his Jordan fantasy. The size and athleticism of Robinson, Ewing, and Malone would be a problem for the ‘24 team.</p>

<p>But it still applies to him, more than anyone else in NBA history (aside from lebron vs toronto lol).</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a fluke that he always had a feeling of inevitability&ndash; as in viewers and teams just absolutely KNEW he was going to win.</p>

<p>Watch this clip of his last 3 min as a bull. Scottie&rsquo;s back was hurting and he was no help.</p>

<p>8 points, TWO steals and game winner in 3 fucking minutes.</p>

<p>You can see the raw exertion even though exhaustion (he scored more than half his teams points that game).</p>

<p>ps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=530z-_yjdlU</p>

<p>Lol how many people could&rsquo;ve made something like those last 3 minutes happen? It wasn&rsquo;t even game 7.  That was just how he rolled, and that combination of grit and skill was a large part in what made him so extraordinary.</p>

<p>*edit<br>
And a big reason why he (AND his teammates) would often play better when it mattered (like playoffs) wasn&rsquo;t a fluke either.</p>

<p>It was well known that Bulls practices were often times MORE intense and played even harder than real games (because of  MJ).  So when the time came to play under the big lights they were all fine&ndash; nothing they haven&rsquo;t done before.</p>

      <label for="lhvpvz8" class="commentText"><p>I dont think he&rsquo;s perfect either, particularly in his early years.</p>

<p>And youre right, he didnt completely figure out optimal winning playing initially. He was a ball hog and didnt trust his teammates.</p>

<p>It wasnt until 89-91 that he DID figure the playoffs out. He finally completely committed to the triangle, the system which made him commit to trusting his teammates (this was admitted by him and spoken about by Phil, etc).</p>

<p>If you take a look at the numbers they took a big dive once he committed to the triangle because he involved his teammates more (although he was still scoring leader 6 more times LOL).</p>

<p>But once he figured that out he just couldn&rsquo;t lose anymore.</p>

<p>So yeah, he didn&rsquo;t have it initially in playoffs, but it&rsquo;s  also true that once he learned he consistently excelled and didn&rsquo;t lose.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s one big reason why I have him higher than LBJ.</p>

<p>LBJ is the one person i can easily was at least as talented than MJ, but there were moments in playoffs/finals where he didn&rsquo;t play with the same consistent effort as MJ.</p>

<p>I truly think LBJ could&rsquo;ve won more if he had the same consistent laser focus. Not everytime, but def more.</p>

Michael&rsquo;s Jordan&rsquo;s desire to win bit him in the ass as a GM, he even traded away Rip Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse to win now and that backfired. Nobody liked playing with Jordan, he came off as an old man who thought he was still the MVP when he should have been the veteran guiding new players to become stars. Kwame was a bust but whoever the Wizards picked in that draft was not gonna be good, because Jordan&rsquo;s whole roster and team culture was trash</p>

<p>dude he came back to play for the fucking Wizards.  He did not got out on top, their question is why he didn&rsquo;t go back to chicago when he came out of retirement again but instead went to Washington.  And the actual answer isn&rsquo;t what you said, it&rsquo;s because he was part owner of the Wizards and they sucked and he wanted to make them better</p>

      <label for="lhvz61z" class="commentText"><p>Jordan&rsquo;s mid-range game was perfectly fine before his first retirement, but the fact that it became his signature shot after he lost a step was absolutely insane.  No one could do anything about it.  Early in his career he won scoring titles with his athleticism.  Late in his career he won scoring titles with his primary weapon being a mid-range jumper.  He wasn&rsquo;t actively trying to win the scoring title and he still won it time and again.  Sometimes I wonder what his scoring averages would have been if he was actually selfish.</p>

      <label for="lhwms6j" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, exactly.  Second threepeat MJ wasn&rsquo;t as athletic as pre-first retirement MJ, but he was a total force of nature still because his midrange game was automatic.  When you need to grind out possessions and get tough baskets in the playoffs, everybody in the arena, everybody watching on tv knew Jordan was gonna make his shots.  And Wizards MJ here is all master of his craft, grit and guile, compared to any of his past selves.  Doesn&rsquo;t have the first step to blow by people, doesn&rsquo;t have the hangtime, still put up buckets, though.  Lower body strength is crazy.</p>

<p>Probably not much more. It&rsquo;s not like 30 years ago, people were saying it&rsquo;s a good idea to drink and gamble all night before games. But he still did plenty of that.</p>

<p>LeBron has always taken care of himself, and him taking advantage of all of the things modern science offers is just a natural extension of that. Jordan did stay in great shape, but he didn&rsquo;t take great care of himself even by the standards of what was available then.</p>

<p>Granted, he&rsquo;s partly a product of his environment back then, so maybe he would have acted differently today. But lack of available science wasn&rsquo;t the issue.</p>

      <label for="lhw1pl0" class="commentText"><p>I’m from that time though (in my 30s) it was WIDELY different. Maybe Jordan doesn’t care either way but - there’s a good chance he’s more focused in this era. Jordan started lifting midway through his career - in this era that would have started in high school. His whole understanding of his peak performance would have changed with sport science. Again he may not have cared but back then he was still dominating drinking and partying - he may have toned it down a bit more (even with social media as well)</p>

<p>But even with the partying - I think his recovering would have been heavily aided by modern science. I really wonder what approach he would have taken.</p>

      <label for="lhw2paw" class="commentText"><p>It was, but there were still guys who took care of themselves way better relative to what was available at the time. Admiral, Hakeem, and Malone come to mind. Reggie too.</p>

<p>He definitely would have done more today, but it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine him having even close to a LeBron or Steph level of commitment to taking care of his body. Honestly, the commitment to mental health today might have helped him more than anything, because getting his vices under control would still be his biggest impediment.</p>

      <label for="lhw4usa" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Jordan kind of being ahead of the curve with regards to focusing on weightlifting as a guard means he was already somewhat interested in an edge. I can&rsquo;t believe that wouldn&rsquo;t be amplified in this era.</p>

<p>Same way I think Kobe coming in a few years later probably believes in recovery a bit more and doesn&rsquo;t force his body through as much stress when hurt.</p>

      <label for="lhvr6hp" class="commentText"><p>I like deroz but he has one of the worst all time playoff resumes. His game just falls off a cliff. Doesnt help hes a ballstopper cuz when he plays the post you know hes gonna shoot it just like melo. dada lebron was spanking his and lowrys ass every post season. Id say butler is closer just in terms of mentality and craftiness. If you mix miami butler experience with chi butler shooting tho, thats mj right there.</p>

      <label for="lhvdhrf" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a really hard comparison to make because if you have 30% usage while shooting 70% of your shots from midrange on overall negative relative efficiency you&rsquo;re getting your playtime or shot opportunities cut.</p>

<p>Post Achilles tear Bryant is probably the best comparison if that fits your &ldquo;modern day&rdquo; requirement, though Jordan was better. Edit: After thinking about it more Post tear Bryant is probably too bad, while Pre tear Bryant is probably too good, but he&rsquo;s closer to pre tear Bryant.</p>

<p>Ignoring style but looking at overall value I&rsquo;d say probably current Chris Paul.</p>

Why doesn&rsquo;t he simply bulldoze his way to the hole and yell at the refs for not calling fouls?</p>

<p>Also, I didn&rsquo;t see him lose his dribble or throw am errant pass to the opposing team upwards of 6 times, let alone once!!! Who does this guy think he is, the GOAT?!?</p>

      <label for="lhvxae8" class="commentText"><p>This is on a team averaging not much more than 90ppg. Today&rsquo;s teams are putting up 30% more points than that on average. People compare a 25ppg player in today&rsquo;s league to MJ who went a good part of that season, before his injury at least, averaging the same amount. But there&rsquo;s a big differnence between averaging 25 on a team averaging 120 as opposed to a team averaging 90. One is <em>much</em> more impressive than the other.</p>

<p>But also consider&hellip;.this dude was retired for three years. You ever watched pro sport and they show a recently retired player in the stands? Dudes are almost always noticeably pudgier than you were used to seeing them in whatever sport they played. They no longer have to be in the gym for hours every day, in practice for hours every day, carefully watching the food they eat etc. They are out there enjoying life and doing whatever the hell they please. The life of a pro athlete is hard as hell, you need to be insanely disciplined day in and day out so when they finally get to retire they&rsquo;re having the greatest time of their life and enjoying every minute of not having to do all that crap. Jordan did that for <em>three years</em> and then came back to the NBA. But he also had bum knees even before the season started, having to get injections every other game and, to top it off, Ron Artest broke his ribs in a pick up game just before the season started. I&rsquo;m not sure you could concoct a worse scenario for a person to come back under.</p>

<p>All of those physical hurdles basically forced him to be a jump shooter. Yet despite all that it took him <em>just two freakin games</em> to have his first 30 point outing and nine games to have his first 40 point outing. Nearly 70% of his shot attempts were from mid range. Seventy percent! It&rsquo;s a big reason why his shooting percentages looked pretty bad, he could barely do anything else on the court because of those physical limitations. But after just ten games he was already averaging 27.4ppg, just 1.3ppg less than his last season as a Bull. People honestly don&rsquo;t appreciate how crazy that is.</p>

<p>Of course all of it eventually caught up with him and his production slipped to the point where, the game prior to these two, he had an abysmal 6 point game and his coach Doug Collins basically benched him early not knowing that it was going to break Jordan&rsquo;s then record streak of double digit scoring games. The media were all over it of course and wondering how MJ would react. Apparently Jordan spoke to Collins on the team bus and said to him &lsquo;you did the right thing taking me out&rsquo;. Next game he drops 51 and follows that up with 45. Less that two weeks later he again had back to back 40+ games.</p>
