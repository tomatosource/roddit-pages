<p>Norman Stanley Glick remains the <strong>first and only</strong> plumber to become an NBA player. Played for the Lakers <sup>1948</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> season. </p>

<p>Also the only Laker to finish his career with 100FG% (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>). </p>

<p>Also drafted to the MLB but due to NCAA rules I dont understand, he was not allowed to play.</p>

<p>Maybe a minimum viable product, just to see how much of the Jordan mystique was “imposing will”. Without anything but rose colored glasses, part of me just shrugs my shoulders and says “of course Jordan would find a way”</p>

<p>Like the “24 Olympic team would have Curry raining statistically superior threes on the Dream Team, but at halftime “Jordan would find a way” make it ugly, keep the game close, get it down to one possession and then with time running out, make a move, break an ankle, float in the air, and swoop the ball under or over Lebron’s outstretched arms and as the buzzer sounded the ball would go through the hoop.</p>

<p>Because he always did.</p>

<p>I still wonder what would have happened if Jordan had drafted Pau Gasol instead of Kwame.  This would give them interior scoring and shot blocking, opened up shots for Jordan and Rip Hamilton.  The east was so weak.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a stretch to say, Jordan, Gasol and Rip could have made it out the East over New Jersey.</p>

That&rsquo;s when Krause&rsquo;s rebuild went sideways.

I watched most of those games during the two years he came back (ESPN and TNT televised as many as they could) and the rest of the team mostly sucked. Outside of Rip Hamilton, Stackhouse, and Larry Hughes it was all dudes who would ideally be 10th and 11th men on other teams.</p>

How does the dream team counter that? Idk how fist fights help Barkley here, we’re talking about playing basketball and defense.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Unless they absolutely refuse to switch, which would be devastating for them with Steph coming off the screen. If they do switch and it’s Steph or kd on an island with Barkley, they would impose their will. Barkley isn’t good enough defensively to hold up in isolation against those two. If they choose to double, swing and find Lebron/kd attacking a close out, or book gets an open shot?</p>

      <label for="lhwp4ed" class="commentText"><p>It really depends on what rules they play with. In the 90s, defense was allowed to hold a lot more, screeners were allowed to move a lot less, and there were no landing space rules. Delly and FVV have shown that Steph can have a hard time with physicality. I&rsquo;ve even seen CP3 stop KD when he was allowed to be physical. I&rsquo;m not advocating for a return to 90s rules &ndash; I&rsquo;d like something between the 90s and today, with more defense allowed but not as much physicality &ndash; but if they played with 90s rules, the physicality would be a major challenge for Steph and KD.</p>

      <label for="lhxbx21" class="commentText"><p>If we’re talking about 2016 Steph or 2014 kd, maybe, but at this point in their careers, I don’t think the physicality argument holds for them anymore. Delly and FVV would get destroyed by this version of Steph. CP3 would get cooked by this version of kd. Also, if you rewatch that 2014 series, not only Paul was defending Durant, griffin and Crawford would help off their man to load up on the strong side, or straight up double kd on the catch. Idk if you can do that to kd when his teammates are Steph, Lebron, booker, and ad instead of Perkins, sefelosha, and Adams. These guys are too smart now to just say “physicality”. You need actual basketball reasons for why they would not exploit the obvious advantages they have on offense and defense over the dream team.</p>

<p>I do think the dream team’s biggest advantage, no pun intended, is their size. The op ignored that very real advantage in favor of his Jordan fantasy. The size and athleticism of Robinson, Ewing, and Malone would be a problem for the ‘24 team.</p>

<p>Had the Wizards ope&rsquo;d into the playoffs in &lsquo;02 they would have played the Nets (52-30). The Nets would likely have won but the East was probably at its absolute bottom as a conference in &lsquo;02 and &lsquo;03.</p>

<p>That said, the Wizards were pretty much Jordan and &ldquo;other scorer paired next to Jordan&rdquo; (whether it be Rip or Stack)</p>

      <label for="lhvz61z" class="commentText"><p>Jordan&rsquo;s mid-range game was perfectly fine before his first retirement, but the fact that it became his signature shot after he lost a step was absolutely insane.  No one could do anything about it.  Early in his career he won scoring titles with his athleticism.  Late in his career he won scoring titles with his primary weapon being a mid-range jumper.  He wasn&rsquo;t actively trying to win the scoring title and he still won it time and again.  Sometimes I wonder what his scoring averages would have been if he was actually selfish.</p>

      <label for="lhwms6j" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, exactly.  Second threepeat MJ wasn&rsquo;t as athletic as pre-first retirement MJ, but he was a total force of nature still because his midrange game was automatic.  When you need to grind out possessions and get tough baskets in the playoffs, everybody in the arena, everybody watching on tv knew Jordan was gonna make his shots.  And Wizards MJ here is all master of his craft, grit and guile, compared to any of his past selves.  Doesn&rsquo;t have the first step to blow by people, doesn&rsquo;t have the hangtime, still put up buckets, though.  Lower body strength is crazy.</p>

<p>dude he came back to play for the fucking Wizards.  He did not got out on top, their question is why he didn&rsquo;t go back to chicago when he came out of retirement again but instead went to Washington.  And the actual answer isn&rsquo;t what you said, it&rsquo;s because he was part owner of the Wizards and they sucked and he wanted to make them better</p>

<p>Probably not much more. It&rsquo;s not like 30 years ago, people were saying it&rsquo;s a good idea to drink and gamble all night before games. But he still did plenty of that.</p>

<p>LeBron has always taken care of himself, and him taking advantage of all of the things modern science offers is just a natural extension of that. Jordan did stay in great shape, but he didn&rsquo;t take great care of himself even by the standards of what was available then.</p>

<p>Granted, he&rsquo;s partly a product of his environment back then, so maybe he would have acted differently today. But lack of available science wasn&rsquo;t the issue.</p>

      <label for="lhw1pl0" class="commentText"><p>I’m from that time though (in my 30s) it was WIDELY different. Maybe Jordan doesn’t care either way but - there’s a good chance he’s more focused in this era. Jordan started lifting midway through his career - in this era that would have started in high school. His whole understanding of his peak performance would have changed with sport science. Again he may not have cared but back then he was still dominating drinking and partying - he may have toned it down a bit more (even with social media as well)</p>

<p>But even with the partying - I think his recovering would have been heavily aided by modern science. I really wonder what approach he would have taken.</p>

      <label for="lhw2paw" class="commentText"><p>It was, but there were still guys who took care of themselves way better relative to what was available at the time. Admiral, Hakeem, and Malone come to mind. Reggie too.</p>

<p>He definitely would have done more today, but it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine him having even close to a LeBron or Steph level of commitment to taking care of his body. Honestly, the commitment to mental health today might have helped him more than anything, because getting his vices under control would still be his biggest impediment.</p>

      <label for="lhw4usa" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Jordan kind of being ahead of the curve with regards to focusing on weightlifting as a guard means he was already somewhat interested in an edge. I can&rsquo;t believe that wouldn&rsquo;t be amplified in this era.</p>

<p>Same way I think Kobe coming in a few years later probably believes in recovery a bit more and doesn&rsquo;t force his body through as much stress when hurt.</p>

      <label for="lhx3eif" class="commentText"><p>Lebrons a wine mom and is always up late. Staying up late is part of the job. They don’t play games at 8am. They have to be at their best from 7pm to midnight as those are the times that nba games happen. Those are their prime hours. Nothing has changed with respect to that.</p>

      <label for="lhy6vrs" class="commentText"><p>I haven’t mentioned Lebron. We are literally talking about MJ, but okay; reveal yourself 😉</p>

<p>When I mean staying up late I’m talking about 6am on game night, not midnight. I guess smoking cigars is part of the job too?</p>

<p>All of the propaganda stories told about MJ smoking and parting and still dropping 50 were supposed to make him look legendary but they’ve come to bite his legacy in the ass now that common people/fans understand basic sports science. Now we all realize how much he left on the table by retiring (not taking enough car of his mental health (pre social media too, btw)) and exhausting himself.</p>

<p>He snitched on all his teammates for doing coke in hotel rooms, as a rookie, but wouldn’t listen to people telling him to stop smoking. Clown behaviour. If he was an average player with that hypocrisy people would fucking roast him</p>

      <label for="lhy89vy" class="commentText"><p>Are you gonna pretend like players today don’t smoke? KD is high as fuck in every interview. 80% of the league probably smokes weed. MJ wasn’t out partying til 6am. You made that completely up.</p>

<p>I bring up Lebron because he is the absolute staple of modern medicine and discipline and he is drinking wine on his social media regularly out in the open. No one cares. It completely negates your argument that the absolute most disciplined athlete today in the world also happens to drink alcohol regularly with no negative repercussions to his play. Modern day athletes are still allowed to drink alcohol. What you are saying is false.</p>

      <label for="lhy9fuh" class="commentText"><p>My apologies. I said that every fan understands modern sports science but clearly you don’t.</p>

<p>Find a doctor who says smoking weed (vaping is the most common method among athletes) is equivalent to smoking cigars and you win the argument 😂</p>

<p>Google “how many hours did MJ sleep each night” and tell me with a straight face that he was using the best Modern science to optimize his athletic abilities. Google the benefits of wine vs the benefits of cigars. I can’t believe I even have to type these things, what the fuck are we talking about?</p>

<p>And these are only the things we know because they are what MJ literally BRAGGED about. I’m sure staying out on the golf course to gamble was great for his longevity as well..</p>

<p>What’s your reasoning for why one of the best athletes of all time wasn’t able to have great longevity relative to his peak? I’ve given my reasoning, though it’s sort of common knowledge at this point.</p>

He didn’t do anything that different than athletes today. They work hard and then let off steam by having a drink or smoke sometimes, big fucking deal.</p>

<p>Since you’re not addressing any of my other points I’ll just do it for you</p>

<p>“But it appears even the greatest player of all time had no qualms about letting late night partying get in the way of his craft. So much so he spent the whole night prior to winning gold at the 1992 Olympic Games gambling and drinking before helping Team USA achieve their historic feat.”</p>

<p>If you read the article you will see that he drank and smoked until, oh my god, six in the morning</p>

<p>Thanks for playing</p>

      <label for="lhyb6zl" class="commentText"><p>One time, yes. Not regularly. NBA players today also went out in paris. The gold medal match in 92 was not like the gold medal match this week. It was basically an exhibition game. They stayed in the hotel room with all the players, didn’t go out and party, they stayed in and played cards. It was the offseason for them. You’re out here acting like modern day players are Mormon. Next up you’re going to tell me gambling is a sin.</p>

      <label for="lhvf86r" class="commentText"><p>Not quite because Mike was also one of the best defensive players in the league. Mj was also better than derozan offensively. About as close a comparison as you can find though. Mike was so much more intimidating too. You could tell he was always up for the fight.  Mike was the definition of a dogg.</p>

Doesnt help hes a ballstopper cuz when he plays the post you know hes gonna shoot it just like melo. dada lebron was spanking his and lowrys ass every post season. Id say butler is closer just in terms of mentality and craftiness. If you mix miami butler experience with chi butler shooting tho, thats mj right there.</p>

      <label for="lhvdhrf" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a really hard comparison to make because if you have 30% usage while shooting 70% of your shots from midrange on overall negative relative efficiency you&rsquo;re getting your playtime or shot opportunities cut.</p>

<p>Post Achilles tear Bryant is probably the best comparison if that fits your &ldquo;modern day&rdquo; requirement, though Jordan was better. Edit: After thinking about it more Post tear Bryant is probably too bad, while Pre tear Bryant is probably too good, but he&rsquo;s closer to pre tear Bryant.</p>

<p>Ignoring style but looking at overall value I&rsquo;d say probably current Chris Paul.</p>

      <label for="lhwt1k3" class="commentText"><p>It’s bc it’s one game. It happens to legends at old ages. So many nagging pains. It happens to Bron too, you could pull 2 games from last year or even 2 from the Olympics and one he’d look like his prime self and one he’d look older and slower.</p>

      <label for="lhvxae8" class="commentText"><p>This is on a team averaging not much more than 90ppg. Today&rsquo;s teams are putting up 30% more points than that on average. People compare a 25ppg player in today&rsquo;s league to MJ who went a good part of that season, before his injury at least, averaging the same amount. But there&rsquo;s a big differnence between averaging 25 on a team averaging 120 as opposed to a team averaging 90. One is <em>much</em> more impressive than the other.</p>

<p>But also consider&hellip;.this dude was retired for three years. You ever watched pro sport and they show a recently retired player in the stands? Dudes are almost always noticeably pudgier than you were used to seeing them in whatever sport they played. They no longer have to be in the gym for hours every day, in practice for hours every day, carefully watching the food they eat etc. They are out there enjoying life and doing whatever the hell they please. The life of a pro athlete is hard as hell, you need to be insanely disciplined day in and day out so when they finally get to retire they&rsquo;re having the greatest time of their life and enjoying every minute of not having to do all that crap. Jordan did that for <em>three years</em> and then came back to the NBA. But he also had bum knees even before the season started, having to get injections every other game and, to top it off, Ron Artest broke his ribs in a pick up game just before the season started. I&rsquo;m not sure you could concoct a worse scenario for a person to come back under.</p>

<p>All of those physical hurdles basically forced him to be a jump shooter. Yet despite all that it took him <em>just two freakin games</em> to have his first 30 point outing and nine games to have his first 40 point outing. Nearly 70% of his shot attempts were from mid range. Seventy percent! It&rsquo;s a big reason why his shooting percentages looked pretty bad, he could barely do anything else on the court because of those physical limitations. But after just ten games he was already averaging 27.4ppg, just 1.3ppg less than his last season as a Bull. People honestly don&rsquo;t appreciate how crazy that is.</p>

<p>Of course all of it eventually caught up with him and his production slipped to the point where, the game prior to these two, he had an abysmal 6 point game and his coach Doug Collins basically benched him early not knowing that it was going to break Jordan&rsquo;s then record streak of double digit scoring games. The media were all over it of course and wondering how MJ would react. Apparently Jordan spoke to Collins on the team bus and said to him &lsquo;you did the right thing taking me out&rsquo;. Next game he drops 51 and follows that up with 45. Less that two weeks later he again had back to back 40+ games.</p>
