      <label for="lczelf3" class="commentText"><p>Basically nobody wants to criticize wemby ever especially on this sub. People say all sorts of ridiculous shit like next year he’s gonna make a jump to top 10 or top 5 player. He’s guaranteed to be top 10 all time etc.</p>

<p>Wemby has a decent amount of flaws in his game he needs to fix both offensively and defensively. Most of these flaws have to do with him being a complete string bean. He gets bullied against any capable big man with post moves every single time. Offensively he jacks up way too many 3s and jump shots for a guy his size and it brings down his efficiency.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with him being skinny but he also is not a capable perimeter defender.</p>

<p>When you consider this it’s actually crazy ppl already wanna say he’s the best defender in the league and he’s projected to be better than Anthony Davis by next year lol.</p>

<p>Every single time? Thats crazy. Go YouTube wemby blocking Jokic. And any capable big man? This is a video of Jokic, one of the best post scorers of all time. Nobody can guard Jokic. Wemby does great against 95% of centers</p>

<p>&ldquo;he also is not a capable perimeter defender&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obviously you have not seen the 10 minute compilation of wemby blocking 3pt shots. Sure, he&rsquo;s not Jrue holiday but Wemby is absolutely a capable perimeter defender. </p>

<p>Wemby is a gamebreaking defender.  Maybe you feel like its been overstated but overstating his weaknesses is not better</p>

      <label for="lczrbm6" class="commentText"><p>To properly guard Jokic,  you need a very strong base.  Keep him off the favorite spots.   And it really helps to have a shot blocker lurking nearby for help D.</p>

<p>Plus the nuggets got some great screening plays by Gordon and others to help Jokic get great low position on the catch. That really fucks up the defender if he can&rsquo;t battle through in time.</p>

It’s fair to criticize him for this aspect of his game, but Jokic cooks anyone in the post. Especially AD. People project Wemby to be better soon due to his extraordinary work ethic and ridiculous physical traits. It’s no slight to AD it’s just how god damn special Wemby is at such a young age.</p>

Not every one fills out the way we expect them, and even then he has a higher center of gravity than Jokic, similar to Gobert. So Joker can just bully these guys out of the way with minimal effort. It is what it is. I don&rsquo;t see that changing. Wemby will learn to adapt eventually.</p>

      <label for="lczoce2" class="commentText"><p>Lol okay I just have to say this. People on here have short memories and selective about what they want to remember. I watched every Spurs game last season. There’s 100% things Wemby needs to work on. Yes he can be too reliant on his 3 point shot at times. Turns the ball over too much. And yeah he needs to get stronger. Despite all that I would still say he was one of the best players in the league, especially the second half of the season and a top 4 defender.</p>

<p>He averaged 26 12 and 5 the last 15 games he played and just generally had stretches of being dominant defensively and offensively. Okay so he’s not the best defender in the league… the 20 year old is the second or third best defender? That’s okay. There’s a handful of players that can genuinely really move Wemby like this. Jokic is one of them. It’s definitely a weakness right now. In terms of what you said about AD (and I love AD’s game) Jokic has his way with AD often.</p>

<p>I actually watch games and remember what goes on in them. When Jokic posts AD up he can get to wherever he wants at will. Maybe not as quick as with Wemby but pretending like AD can genuinely guard Jokic is strange. People on this sub have literally said this multiple times over the years while watching them play. There’s a reason why some people say AD should play the 4 instead of the 5, and yes AD is stronger than Wemby so what does that say about Jokic? Also, Wemby’s perimeter defense is fine for a 7’5 person lol, logically speaking a 6’11 player should be able to defend the perimeter better than him. I wouldn’t say he just “can’t” guard on the perimeter.</p>

<p>When he gets some decent team mates his efficiency will go up, but some parts of his game will likely never be fixed.</p>

      <label for="lczg3az" class="commentText"><p>Dude AD also gets destroyed in these same scenarios.</p>

<p>You do understand that Wemby is the only guy in the league to force Jokic to actually change the way he shoots due to his length.</p>

<p>We played the Spurs last year a few times and each time Wemby was an issue. Doesnt matter how much Jokic got on him, he was an issue for everyone else.</p>

<p>My best example to describe Wembys defense is to compare how Braun acted when Wemby was in front of him vs when Gobert was in front of him.</p>

<p>For Gobert, Braun just took the challenge and dunked on him. Meanwhile when Wemby was in front of him in a similar scenario, he actually turned around and passed the ball to a shooter.</p>

<p>That should tell you a lot about what sort of menace Wemby is on defense.</p>

<p>And even compared to AD, id still say Wemby is the superior defender due to that length and flexibility.</p>

<p>That said its also true that he is simoly too light, but that causes more issues on offense than defense for him tbh.</p>

      <label for="lczgm95" class="commentText"><p>Idk what Anthony Davis and what wemby you’re watching you’re watching but AD absolutely does not get bullied the way wemby gets bullied in the post. AD is way stronger, it’s much harder to move him with bumps. Wemby gives in immediately. On the perimeter, Anthony Davis is probably the best big man except maybe bam and a couple other guys. You’re using one example lol with Rudy gobert and wemby. It’s really this simple, who would u feel more confident defending a guard on the perimeter if you need one stop? Anthony Davis or victor wembanyama? Anyone who says victor is absolutely delusional as everything currently stands.</p>

<p>Pretty crazy to me ppl wanna say wemby is already a better defender than Anthony Davis. Like I don’t understand how u can say that with a straight face at all. And how u can say Davis gets destroyed in the exact same scenarios??? Are u crazy? Anthony Davis gets destroyed on the perimeter as a big man? It’s one of his main strengths lmaoo. AD gets bullied in the post? Nope. He hardly moves even against the best centers who are massive. Meanwhile wemby looks like a amateur when he has to go against someone like jokic or embiid in the post. He physically cannot do it.</p>

<p>The first clip in this video, jokic is out at NEAR the 3pt line and backs wemby down right next to the basket in 2 seconds lol. Find me one vid of Anthony Davis with that piss poor post defense. Find me just one clip where Anthony Davis gets backed down from the fucking 3pt line by another center.</p>

<p>I have yet to see someone do that to Wemby lol.</p>

<p>And yes AD gets destroyed in those scenarios too. Dude regularly gets destroyed by Jokic, Embid and Sabonis because he isnt that strong either.</p>

<p>He doesnt fly away like Wemby does, but he doesnt do any better because he still isnt strong enough to stop those guys 1v1.</p>

<p>I mean who are you watching him defend in the post to think he doesnt get bullied lol.</p>

<p>Against the best in the league, everyone gets bullied in the post.</p>

<p>I don’t think anyone can defend Jokic 1:1 tbh, although Wemby being a Jokic stopper has been greatly exaggerated. Feels like Jokic moved him like paper</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the bullying. Im talking about the blatant fully extended arm that&rsquo;s an offensive foul.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the stalking part</p>

<p>I made 10 comments regarding 2 plays, 1 of them being shown in this compilation, the other being an even more obvious offensive foul that was called a block in the 2nd half, but that has nothing to do with Jokic bullying Wemby.</p>

<p>You could have made a compilation of Jokic toying with Wemby in the post (nobody&rsquo;s claiming that&rsquo;s not what happened) without including the blatant pushoff that actually takes away from Jokic</p>

<p>And its a 40 minute game and most NBA players wont get gassed from that. The rare times Jokic is gassed is when multiple bigs take turns guarding him (like in the casse of the 2020 Lakers and the 2024 Timberwolves).</p>
