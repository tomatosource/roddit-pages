<p>For years we all KNEW he was playing the type of basketball that could not win at the highest level. And that his limitations were massive and overlooked. We also KNEW his game would age poorly and we understood why KD left.</p>

<p>Then we traded for him and most of the fans bought in and loved his garbage play, but big counting numbers.</p>

<p>It was weird.</p>

It was terrible basketball more often than not when Russ was playing. But also hilarious how he’d get the ball at the 3 and the whole crowd would scream not to shoot and he’d shoot and miss lol</p>

<p>He earned all the criticism of his terrible play, but the personal attacks were definitely overboard and just fucking ridiculous.</p>

      <label for="lja53dh" class="commentText"><p>To this day he’s the most amazing player i’ve ever seen live. I’ve seen em all. Steph, KD, Bron, Dame, Duncan, Parker and I could go on and on, but Russ… just the way he moves, it was like every step he took was the most athletic step i’ve ever seen. I’ve never been more enamored by a player in real life.</p>

<p>He was my favorite player to watch for years. I think this sub has overcorrected a bit, because he absolutely could have won a chip as a 1B with KD had they stuck together, but he did make boneheaded plays that almost make zero sense at all and like everyone else I ended up basically hating the guy but still, doesn’t take away from how good and electric he was.</p>

That stretch of ball, his efficiency was way up because he bought in and stopped shooting and just drove to the rim and dunked a lot. It was the most winning basketball I’ve seen him play in his career. Then the Covid break happened and when he came back for the playoffs he was complete ass.</p>

      <label for="lj9xmds" class="commentText"><p>I think in this situation it’s just a guy that’s out there trying. Similar to Allen Iverson. AI didn’t win any championships and despite making the finals once he never really won much in the postseason either. Both guys didn’t really play much winning basketball but when you watch them you can easily tell they are trying to do whatever they can whether it’s AI driving up on 3 bigs in the 2000s dead ball era or Russ hustling for offensive rebound after offensive rebound 46 minutes into the game. They just played with a ton of heart. Was it winning basketball? No. But it’s hard to hate on a guy that’s out there trying hard at least. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>being composed to the level its more conducive to winning</p>

<p>can be the next step in your evolution as a player. And that&rsquo;s always been the problem with Russ, an incredibly entertaining player from day 1, but he never really evolved and improved on his weaknesses.</p>

      <label for="ljagnnn" class="commentText"><p>I agree completely. He never addressed his weak spots and as his aged and his athleticism fades his weak spots pop even more now that his athleticism can’t really bail him out. It sucks because the guy is so talented and has the skill set to be a top 3-5 PG ever. But either coaching when he was fresh in the league didn’t try to help his way of playing or he was too headed to change. The fact that he’s still one of the probably 10-15 greatest pgs ever says how good he is. But one thing you can never take away from him is that the dude fought on the court 99% of the time and gave effort. I’ll always remember him by that. Besides being king of the triple double of course. </p>

<p>Pointing out legitimate question marks like if we can build an elite defense with Sengun long term or things like Jalen Green making the leap in halfcourt offense would get downvoted to oblivion.</p>

<p>And I am not talking about statements like &ldquo;Oh these guys suck, we can&rsquo;t build it&rdquo;. Those naturally get downvoted, but someone does point out question marks even if valid, it also gets downvoted.</p>

He wasn’t the reason they lost in 2012 he played well in the finals. He also wasn’t the sole reason they blew the 3-1 lead, KD choked as well. KD is a better player but he hasn’t done shit outside of the Warriors infrastructure either. Russ does have obvious limitations and has blown his fair share of playoff games/series (like many other great players) but to say he can’t win at the highest level is nuts. Russ gets talked about like he has Stephon Marbury’s playoff resume it’s wild.</p>

<p>Him and KD, contrary to what people here believe actually worked well together. KD said similar things to that on his burner as well.</p>

I just knew that somebody would step up, and I was even more certain that Westbrook was not going to stand out of the way and stop failing. I just knew they couldn&rsquo;t beat us with him.</p>

      <label for="lj9m1fi" class="commentText"><p>This is what his fans don’t understand. He used to be a good player but would fold when it mattered so in playoffs you’re just glad he’s on the other team being his usual inefficient, boneheaded and at times downright bad self. If I had to watch his shooting selection as a fan of his team I would basically kill myself. Or just stop watching which is what I’m predicting the Nugs fans will do this year despite some of them trying to convince me he’s better than Reggie Jackson. At best, he’s equal to him. Doesn’t matter how bad RJ was last year, RW will top it this one.</p>

<p>I love Russ but the dude is infuriating to watch. He doesn&rsquo;t pass when he needs to. He goes a 100% every time when he doesn&rsquo;t need to. He shoots when he can&rsquo;t shoot. He turns the ball over too many times.</p>

<p>If he can turn himself into a Rondo or a Jrue type of player. Just Defend and shoot at the bare minimum.</p>

<p>If you’re trading away Westbrook to keep Harden, it would’ve had to be in 2012. Four years before that 2016 collapse in the semi finals</p>

<p>Coach him. Would have been a championship team if they convinced Russ that he was not the #1 guy, and that it was KD&rsquo;s team. If he couldn&rsquo;t see and accept that, he should have been traded. Instead, they gave the keys to Westbrook.</p>

<p>I know you&rsquo;re referring to shooting distance and not Russ shooting <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>,  however the &ldquo;inefficient&rdquo; midrange is 16 - 22 ft; not 17 -25 ft. Anything beyond 22 ft is classified as a 3pt shot and is technically a more valuable/efficient shot than the midrange.</p>

<p>Also, if we&rsquo;re just focusing on Russ, anything beyond 3 ft has been an inefficient shot for almost the entirety of his career lol</p>

<p>Rubio got a couple more steals and had a pretty solid game. I really wonder about his career if he had not tore his ACL in his rookie season, that had a lasting impact on his development.</p>

<p>I remember one time a reporter asked him about Curry back in the day and he had a smirk like &ldquo;that dude isn&rsquo;t on my level&rdquo; or &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not a threat&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And then the Warriors dynasty begun.</p>

      <label for="ljaexpn" class="commentText"><p>The sub is a bunch of revisionist sobs.  He was a great player that everyone knew would age in out fast.</p>

<p>OKC collapse was due to Westbrook, KD, and Harden deciding to shrink at the biggest stage yet Westbrook took all the blame.</p>

<p>KD (yeah free rings with Steph dont count) and Harden haven’t win shit and don’t receive any kind of hate from the fans.</p>
