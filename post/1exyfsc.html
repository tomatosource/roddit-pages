<p>For years we all KNEW he was playing the type of basketball that could not win at the highest level. And that his limitations were massive and overlooked. We also KNEW his game would age poorly and we understood why KD left.</p>

<p>Then we traded for him and most of the fans bought in and loved his garbage play, but big counting numbers.</p>

<p>It was weird.</p>

It was terrible basketball more often than not when Russ was playing. But also hilarious how he’d get the ball at the 3 and the whole crowd would scream not to shoot and he’d shoot and miss lol</p>

<p>He earned all the criticism of his terrible play, but the personal attacks were definitely overboard and just fucking ridiculous.</p>

      <label for="lja53dh" class="commentText"><p>To this day he’s the most amazing player i’ve ever seen live. I’ve seen em all. Steph, KD, Bron, Dame, Duncan, Parker and I could go on and on, but Russ… just the way he moves, it was like every step he took was the most athletic step i’ve ever seen. I’ve never been more enamored by a player in real life.</p>

<p>He was my favorite player to watch for years. I think this sub has overcorrected a bit, because he absolutely could have won a chip as a 1B with KD had they stuck together, but he did make boneheaded plays that almost make zero sense at all and like everyone else I ended up basically hating the guy but still, doesn’t take away from how good and electric he was.</p>

That stretch of ball, his efficiency was way up because he bought in and stopped shooting and just drove to the rim and dunked a lot. It was the most winning basketball I’ve seen him play in his career. Then the Covid break happened and when he came back for the playoffs he was complete ass.</p>

AI didn’t win any championships and despite making the finals once he never really won much in the postseason either. Both guys didn’t really play much winning basketball but when you watch them you can easily tell they are trying to do whatever they can whether it’s AI driving up on 3 bigs in the 2000s dead ball era or Russ hustling for offensive rebound after offensive rebound 46 minutes into the game. They just played with a ton of heart. Was it winning basketball? No. But it’s hard to hate on a guy that’s out there trying hard at least. </p>

<p>can be the next step in your evolution as a player. And that&rsquo;s always been the problem with Russ, an incredibly entertaining player from day 1, but he never really evolved and improved on his weaknesses.</p>

      <label for="lj9tkna" class="commentText"><p>Westbrook was the 2nd option on a team that made the finals and has played in 4 conference finals. This is a bad take. He wasn’t the reason they lost in 2012 he played well in the finals. He also wasn’t the sole reason they blew the 3-1 lead, KD choked as well. KD is a better player but he hasn’t done shit outside of the Warriors infrastructure either. Russ does have obvious limitations and has blown his fair share of playoff games/series (like many other great players) but to say he can’t win at the highest level is nuts. Russ gets talked about like he has Stephon Marbury’s playoff resume it’s wild.</p>

<p>He also wasn’t the sole reason they blew the 3-1 lead, but he was hugely responsible. KD standing in the corner while Russ didn’t pass to him or involve him in the game was one of the most frustrating things I have ever seen in a basketball game.</p>

His weakness has always been putting the ball on the floor around active hands. Also what a take, Russ only excelled because of Kd and I guess it wasn’t the combined talent of Russ, kd, serge and harden with some key role play from Thabo and fisher</p>

      <label for="lj9m1fi" class="commentText"><p>This is what his fans don’t understand. He used to be a good player but would fold when it mattered so in playoffs you’re just glad he’s on the other team being his usual inefficient, boneheaded and at times downright bad self. If I had to watch his shooting selection as a fan of his team I would basically kill myself. Or just stop watching which is what I’m predicting the Nugs fans will do this year despite some of them trying to convince me he’s better than Reggie Jackson. At best, he’s equal to him. Doesn’t matter how bad RJ was last year, RW will top it this one.</p>

<p>If he can turn himself into a Rondo or a Jrue type of player. Just Defend and shoot at the bare minimum.</p>

      <label for="lja3w4h" class="commentText"><p>Westbrook was more valuable at that time (2012), so idk if Morey would’ve been willing to give up more for Westbrook. Also Morey has a certain way he likes to build the team and I don’t think Westbrook fits that mold.</p>

<p>If you’re trading away Westbrook to keep Harden, it would’ve had to be in 2012. Four years before that 2016 collapse in the semi finals</p>

<p>Coach him. Would have been a championship team if they convinced Russ that he was not the #1 guy, and that it was KD&rsquo;s team. If he couldn&rsquo;t see and accept that, he should have been traded. Instead, they gave the keys to Westbrook.</p>

<p> inefficient 17-25</p>

<p>I know you&rsquo;re referring to shooting distance and not Russ shooting <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>,  however the &ldquo;inefficient&rdquo; midrange is 16 - 22 ft; not 17 -25 ft. Anything beyond 22 ft is classified as a 3pt shot and is technically a more valuable/efficient shot than the midrange.</p>

<p>Also, if we&rsquo;re just focusing on Russ, anything beyond 3 ft has been an inefficient shot for almost the entirety of his career lol</p>

<p>Rubio got a couple more steals and had a pretty solid game. I really wonder about his career if he had not tore his ACL in his rookie season, that had a lasting impact on his development.</p>

      <label for="lj9i1cg" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think he has awful basketball iq either tbh.  I don’t think his assist numbers come to a guy with below average BBIQ.  I genuinely think the downfall of Russ was thinking he was the 1st option for a team with a chance to win it all.  Prime Russ taking less shots and playing some defense would’ve been an incredible player.</p>

      <label for="lj9rk0i" class="commentText"><p>True but that Wizards team was 17-32 (13th place) in April. That was when Russ went on an absolute tear and carried them into the play-in and then into the playoffs. His first half stats from that season were pretty bad if I remember correctly. And yes they had a losing record, but it was 34-38 vs. the 25-47 they were on pace for</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d do well in most industries by having strong work ethic and giving it your all which we know that Westbrook can do.</p>

<p>Most of Westbrook&rsquo;s weakness comes from basketball being a team game and him trying to do too much.</p>
