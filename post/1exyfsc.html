<p>For years we all KNEW he was playing the type of basketball that could not win at the highest level. And that his limitations were massive and overlooked. We also KNEW his game would age poorly and we understood why KD left.</p>

<p>Then we traded for him and most of the fans bought in and loved his garbage play, but big counting numbers.</p>

<p>It was weird.</p>

It was terrible basketball more often than not when Russ was playing. But also hilarious how he’d get the ball at the 3 and the whole crowd would scream not to shoot and he’d shoot and miss lol</p>

AI didn’t win any championships and despite making the finals once he never really won much in the postseason either. Both guys didn’t really play much winning basketball but when you watch them you can easily tell they are trying to do whatever they can whether it’s AI driving up on 3 bigs in the 2000s dead ball era or Russ hustling for offensive rebound after offensive rebound 46 minutes into the game. They just played with a ton of heart. Was it winning basketball? No. But it’s hard to hate on a guy that’s out there trying hard at least. </p>

That stretch of ball, his efficiency was way up because he bought in and stopped shooting and just drove to the rim and dunked a lot. It was the most winning basketball I’ve seen him play in his career. Then the Covid break happened and when he came back for the playoffs he was complete ass.</p>

      <label for="lj9tkna" class="commentText"><p>Westbrook was the 2nd option on a team that made the finals and has played in 4 conference finals. This is a bad take. He wasn’t the reason they lost in 2012 he played well in the finals. He also wasn’t the sole reason they blew the 3-1 lead, KD choked as well. KD is a better player but he hasn’t done shit outside of the Warriors infrastructure either. Russ does have obvious limitations and has blown his fair share of playoff games/series (like many other great players) but to say he can’t win at the highest level is nuts. Russ gets talked about like he has Stephon Marbury’s playoff resume it’s wild.</p>

      <label for="lj9m1fi" class="commentText"><p>This is what his fans don’t understand. He used to be a good player but would fold when it mattered so in playoffs you’re just glad he’s on the other team being his usual inefficient, boneheaded and at times downright bad self. If I had to watch his shooting selection as a fan of his team I would basically kill myself. Or just stop watching which is what I’m predicting the Nugs fans will do this year despite some of them trying to convince me he’s better than Reggie Jackson. At best, he’s equal to him. Doesn’t matter how bad RJ was last year, RB will top it this one.</p>

<p>I know you&rsquo;re referring to shooting distance and not Russ shooting <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>,  however the &ldquo;inefficient&rdquo; midrange is 16 - 22 ft; not 17 -25 ft. Anything beyond 22 ft is classified as a 3pt shot and is technically a more valuable/efficient shot than the midrange.</p>

<p>Also, if we&rsquo;re just focusing on Russ, anything beyond 3 ft has been an inefficient shot for almost the entirety of his career lol</p>

<p>Rubio got a couple more steals and had a pretty solid game. I really wonder about his career if he had not tore his ACL in his rookie season, that had a lasting impact on his development.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d do well in most industries by having strong work ethic and giving it your all which we know that Westbrook can do.</p>
