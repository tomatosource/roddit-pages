      <label for="lstytz9" class="commentText"><p>Nothing is guaranteed either way.</p>

<p>Nets fans felt the same way after the Harden Trade then 2-3yrs later the Rockets have the 3rd overall pick because the Nets 1st jumped from 9th to 3rd via Lottery.</p>

<p>KAT, OG, and Robinson are all super injury prone.</p>

<p>Mikal has the “Iron Man” status but that’s not guaranteed to hold up forever especially with all those cumulative minutes throughout his career.</p>

<p>If Hart and/or Brunson slide back just a little and regress towards the mean then that is a massive problem since now the Knicks depth isn’t what it used to be and they have no Draft Capital outside of a Protected Hornets 1st.</p>

Like yeah no shit that is possible but that is literally always true. Idk if KAT and mikal are like THE pieces but they make sense w what the Knicks were building, their timeline, and fit with the star they have so they went for it. Fine by me. People obsess over the 5 picks for mikal but they gave up zero player capital in the trade, then they got KAT without using anything but a single garbage protected pick.</p>

      <label for="lsue4rz" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;people obsess over the 5 picks&rdquo; Yeah bc in NBA history trades that&rsquo;s a pretty steep price to pay for a role player. In addition NBA competitive windows are a lot smaller than people assume. Everyone keeps saying &ldquo;oh those picks wont be worth anything&rdquo; . But projecting that guys who are 28 yrs old will still be good enough in 5-7 yrs from now is risky in itself</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen years of Karl Anthony Towns trying to be the best player on a team that ultimately ends up in the lottery, and that&rsquo;s not going to get better with him missing more games than Porzingis over the past half decade.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what 7-year plan you&rsquo;re looking at but even in their best case NY is really only looking to make a push over the next season or two. These sorts of setbacks could really screw them over.</p>

<p>They really need Bridges to work out in the short term.</p>

<p>Brooklyn has the Knicks&rsquo; picks all the way to 2031.</p>

      <label for="lsucjwj" class="commentText"><p>I don’t really get the point of any of these conversations. Sure some small guards fade. Plenty of others don’t. My take on it is that Brunson doesn’t really rely on athleticism to do his shit, so I think he may be in the latter group but who knows. KAT doesn’t need to the the best player on the team, he’s a #2 - last team he did that on made the WCF. I don’t really know what’s going to happen and neither to you - like yeah if Mikal Bridges is suddenly just a bad player then the Knicks are gonna be in a less good place but there is no actual reason to think that is happening. God knows if they’re gonna be contenders but without control of many of their picks they’re certainly going to try to be at least good and I imagine they won’t be tanking anytime soon.</p>

<p>Regardless this is all stupid as hell, this conversation is beginning from a wild overreaction to 4 preseason games combined with the basic r/nba belief that all trades where teams cash in picks for players with any flaws whatsoever are bad because there is risk involved</p>

He shot 38% for the full year on 8 attempts per game, which was significantly better than the previous two years. It was not a progressive drop off - he shot 40% from 3 over the last quarter of the season before shooting 30% in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Are you saying he got “jacked” in the week between the end of the regular season and the playoffs? What exactly is the theory here?</p>

Like closer to Ronnie Coleman and Schwarzenegger than Wemby. Tatum is way closer to Wemby as are all non-Zion players, maybe Lebron included.</p>

<p>Gonna say the douchey line about redditors being nerds sorry: I don’t think most of you lift weights or shoot a basketball more than once in a blue moon… Weightlifting will mess up your shot badly within like an hour or 2 of a good upper body workout, that’s it.</p>

      <label for="lste3w2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. If anything, what will mess up your shooting is training your lower body - I say this as a beach volleyballer who lifts a lot, and has a couple diplomas around sport and exercise. You don&rsquo;t just &lsquo;lose touch&rsquo; if you&rsquo;re actually training, or at least just mucking around playing with a ball every day. Having a stronger base or a slightly higher rise can cause some timing and judgement issues but these guys are of course practicing shooting all the time too, so it&rsquo;s whatever.</p>

If putting on muscle had an impact on shooting, NBA players wouldn&rsquo;t get on weight gain plans or lift weights. Every &lsquo;example&rsquo; people go to are players that were already bad shooters (e.g. Giannis).</p>

<p>You just need to look at any rookie who is still a good shooter later in their career to see its nonsense. Steph Curry is noticeably bigger than even his MVP seasons and yet still unstoppable. Why would he risk his entire game to put on some weight?</p>

      <label for="lstdkku" class="commentText"><p>What? This take kind of makes sense for a casual who shoots hoops once every 6 months (even then, it doesn&rsquo;t take long to adjust), but not professional athletes. Getting stronger is a gradual thing, and these professional basketball players will be constantly shooting the ball and adjusting their shot accordingly, while increasing their strength.</p>

      <label for="lstk9lu" class="commentText"><p>There are players who take a long break from shooting especially during the summer. AD for example <a href="https://x.com/hejtweeter/status/1535770860924989440?t=skl67XRII1cseYd1fD4l3Q" target="_blank">https://x.com/hejtweeter/status/1535770860924989440?t=skl67XRII1cseYd1fD4l3Q</a> That&rsquo;s 3 months off based on the timestamp of the tweet.</p>

<p>In addition, there may be other reasons, e.g. injuries. You can do weight training for your upper body if you have a leg injury, but you can&rsquo;t shoot.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take long to adjust, sure. But it might be anywhere from a couple of minutes to a number of days depending on the person.</p>

      <label for="lstwwyc" class="commentText"><p>Even if it were true that getting huge pecs affected shooting&ndash;these guys are very tall and rangy AND are not beginner lifters as they&rsquo;ve been involved in strength and conditioning programs for years, so it would take them a really, really, really, long time to get there. And are they going to train chest exclusively? If you trained enough to get huge pecs at 6&rsquo;8&rdquo;, you would gain so much weight that it would fuck up your overall game.</p>

<p>Think about it&ndash;Bridges and Lebron are basically the same height. Lebron is jacked by NBA standards and he doesn&rsquo;t have the hypothetical huge, bulbous pecs that would affect his shot. He would have to get significantly bigger than the 230-240 he&rsquo;s at now. Now do Bridges. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

<p>Also, just because&mdash;one of the most jacked dudes in the NBA is Desmond Bane&ndash;he appears to be barrel chested, short armed and probably could be super jacked if he wanted to be&ndash;42% from 3 for his career on good volume.</p>

<p>He shot 42% in 2021 before changing his form, yes.
He had a bad shooting night, yes.
He also shot 36% in 2020 and 33% in 2019.. which seems like an important detail
He has been VERY consistently between 37-39% for the last 3 years&hellip;another important detail.</p>

<p>Im not a betting man, but id bet gooooood money that this man aint all of a suddent gonna start shootin under <sup>35</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub>%. And if i had to guess? 37-39% on the season&hellip;</p>

Brunson, Deuce, Mikal, OG, and KAT are all good 3pt shooters, so I don&rsquo;t think they need to worry about a ton. Those five, with Hart in for Deuce sometimes, is probably their closing lineup, which is a good 5 out lineup.</p>

His 3P% weighed down because his off the dribble attempts increased. That’s not really his game. 38% when you’re taking 5+ catch and shoot 3s a game is elite. It wasn’t broken</p>

Do they think jumping slightly less on 7-8 3 point attempts per game is making the difference?</p>

<p>If this change hurts his shooting significantly, whatever trainer suggested it should be fired.</p>

      <label for="lstpmxy" class="commentText"><p>You want to release when going up because you have upward velocity from the jump and then your shot release can be more horizontal force compared to shooting at your apex when you’ll be landing and then will have to put upward force on your shot release and likely it will be a moonball and unless you’re crazy strong (like Jokic or LeBron but Jokic does moonballs while releasing on the way up and Bron shoots it fairly flat), there’s a higher chance of air balling. If you do medicine ball throws, try throwing it when you’re at the peak of your jump or midair compared to when you’ve bent your knees and loaded force on your quads. It’s much easier the 2nd way.</p>

<p>But mainly when you look at the best shooters like Steph, Ray, etc, a lot of their force from the shot comes from their legs and you have more upward force during the rise than at the apex. The only time you shoot at the apex is for contested midranges and only then MJ could do it because he was able to pause in midair.</p>

<p>Edit: looking at the vid, another thing is that Mikal jumps pretty high up which isn’t the best for longer distance 3s. You want to jump further horizontally since then when looking at the physics, it lets you generate more horizontal velocity on the ball than vertical and prevents the airballs. That’s why you see LeBron, Steph, Luka, and Dame load up but not jump that high and instead use that jump force to propel their shots.</p>

      <label for="lstyw9z" class="commentText"><p>Yes, but there is more than that.  Westbrook extends his arm up, and pulls it back so it looks like he is releasing higher than he is, so instead of extending at an angle out and up towards the basket, he kind of pulls it back after he releases it to be more vertical.  On top of that, he seems to have ball control issues because he loses control of the ball on layups and passes, now.</p>

It looks odd because his release point is on top of the middle of his head instead of on top of his forehead. But I think the follow through which helps guide the momentum has a similar trajectory, just starts at a different position.</p>

then shooting from over the head, i was taught you need to aline with your eyes.
i am no shooting coach but visually / amateurishly this looks like a terrible idea.</p>

<p>and if you look at the best shooters, how they get to the 90 degree angle might be different, but they all get their elbow to 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Curry is closer to a 30° angle, and quite a few other great shooters don&rsquo;t have this 90° angle either. It really depends on the shooter.</p>

Before it was like right above the forehead, now its way back towards the middle of his head! Release was always high and kinda janky but now he is just straight flinging it from behind his head like an OG at the park with no knees</p>

<p>Edit: wow and in 20-21 it was completely out in front of his face, never above the head. Wtf is going on, theres no way any coach would say to load the ball behind your head with a hitch and chuck it</p>

Then Steph came along and became the best shooter of all time by doing basically the complete opposite of this. His shot still looks “ugly” to me but who cares. But some people still think you’re supposed to release it as high as possible. Ironically Bridges is not even pulling this off and just looks awkward while doing it.</p>

      <label for="lsue4f4" class="commentText"><p>Cos of MJ. It worked for him cos he was mainly a contested pullup jump shooter. Kobe did the same. Someone like Ant is shooting the same. Steph sacrificed the height in exchange for a very quick release. Incidentally, it is a much easier shot to master too, leading to the 3pt era today. Dame, Harden, and newer guys like Trae Young or Garland all have similar low jump, quick release</p>

      <label for="lstas2c" class="commentText"><p>That’s not really how it works. If you keep repeating the same flawed technique, you’ll get less than optimal results. Almost everyone in the NBA can drain 3s in practice, but it doesn’t translate to real time performance.</p>

<p>When it comes down to clutch moments and your shot isn’t fundamentally sound, you’ll lack confidence to shoot, and your chances of missing goes way up.</p>

<p>That’s why Curry is the goat shooter. He shoots on the way up so he has a super quick release, has a low set point/shot pocket, has an open stance(feet turned, not squared up), and a super relaxed wrist(notice it just flops forward on every shot)</p>

      <label for="lsu9wuw" class="commentText"><p>Jonathan Macro from Knicks Film School helped talk me off a ledge about Mikal’s new shot adjustment. He basically talked about how Mikal is a professional and he trusts him to make the adjustment successfully. He compares the situation to Tiger Woods who, had the peak of his powers, decided to change his stroke and everyone question why. Sure enough, after an adjustment period Tiger was just fine. So his point was that there will be an adjustment period but in the end it’ll likely be fine.</p>
