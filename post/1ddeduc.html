<p>But if he’s your 3rd best player, your team is just not very good. Any coach that joins this team will have the most unrealistic expectations of all time and will be fired in 2 years. Hurley was right to not accept this job. Redick if he had any sense would do the same</p>

<p>Guess Denver won a chip in a weak west (first time I’m hearing that) but look who’s in the finals this year (5th seed). Doesn’t sound like the west is so locked down that a team with the Lakers recent success is hopeless.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give you that they matched up pretty well against OKC but aside from that I don&rsquo;t see how they really stood out as being better than their record</p>

<p>I keep seeing this &ldquo;Lakers are better than everyone but Denver&rdquo; take but there&rsquo;s not much from the past season to actually back this up</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re largely struggled against Dallas over the past few seasons as well so I don&rsquo;t think that would have been fun for them either</p>

      <label for="l84g7l0" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say they were miles better than their record, but the West this year was extremely tight, they matched up reasonably well against OKC and AD+LeBron is an elite duo for a playoff setting.</p>

<p>They have their share of issues as well, but I don&rsquo;t think Dallas is that much clear of them, for instance. Their trajectory this year was actually very similar to last year&rsquo;s Lakers, and I don&rsquo;t think the Lakers are that much worse than last year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d put current Dallas and the Wolves ahead of them, still. But if the Lakers got the 8th seed their possible path would be OKC, Dallas and Wolves. While very unlikely to win it all, I&rsquo;d say they were more likely to win each of those series than vs Denver. And they match relatively well vs the Celtics too, while then the global talent difference on players 3-6 would probably prove to be too large</p>

<p>If &ldquo;well they <em>might</em> have won 3 different series they&rsquo;d need to all win to get to the Finals&rdquo; makes you a contender there are like 15 contending teams</p>

<p>Again I don&rsquo;t see how the Lakers are special in this regard</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re one of many okay but not great teams</p>

      <label for="l84jwfm" class="commentText"><p>Not really. Most teams have two or more matchups where they are extremely unlikely to win.</p>

<p>But it does apply to quite a few teams in the West, yes. There&rsquo;s a reason why the 5th seed made the finals. The Clippers if healthy could&rsquo;ve won that series and both others. And I&rsquo;d give the Lakers a ~40% chance of beating Minny or Dallas. As I said, they wouldn&rsquo;t be favored, but they&rsquo;re way more likely to win that than Sacramento, NOP or the current Warriors.</p>

<p>Phoenix is the one team I was let down by, they&rsquo;ve done very well vs a gauntlet of tough teams to end the season but struggled mightily vs Minnesota. Their good regular season matchup did have a ton of noise due to open/wide open 3PT%, but I still didn&rsquo;t expect them to be dismantled in the way they were.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s plausible something like that would&rsquo;ve happened to the Lakers, but I think they&rsquo;re a vastly different team that&rsquo;s more suited to a playoff setting.</p>

      <label for="l84l10o" class="commentText"><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t call it weak at all.  Sure some teams like the Grizzlies folded because of the stuff going on with them, but I think it&rsquo;s a really hard conference where the records are depressed because they beat each other up.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people here are making the point that the Lakers COULD go on a run with the right matchups in the playoffs etc., but it&rsquo;s a bit of a crap shoot.  And that&rsquo;s on top of the Lakers having two aging stars that could be an injury away from sinking the ship for the season.</p>

<p>Then past their issues, the west is very young and some teams that aren&rsquo;t good like the Spurs have a much better path to being good and good for the long term.  Which, to me, means the Lakers job is the worst of both worlds.  A mediocre roster built around aging stars with no clear pull the band-aid off line of demarcation that still comes with way too high expectations and then the prospect of a rebuild with those same high expectations still in place.</p>

<p>I mean, “not very good” was a western conference finals team last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were a play-in team who got hot at the right time, and got a good bracket. They got swept in the WCF, and went immediately back to being a play-in team again this year.</p>

<p>They haven&rsquo;t been better than a play-in team in 5 years, and haven&rsquo;t won a playoff series outside of that WCF run in the same timeframe.</p>

<p>So, yes, they were a WCF team last year, but the preponderance of evidence is that they are a play-in team who got a fortunate run. They are also a team whose best player is a free agent who turns 40 this season.</p>

<p>The Lakers are much more than a good coach away from being a contender.</p>

<p>The West next year will be even better than this past year.</p>

<p>Denver, OKC, Dallas, Minnesota, Memphis, Clippers, Golden State, Pelicans, Kings, Phoenix, Houston, San Antonio - These are all potential play-off/play-in teams</p>

<p>yes yes, any team missing their 2 best players is going to look way worse.  but the top teams can survive without their best players for stretches cause they have so much depth</p>

<p>so I understand the reasoning just based on the apparent lack of depth the no-lebron lakers had.   westbrook was still a terrible choice but they could have made a better one</p>

<p>Luka and Kai + role players works because the role players handle the defense and the stars handle the offense. LeBron and AD cannot just stand in the corner on defense.</p>

Somebody who when they come in you can run a lot of touches for/facilitate the offense through, but also you know you&rsquo;re not going to get him every single night and you load manage him heavily throughout the season to make sure he&rsquo;s there for the postseason. If LeBron is a #1 or #2, you can&rsquo;t really do that in the same way imo.</p>

I think sometimes we get lost on like &ldquo;big 3 vs big 2&rdquo; &ldquo;how good is your x best player&rdquo; or whatever type standards. If Lebron and AD are playing like they played in the 2020 run and you have a handful of guys near Reaves&rsquo; level maybe that&rsquo;s good enough to contend. When Rui was playing at his highest level, and D&rsquo;angelo was playing like he did in the second half of last season maybe you have something. But that&rsquo;s 4 qualifiers, some not very likely. The window on how long and how consistently Lebron stays near that level shrinks by the day.</p>

<p>But yeah, the fact the list of positive attributes about the Lakers ends after &ldquo;AD, 39 year old bron, Reaves&rdquo; is uhhhh a thing</p>

      <label for="l84jfsd" class="commentText"><p>The unrealistic expectations is due to LeBron being there. Him being LeBron pressures whoevers running the Lakers to go all in and get him a chip before he declines, eventhough its financially incredibly difficult to pull off (they got no cap space at all. LeBron takes up 60 mil cap more than Luka and Tatum just to play &lsquo;part-time&rsquo; basketball, coasting and easily gassed with no defense).</p>

<p>If the Lakers have the Orlando Magic players for example, Hurley would easily take that team since he can develop them with no expectations to get a chip immediately even if its on the Lakers. LeBron is the key factor in this case.</p>

Family, friends, home, kids, not to mention that Uconn is kind of his baby now.  It’s the classic… do you stay the home grown kid for less money, glitz, glamour, or kind of throw it all way for the sparkly, buzzy, popular thing.  Kind of like in dating/marriage also.  </p>

For instance if Giannis decides to quit the NBA tomorrow and join some Saudi team for $100mil/yr, then that would clearly be a pure money decision. But this is more like if a top Euroleague player who won all the championships there and decided to come to the NBA. His role would be smaller, but he&rsquo;d make more money and compete at the highest level, for more prestige in front of more audiences and fans.</p>

If we relate this situation to how a normal person would think about changing jobs for a second he is being asked to move across the country and uproot his entire life for the what is essentially the same pay. Who would do that?  When you factor in that the job security working for the Lakers is going to be a lot worse than staying in Connecticut it makes a lot of sense why he would turn it down.</p>

For a guy whose game is highly dependent on athleticism, I wouldn&rsquo;t count on him being able to be the entire defense in any game, let alone every game. It&rsquo;s possible he could still be at that level but around age 33 it starts to become a question of when the decline will start to get noticeable.</p>

<p>They lack cap room sure, but you move off of Bron and AD and that’s wide open.</p>

<p>After next year. They own all their picks.</p>

<p>Hurley probably made the right decision but if in his shoes, with that contract he could’ve had 2 years of AD/Bron to improve around the margins and if that didn’t work have the security/chops (with good ownership) to build his own team in his style.</p>

<p>pretty sure the celtics, knicks, bucks, magic, pacers, 76ers, miami, okc, denver, wolves, clippers, dallas, and suns jobs are not coming available any time soon</p>

<p>also i guess i just disagree with the idea that this is not a team that can do something in the playoffs</p>

<p>they finished the season going 25-13 when Ham finally stopped being an idiot and just started the best 5 guys, for the season Prince started and played more mpg than Rui</p>

<p>Austin only starting <sup>57</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub> games is INSANE</p>

<p>there was a game where Austin, D&rsquo;lo, and Rui were all healthy and pockets started Reddish and Christie next to Bron and AD</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s no way this team couldn&rsquo;t have been a 50ish win team with better coaching</p>

<p>even with average to bad they were close to it</p>

<p>Ideally somewhere like Cleveland where you should be able to collect a check for the next 5-6 years while consistently making the second round, and you’ll probably get a shot at a title one year out of those anyways.</p>

      <label for="l84l826" class="commentText"><p>Bucks were dumb and allowed Giannis to veto Nick nurse who is the guy the buck really wanted. Because of this bucks hired AJ griffin who was clearly unqualified to be coaching a team like the bucks who wanted to contend right aways. That’s the FO fault.</p>

<p>Monty and Detroit is a similar situation. Monty rejected many advances from Detroit to take a break from coaching, pistons stupidly offered him the highest contract in NBA coaching history so Monty took it, he clearly wasn’t worth that money and didn’t want to be coaching so again that’s just dumb from FO for giving him that contract.</p>

<p>Describing Vogel as a championship coach feels a little disingenuous. He’s a good solid defensive coach who’s won a championship before, but he’s not really a coach who’s known for propelling teams to championship contention. He more just found lighting in a bottle with that lakers team. He’s a good coach with the right roster, but suns clearly weren’t a good roster for  Vogel, another just not very smart move from PHX to hire him to begin with. When I think championship level coach I think of Spo or Budenholzer</p>

<p>Vaughn was basically a place holder and he was never ever gonna keep the job long term in Brooklyn unless they were somehow very good under him which wasn’t going to happen with their limited roster. Vaughn just isn’t really a high level nba HC imo.</p>

<p>Wes unseld JR. Just got caught up in the wiz final deciding to rebuild after years of not doing that. I don’t think he’s a great HC, but him moving to the wizards FO wasn’t because he was an awful coach, he was mediocre and wizards wanna start over.</p>

<p>A lot of bad hires come down to NBA FO and ownership being dumb, obviously coaches share blame too, but like a lot of these guys had predictable outcomes due to the awful fit with the team hiring them. Like o still can’t believe bucks fired coach Bud, traded for Dame, then hired AJ griffin. It’s just insane.</p>

      <label for="l84ikd9" class="commentText"><p>Idk I gotta disagree here, I just don’t know if lakers are a 50 win team with Better coaching. West is just so tough and lakers heavily rely on lebron to make things work. He’ll always end up dealing with some sort of injury because of this over reliance.</p>

<p>I feel like your comment in general kind of shows the issue with the lakers job. When things go poorly the HC is literally always the first guy to fall on the sword In LA. I just have a hard time believing there are a Bunch of coaches out there who’d have this roster truly contending for a championship, they could maybe make a WCF run like they did a year ago, but outside of that it’s a very limited roster. Like this team doesn’t own its draft picks for years and this is the roster they have to show for it, it’s just not very good or enticing at all outside AD and lebron. If a new HC doesn’t have the lakers contending in a year or 2 there’s a good chance you’ll take the fall for rob pelinka just not doing a very good job.</p>

<p>I don’t think Ham was some great HC, but he’s not the reason Lakers aren’t contenders. Essentially if you don’t think you can have this current roster contending in the next 2 years, you shouldn’t take the job. That’s just a very tough ask for a HC. Hurley made sense because he was likely given assurances he’d be around after lebron I feel like.</p>

<p>the dude was starting Reddish and Christie over Rui, D&rsquo;Lo and Reaves even when they were healthy</p>

<p>the blame is deserved, every person on the planet was calling for Rui to start, for the season Prince still started more games and player more mpg than Rui</p>

<p>Rui as the starter (last 30 games) - <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> on <sup>57</sup>&frasl;<sub>45</sub> shooting lmao but yeah need Prince more</p>

<p>oh and of course they won at like 55 win pace, would they have done that for the season? probably not</p>

<p>but they won 47 games with the first half being a disaster cause pockets just wouldn&rsquo;t play his best 5 guys</p>

<p>i think 3-4 wins with better coaching is not unreasonable</p>

      <label for="l84mixh" class="commentText"><p>I’m not saying Ham deserves no blame, but I think you’re kidding yourself if you think this roster can truly contend as currently constructed. They’re simply just not as good or as deep as the top teams in the NBA, they didn’t lose to the nuggets because of poor lineup deployment necessarily, nuggets are just better. I think lakers need to seriously evaluate what they’re going yo do with this roster, because as things stand I don’t think it’s good enough around their 2 stars. Like I don’t think there’s any coach available out there who makes this team a contender which is what the goal should be.</p>

      <label for="l84e5y9" class="commentText"><p>They’ve got like one, maybe two years left being even this good, then it’s back to whether a huge star likes LA. Then, you considered it’s the Lakers and not even one championship will give you job security for long, you might have to win a couple. I’m not sure it’s even a guarantee they win a couple <em>series</em>. I’d avoid the media circus if I were a future head coach. A similar situation elsewhere may be preferable.</p>

<p>Lakers and Cavs are the only open rn</p>

<p>and Cavs fired their coach as soon as they got good and had expectations</p>

A new coach is going to come in just as the lakers realize they need to bottom out and rebuild.</p>

<p>why are we acting like these teams have proven anything aside from the Nuggets so far</p>

<p>OKC/Wolves don&rsquo;t have years of experience, and it&rsquo;s not always oh we had a good season, we&rsquo;re going to do the same or better next season, you&rsquo;ll have 53 win seasons where you lose in the second round in like 5, it happens</p>

<p>I mean people gave the Nuggets the benefit of the doubt despite not having a noticeably better RS than OKC or MIN. And then the playoffs came and they underperformed. So yeah it&rsquo;s fair to retract that benefit of the doubt retrospectively and say they were worse.</p>

<p>Obviously, normal people would take the money and it is an NBA opportunity, but it doesn’t look appealing for someone who can afford to be picky and is going to make all that money regardless</p>

      <label for="l849oqv" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not great because you&rsquo;re going to be eventually rebuilding with 32-33 year old AD, which means you&rsquo;d probably trade him unless you can somehow finagle two superstars to come replace LBJ in free agency (impossible).</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;re rebuilding, there&rsquo;s not many assets, the young core is uninspiring. It&rsquo;s just a prestige job in name only with a very bad hand of cards dealt.</p>

<p>Like if the Thunder job becomes available, I think he&rsquo;d jump. Or the Mavs or maybe even a team as bad as the Rockets. Because there&rsquo;s assets to build on and influence the kind of team you want to coach. But the Lakers are already bad and LBJ has maybe a year or two left before it gets really bad. If Redick cared about his long term head coaching prospects, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d do it either.</p>

      <label for="l84how4" class="commentText"><p>This is a pretty clownish take considering they made the West Finals a year ago and had a really competitive series with the Nuggets. The West was pretty congested and if you think you’re a better coach than Darvin Ham it isn’t hard to imagine getting your rotation figured out and winning a couple more games without any changes to the roster.</p>

<p>People will lap this up because “Lakers bad” but it’s not as if you have literally any team with openings available who have gone further in the last two years, and even if they did, would they have two All NBA caliber players?</p>

<p>This is an atrocious take.</p>

      <label for="l84hetg" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s right, but the Lakers also play by different rules than other teams, in many ways, they&rsquo;re like the Globetrotters of the NBA.  Players want to play there.  Stars demand trades to play in LA. No other teams except maybe the Knicks have that.</p>

<p>That all being said, it seems like they&rsquo;re like 1-3 years away from having to blow it up and I don&rsquo;t see the ownership tolerating a coach performing with a bad roster.</p>

<p>I always imagined him to look more like the Kentucky Fried Chicken guy. I guess we learn something new everyday.</p>

      <label for="l84fbel" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s complete incompetence at the top between Jeannie Buss, Rob Pelinka, Kurt and Linda Rambis. If these are the big 3 or 4 decision makers, you have little chance of being competitive in the draft, free agency, trades, assets and cap space management. The coach is just an annual scapegoat for the front office. First it&rsquo;s Mike Brown, then it&rsquo;s Bickerstaff, then Mike D&rsquo;Antoni, then it&rsquo;s Vogel, then it&rsquo;s Ham.</p>
