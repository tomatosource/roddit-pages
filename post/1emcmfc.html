</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We have 3 major candidates.</p>

<p>Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, and Cp3</p>

<p>Early 2000s. 2002-2003. Kidd was able to lead his team to back to back finals appearance. (Only losing to Shaq/Kobe Lakers and Big 3 Spurs respectively)</p>

<p>Everyone thought Kidd would be inarguably the best PG of the decade.</p>

<p>However, in Mid 2000s. 2005-2006. Nash was traded from Mavs to Suns.  And his partnership with coach Dantoni worked wonders. Unlike Kidd. Nash never was able to lead his suns team to a finals appearance. Usually losing to Spurs or Lakers before reaching the big stage. Still Nash won back to back MVPs in that stretch</p>

<p>Then Cp3 came to the party as a late game. 2006, he won Roy. 2007, he was not even an all star. But in 2008, he had a skyrocket leap. Not only he made all star. He became an MVP candidate!!!. And even placed second place behind Kobe Bryant (one of Top 10-12 all time players)</p>

<p><strong>My Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Cp3 kinda came late. And a good amount of his prime years will be in 2010s instead.</p>

<p>So, it is Nash VS Kidd.</p>

<p>Kidd back to back finals appearance was amazing.</p>

<p>But I will give the edge to Nash. Just because on how deep the wild west in his time.</p>

<p>So, I have (for 2000s)</p>

<p>1.Nash</p>

<p>2.Kidd</p>

<p>3.Cp3</p>

<p>Honorable Mention: Deron Williams, Tony Parker, Billups</p>

<p>CP3 has multiple better seasons, on worse teams with far better defense and coaches who weren&rsquo;t revolutionary. Paul is better than Nash at everything except 3PT shooting.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why the All NBAs and All defensive teams are so heavily in CP3&rsquo;s favor.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ll take Kidd, but the correct answer is Allen Iverson for obvious reasons, and I don&rsquo;t wanna hear about the efficency nonsense.</p>

      <label for="lgxwjdg" class="commentText"><p>I’m biased but Nash was phenomenal. His offences were absurd relative to his era, and bad luck was often the determining factor in their failure to make the finals in a tough west. Amare’s injuries, the Horry incident, hell Joe Johnson being more concerned with getting payed than playing a Klay-esque role on a super team, motherfucking Tim Duncan three pointers… it goes on.</p>

<p>Kidds Nets made the finals but the east was a joke, and then his role in Dallas later was important but he was no longer the driving force of the team.</p>

      <label for="lgxy89l" class="commentText"><p>Not sure if CP3 was really the same era as the other two given that he was drafted about ten years later.</p>

<p>The argument for Kidd and CP3 for me is that they were all-time greats on the defensive end in their primes where Nash was a significant negative.</p>

<p>Both could have easily won MVPs, which are often very narrative driven. Rightly or wrongly, there’s a chance that Kidd’s off the court actions cost him the MVP in 02, and Kobe not having won MVP in the past as he was approaching 30 was a legitimate factor for voters in 08.</p>

<p>The early 00s Nets was also probably a worse shooting cast than the 01 Sixers with AI, and Kidd dragged them to the finals twice, and were actually competitive against the Spurs in 03</p>

      <label for="lgxyjf4" class="commentText"><p>Most will say that Nash was a great system player. However, Nash WAS the system that D&rsquo;Antoni chose to use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very, very biased because Nash is my 2nd favorite player all time behind Wade, so take that into account here. Cp3, as you say, is a bit too young here, so really, it&rsquo;s between Nash and Kidd.</p>

<p>But Nash was simply the best offensive tool that the league had even seen up to that point. Yes, Magic running the floor was great, but he didn&rsquo;t have the shooting. Nash is what the peak point guard looks like (well, minus the defense). Great passing, great shooting, great driving.</p>

<p>When you factor in defense, Kidd makes up ground. But the overall ocean of difference between Nash and Kidd offensively is just too much.</p>

      <label for="lgxzxuk" class="commentText"><p>They were all great, but Jason Kidd is the best pg of the era. Kidd performed at an elite level at every facet of the game, and I think would have been a team elevator on every team in the league. Nash was great in Dallas and amazing in Phoenix, but I just don&rsquo;t think he could have been as impactful in many other places. Kidd was so good at everything and so capable of playing however he needed to; I think he would have raised the ceiling of pretty much any team in the league. Both were awesome. CP was great, but didn&rsquo;t win enough to be in the conversation imo. Kidd&amp;gt;Nash&amp;gt;Paul</p>

      <label for="lgxyaz5" class="commentText"><p>I consider him SG.</p>

<p>Same case as Jerry West.</p>

<p>Some people treat AI/Jerry as PGs. Some treat them as SGs.</p>

<p>But more people lean on SG. So I consider Them both as SG. Top 5 /6 SGs right there with Harden.
( behind MJ, Kobe, and Wade)</p>
