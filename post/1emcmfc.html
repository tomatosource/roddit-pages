</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We have 3 major candidates.</p>

<p>Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, and Cp3</p>

<p>Early 2000s. 2002-2003. Kidd was able to lead his team to back to back finals appearance. (Only losing to Shaq/Kobe Lakers and Big 3 Spurs respectively)</p>

<p>Everyone thought Kidd would be inarguably the best PG of the decade.</p>

<p>However, in Mid 2000s. 2005-2006. Nash was traded from Mavs to Suns.  And his partnership with coach Dantoni worked wonders. Unlike Kidd. Nash never was able to lead his suns team to a finals appearance. Usually losing to Spurs or Lakers before reaching the big stage. Still Nash won back to back MVPs in that stretch</p>

<p>Then Cp3 came to the party as a late game. 2006, he won Roy. 2007, he was not even an all star. But in 2008, he had a skyrocket leap. Not only he made all star. He became an MVP candidate!!!. And even placed second place behind Kobe Bryant (one of Top 10-12 all time players)</p>

<p><strong>My Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Cp3 kinda came late. And a good amount of his prime years will be in 2010s instead.</p>

<p>So, it is Nash VS Kidd.</p>

<p>Kidd back to back finals appearance was amazing.</p>

<p>But I will give the edge to Nash. Just because on how deep the wild west in his time.</p>

<p>So, I have (for 2000s)</p>

<p>1.Nash</p>

<p>2.Kidd</p>

<p>3.Cp3</p>

<p>Honorable Mention: Deron Williams, Tony Parker, Billups, Rondo</p>

      <label for="lgxwjdg" class="commentText"><p>I’m biased but Nash was phenomenal. His offences were absurd relative to his era, and bad luck was often the determining factor in their failure to make the finals in a tough west. Amare’s injuries, the Horry incident, hell Joe Johnson being more concerned with getting paid than playing a Klay-esque role on a super team, motherfucking Tim Duncan three pointers… it goes on.</p>

<p>Kidds Nets made the finals but the east was a joke, and then his role in Dallas later was important but he was no longer the driving force of the team.</p>

<p>*edit I’ve been reminded that Joe Johnson mostly left because Rob Sarver is a chode and a cheapskate. Sorry ISO Joe</p>

It was a total of <span class="math inline">\(5 million that prevented Johnson from re-signing with the suns. Not \)</span>5 per year. But $5M over 5 years. It’s a joke and Sarver is absolute garbage and cost the suns at least 1 title in that stretch.</p>

<p>Im so happy for Suns fans that he is gone because no fans of a professional sports team deserve a POS owner like Robert Sarver</p>

      <label for="lgyzsmk" class="commentText"><p>Realistically, on a team without so many good role players, 2011 Kidd&rsquo;s deficiencies would have be more apparent. The 2011 Mavs were so deep in role players that everyone could play to their strengths.</p>

<p>2011 Kidd straight up couldn&rsquo;t dribble to the rim or make layups. He shot 40% from 2 point range that season. 36% FG overall. That being said, he was still an elite passer and extremely important defender particularly because of the matchups we drew against a lot of big, strong guards.</p>

<p>Granted, Amare dictated a different approach with lots of elbow pick and roll, but they could have dragged those screens out higher. Hell, the year with Diaw in Amare’s place could probably have looked similar to the Curry Draymond dynamic.</p>

His control of the offense was pure mastery and his passing was INSANE. If advanced stats were more prominent during his time, he’d be remembered more fondly than he is. You can’t understand his full impact by looking at your run of the mill box score.</p>

<p>All anyone needs to know about Nash&rsquo;s impact is that the Suns went from 29 wins pre-Nash to 62 wins with him. And he actually missed 7 games that year and the Suns went 2-5 without him.</p>

<p>And in the following season, one which Amar&rsquo;e pretty much missed all of, the Suns still finished with 54 wins. Nash was the engine.</p>

Dude initiated sets with the ball maybe as much as some of our modern heliocentric players, but he was <em>so</em> active about it, and the Suns made really quick snappy decisions even in the half court. Didn&rsquo;t pound the ball like some slower paced PGs who had the ball a lot.</p>

<p>&lsquo;06 Suns had the second best offense only to Dirk&rsquo;s Mavs that made the finals. Their starting 5 was a 23 year old Diaw, Raja Bell, Marion(great but first option of the second best offense great?), and Kurt Thomas. 23 year old Barbosa, Tim Thomas, James Jones and Eddie House off the bench. There&rsquo;s some shooters in there, there&rsquo;s talent, but that&rsquo;s not an amazing offensive cast, and the only other creator is Diaw. Nash playing at a ridiculous pace and handling so much creation responsibility is the only reason that team does anything of note</p>

<p>No question Nash had a higher peak, but Kidd arguably had a better cumulative decade.</p>

<p>While Nash was definitely a &ldquo;MVP late bloomer&rdquo;, was already a great player even in Dallas, it&rsquo;s not like he made 3 all-star teams, he made 6 <strong>and</strong> won 2 MVPs in the 00s.</p>

<p>Yeah, Kidd led his team to two Finals, but out of the East that&rsquo;s significantly less impressive. I think Nash&rsquo;s peak was just <strong>so</strong> much higher, and whatever you think he lacks in the first ~2 years of the 2000s, he more than makes up later considering how Kidd wasn&rsquo;t quite himself by 2008.</p>

<p>Also, FWIW, Kid made the all-star team 7x in the 2000s.</p>

Kidd was 5X 1st team in the years of Iverson and Kobe, a very competitive time for guards, and was the best player on 2 finals teams. The east was weak sure. But while the Nets’ offense didn’t have the magic of 7SOL, Kidd certainly elevated everyone around him in a similar manner</p>

      <label for="lh0or43" class="commentText"><p>Kidd also had an underserved bad rep on 3pt shooting.  People said he can&rsquo;t shoot 3s.  While he wasn&rsquo;t great, he certainly shot good enough for that era.</p>

<p>Kidd&rsquo;s peak BPM and VORP are also higher than Nash&rsquo;s peak because of the defense that you mentioned.  And Nash&rsquo;s peak had a team specifically tailored for him.  He took over a bad team with tons of potential waiting to be unlocked.  Kidd simply took a bad team to the Finals.</p>

<p>People argued the Suns got robbed.  Here are the facts, the Suns never led the series score in that series.  They trailed 0-1, tied at 1-1, trailed 1-2, tied 2-2.  Then the game 5 suspension.  And in game 6 when they were back, they lost the game to lose the series 2-4.  Horry was still suspended in game 6.  Excluding game 5, they were still 2-3 in the series.</p>

But if he developed that shot, with his speed + midrange/floater, you wouldnt be able to sag off him at the arc and he&rsquo;d roast you when you got close.</p>

<p>Edit: If you disagree, all good, I’d be curious to hear where in your top 10 you have Nash in an all-time offensive players list</p>

<p>Ben Taylor from Thinking Basketball, one of the most respected basketball analysts there is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nash’s box stats compare favorably to the other modern offensive giants. Mathematically, his elite efficiency makes him one of the most valuable scorers ever. Using Jacob Goldstein’s method, <strong>Nash’s five-year run of volume and efficiency was the third most productive in NBA history, behind only Steph Curry and Michael Jordan</strong>. Per the scouting report, he could also ramp up his scoring when teams overplayed his passing: He tallied 25-point games nearly a quarter of the time during his Phoenix postseasons. And of course, Nash was the creation king:&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While he was able to log valuable seasons well into his mid-30s, Nash took a few years to hit his stride at the start of his career. By my valuations, he still racked up 11 All-NBA campaigns and five solid MVP-level seasons. Between his historically good shooting and passing, and the data suggesting nearly unrivaled value in Phoenix, I wonder if I’m underselling Nash’s peak. If I penalize him slightly less for poor fit, I’m still not sure he could crack the prestigious top-18, but I’m also not comfortable shaving too much more off his apex (which bounds him in the low 20s). <strong>With one of the five or six greatest offensive peaks ever,</strong> Nash lands at No. 19.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lgxyjf4" class="commentText"><p>Most will say that Nash was a great system player. However, Nash WAS the system that D&rsquo;Antoni chose to use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very, very biased because Nash is my 2nd favorite player all time behind Wade, so take that into account here. Cp3, as you say, is a bit too young here, so really, it&rsquo;s between Nash and Kidd.</p>

<p>But Nash was simply the best offensive tool that the league had even seen up to that point. Yes, Magic running the floor was great, but he didn&rsquo;t have the shooting. Nash is what the peak point guard looks like (well, minus the defense). Great passing, great shooting, great driving.</p>

<p>When you factor in defense, Kidd makes up ground. But the overall ocean of difference between Nash and Kidd offensively is just too much.</p>

<p>Truly a crime that they did not build any type defensive identity when they had them together. Even the 06 Dirk team did not look super talented offensively overall.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s honestly insane that Nash&rsquo;s impact could be measured like this.</p>

<p>You can see the impact of great players when you comb through individual stats. But for Nash, to actually understand his impact, you have to look at the team.</p>

<p>He became a starter only a few games into his first season, at 19 and a few months (which was rare back then).</p>

<p>The guy came, won in the NBA (and in FIBA leading his team, so he was good without his trio), made the playoffs for 16 years straight, retired with the second most Play Off points in NBA history (which still holds to this day) from a  true Point Guard.</p>

<p>I love the other 3, I understand somebody would chose them over Parker (and I might as well) but not at least including him in that conversation is a blasphemy indeed, imho.</p>

<p>It’s a team’s game, your role as a Point Guard is to help your team win, and that team won more games than any other franchise over his career.</p>

<p>He’s not the only one responsible for it obviously (which is a valid argument for almost every player) but he was certainly a big factor in  one of the most successful dynasties ever.</p>

      <label for="lgy2lcn" class="commentText"><p>Assuming the years 2000-2009, Nash over Kidd. I don’t think anyone else really has a claim. To go over the resumes:</p>

<p>MVPs: Nash- 2, Kidd- 0</p>

<p>All NBA: Nash- 6, Kidd- 5</p>

<p>1st Team: Nash- 3, Kidd- 4</p>

<p>All Star: Nash- 6, Kidd- 7</p>

<p>All D: Nash- 0, Kidd 8</p>

<p>1st D: Nash- 0, Kidd 3</p>

<p>Assist Leader: Nash- 3, Kidd- 4</p>

<p>50-40-90 club: Nash- 3, Kidd- 0</p>

<p>Finals Appearances: Nash- 0, Kidd- 2</p>

<p>Personally the MVPs really seal it for me. Both have extremely close resumes, with Kidd having way more D accolades and Nash having some shooting accolades. But it’s really hard to argue against a b2b MVP, Nash at that time was just an offensive genius.</p>

      <label for="lgypp28" class="commentText"><p>One of the best defenders of the era, top two passer of the 2000’s, got robbed of MVP by Duncan, and had arguments the next year as well. Carried the Nets to two finals appearances. Triple double machine. Just one of the best all-around players in history. I would take Jason Kidd over Nash easily. The only things Nash inarguably does better on the court is shooting and efficiency. If that tips the scale one way for you then so be it.</p>

<p>Nobody controlled the opposing team’s defense the way Kidd was able to. Just one of the best instinctive players ever. And he did that most of his career without being a threat from outside. Stats don’t do him justice on just how incredible he was to witness. A lot of people talking about it now didn’t get to see it in real time. Mr. Triple Double before Westbrook demystified the triple double in the modern era.</p>

<p>Both really great players though and two of the best point guards to ever play the game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but this is just cope. His Nets were ROUTINELY below average offensively in large part because Kidd was a terrible scorer.</p>

<p>Plus it&rsquo;s ironic to say Kidd</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nash because of defense, and then say Duncan stole Kidd&rsquo;s MVP lol. The only thing Kidd does better than Duncan is pass. Am I doing it right?</p>

Nash is a player who played great after rules were changed that greatly benefit his game.  They will point to undeserved MVPs, inflated 7 sec offense stats, and controlled advanced metrics&hellip; but the answer is Kidd easily. Nash can&rsquo;t even play defense lmao.  Even legends pick Kidd over Nash.</p>

      <label for="lgyw6mk" class="commentText"><p>This is a nuanced and reasonable take. I see these same figures and come away with Kidd as the winner - but either is defensible. No wrong answer here.</p>

<p>The deciding point for me is the Kidd was a very good offensive player and an awesome defender. Nash was an awesome offensive player and a bad defender. Nash’s stats also benefitted more from style of play. Kidd likely benefitted from a weaker conference but accomplished a more in the playoffs.</p>

<p>FWIW, I’m a lifelong Mavs fan and watched much of both careers very closely.</p>

      <label for="lgy7gn3" class="commentText"><p>I do think Nash was the best, but for a lot of people It&rsquo;s probably hard to separate him as a player vs what he meant to basketball at the time.  People who started watching NBA around 2010 on, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to overstate just how bad NBA offense was in the early 2000s.  Teams were struggling to get to 90 sometimes, it was just awful.  Steve Nash and the suns were a breath of fresh air, they made scoring look so easy, and Nash was the proto-Curry.</p>

<p>So yes, he was the best imo, but I think there&rsquo;s a lot of bias towards him because the suns were the only team worth watching most nights.</p>

      <label for="lgxy89l" class="commentText"><p>Not sure if CP3 was really the same era as the other two given that he was drafted about ten years later.</p>

<p>The argument for Kidd and CP3 for me is that they were all-time greats on the defensive end in their primes where Nash was a significant negative.</p>

<p>Both could have easily won MVPs, which are often very narrative driven. Rightly or wrongly, there’s a chance that Kidd’s off the court actions cost him the MVP in 02, and Kobe not having won MVP in the past as he was approaching 30 was a legitimate factor for voters in 08.</p>

<p>The early 00s Nets was also probably a worse shooting cast than the 01 Sixers with AI, and Kidd dragged them to the finals twice, and were actually competitive against the Spurs in 03</p>

<p>He also straight up started as a PG for multiple teams. Most people would consider shooting guards to be wing players in the aughts, allen iverson was mostly certainly not a wing player, and never had the size to compete with other wings on the defensive end despite having the quickness to beat them on the offensive end.</p>

Nash was in unbelievable shooter before shooting was valued like it is today. His passing was flashy and fun. He controlled the best offences in the game at the time. The Suns felt like everybody&rsquo;s second team. They were just great to watch. I&rsquo;d give Nash the nod. </p>

<p> I don&rsquo;t know where Nash is on all-time PGs but I&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;s on the top 5-10 conversation. Magic, Oscar, Stockton, Curry, Zeke..it&rsquo;s a deep list</p>

      <label for="lgy2jp3" class="commentText"><p>outside of accolades, nash&rsquo;s efficiency may put him over the top. jason kidd was the triple double guy of his era, multiple final appearances with the nets, better d. cant ignore the 2 mvps from nash obviously. if kidd was just reasonably efficient i might pick him, but considering nash was elite in that category i have to go with nash.</p>
