</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We have 3 major candidates.</p>

<p>Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, and Cp3</p>

<p>Early 2000s. 2002-2003. Kidd was able to lead his team to back to back finals appearance. (Only losing to Shaq/Kobe Lakers and Big 3 Spurs respectively)</p>

<p>Everyone thought Kidd would be inarguably the best PG of the decade.</p>

<p>However, in Mid 2000s. 2005-2006. Nash was traded from Mavs to Suns.  And his partnership with coach Dantoni worked wonders. Unlike Kidd. Nash never was able to lead his suns team to a finals appearance. Usually losing to Spurs or Lakers before reaching the big stage. Still Nash won back to back MVPs in that stretch</p>

<p>Then Cp3 came to the party as a late game. 2006, he won Roy. 2007, he was not even an all star. But in 2008, he had a skyrocket leap. Not only he made all star. He became an MVP candidate!!!. And even placed second place behind Kobe Bryant (one of Top 10-12 all time players)</p>

<p><strong>My Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Cp3 kinda came late. And a good amount of his prime years will be in 2010s instead.</p>

<p>So, it is Nash VS Kidd.</p>

<p>Kidd back to back finals appearance was amazing.</p>

<p>But I will give the edge to Nash. Just because on how deep the wild west in his time.</p>

<p>So, I have (for 2000s)</p>

<p>1.Nash</p>

<p>2.Kidd</p>

<p>3.Cp3</p>

<p>Honorable Mention: Deron Williams, Tony Parker, Billups, Rondo</p>

      <label for="lgyi5au" class="commentText"><p>I say this in every Nash-related discussion. He was a player you had to watch with your own eyes to understand his greatness. His control of the offense was pure mastery and his passing was INSANE. If advanced stats were more prominent during his time, he’d be remembered more fondly than he is. You can’t understand his full impact by looking at your run of the mill box score.</p>

<p>Nash was a late bloomer and didn&rsquo;t turn into &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; until Phoenix.  At which point the decade was already half over.</p>

<p>Kidd, on the other hand, was an 8x All-Star in the 00&rsquo;s.  Also lead a team to back-to-back Finals appearances and finished 2nd in the MVP vote one year.</p>

<p>No question Nash had a higher peak, but Kidd arguably had a better cumulative decade.</p>

<p>I think either is fine, just a classic peak vs longevity type debate.</p>

<p>While Nash was definitely a &ldquo;MVP late bloomer&rdquo;, was already a great player even in Dallas, it&rsquo;s not like he made 3 all-star teams, he made 6 <strong>and</strong> won 2 MVPs in the 00s.</p>

<p>Yeah, Kidd led his team to two Finals, but out of the East that&rsquo;s significantly less impressive. I think Nash&rsquo;s peak was just <strong>so</strong> much higher, and whatever you think he lacks in the first ~2 years of the 2000s, he more than makes up later considering how Kidd wasn&rsquo;t quite himself by 2008.</p>

<p>Also, FWIW, Kid made the all-star team 7x in the 2000s.</p>

<p>Defense is indeed half the game, but Kidd&rsquo;s defense just pales in comparison to Nash&rsquo;s offense. Nash has a very strong argument as being the best offensive player in NBA history, the run his Suns went on is just basically unmatched.</p>

<p>Kidd is arguably the greatest defensive guard in NBA history, but the catch is &ldquo;guard&rdquo;. His defensive prowess is just dwarfed by the better defensive big men.</p>

      <label for="lgynraz" class="commentText"><p>Right. It isn’t as clear cut Nash as people think. Kidd was 5X 1st team in the years of Iverson and Kobe, a very competitive time for guards, and was the best player on 2 finals teams. The east was weak sure. But while the Nets’ offense didn’t have the magic of 7SOL, Kidd certainly elevated everyone around him in a similar manner</p>

      <label for="lgxwjdg" class="commentText"><p>I’m biased but Nash was phenomenal. His offences were absurd relative to his era, and bad luck was often the determining factor in their failure to make the finals in a tough west. Amare’s injuries, the Horry incident, hell Joe Johnson being more concerned with getting payed than playing a Klay-esque role on a super team, motherfucking Tim Duncan three pointers… it goes on.</p>

<p>Kidds Nets made the finals but the east was a joke, and then his role in Dallas later was important but he was no longer the driving force of the team.</p>

<p>Ben Taylor from Thinking Basketball, one of the most respected basketball analysts there is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nash’s box stats compare favorably to the other modern offensive giants. Mathematically, his elite efficiency makes him one of the most valuable scorers ever. Using Jacob Goldstein’s method, <strong>Nash’s five-year run of volume and efficiency was the third most productive in NBA history, behind only Steph Curry and Michael Jordan</strong>. Per the scouting report, he could also ramp up his scoring when teams overplayed his passing: He tallied 25-point games nearly a quarter of the time during his Phoenix postseasons. And of course, Nash was the creation king:&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While he was able to log valuable seasons well into his mid-30s, Nash took a few years to hit his stride at the start of his career. By my valuations, he still racked up 11 All-NBA campaigns and five solid MVP-level seasons. Between his historically good shooting and passing, and the data suggesting nearly unrivaled value in Phoenix, I wonder if I’m underselling Nash’s peak. If I penalize him slightly less for poor fit, I’m still not sure he could crack the prestigious top-18, but I’m also not comfortable shaving too much more off his apex (which bounds him in the low 20s). <strong>With one of the five or six greatest offensive peaks ever,</strong> Nash lands at No. 19.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lgycq52" class="commentText"><p>Nash is probably the second best shooter in basketball history. And I don’t think we talk enough about that. If he had played on the era of the shoot-first PG, and raining down every 3 possible, his scoring numbers would’ve been incredible. But that was the game he was taught to play, so he was just a passing savant who hardly ever missed when he did shoot.</p>

<p>Nash had 4 straight 50/40/90 seasons and was .1% on his FTs from it being five.</p>

<p>I am not necessarily arguing he is a top 10 offensive player, but we can’t forget about his insane shooting splits when discussing his offensive game.</p>

<p>Only injuries/suspicious suspensions stopped him from winning</p>

<p>And defense. The suspensions weren&rsquo;t really &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; - it was a draconian rule (in response to the Malice at the Palace) that really needed some more leeway for guys taking a couple of steps off the bench and stopping far away from the fracas - but it was correct by rule and was applied pretty consistently to everyone. And even without those suspensions, they went 2-3 in the other games, and against a team they went 1-4 against the previous series (losing all three home games) and 1-4 again the time after that. Even without the suspensions it&rsquo;s far from a sure thing that they advance.</p>

      <label for="lgxyjf4" class="commentText"><p>Most will say that Nash was a great system player. However, Nash WAS the system that D&rsquo;Antoni chose to use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very, very biased because Nash is my 2nd favorite player all time behind Wade, so take that into account here. Cp3, as you say, is a bit too young here, so really, it&rsquo;s between Nash and Kidd.</p>

<p>But Nash was simply the best offensive tool that the league had even seen up to that point. Yes, Magic running the floor was great, but he didn&rsquo;t have the shooting. Nash is what the peak point guard looks like (well, minus the defense). Great passing, great shooting, great driving.</p>

<p>When you factor in defense, Kidd makes up ground. But the overall ocean of difference between Nash and Kidd offensively is just too much.</p>

<p>One, yes, Jordan is one of the best players to ever play the game.</p>

<p>Two, yes, Jordan is one of the best scorers to ever play the game.</p>

<p>But Jordan was not a system. Jordan was one of the greatest assets you can have because he was just so talented.</p>

<p>Please, I encourage you to look up what teams in the history of the NBA have the highest offensive rating relative to the league.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s honestly insane that Nash&rsquo;s impact could be measured like this.</p>

<p>You can see the impact of great players when you comb through individual stats. But for Nash, to actually understand his impact, you have to look at the team.</p>

      <label for="lgy2lcn" class="commentText"><p>Assuming the years 2000-2009, Nash over Kidd. I don’t think anyone else really has a claim. To go over the resumes:</p>

<p>MVPs: Nash- 2, Kidd- 0</p>

<p>All NBA: Nash- 6, Kidd- 5</p>

<p>1st Team: Nash- 3, Kidd- 4</p>

<p>All Star: Nash- 6, Kidd- 7</p>

<p>All D: Nash- 0, Kidd 8</p>

<p>1st D: Nash- 0, Kidd 3</p>

<p>Assist Leader: Nash- 3, Kidd- 4</p>

<p>50-40-90 club: Nash- 3, Kidd- 0</p>

<p>Finals Appearances: Nash- 0, Kidd- 2</p>

<p>Personally the MVPs really seal it for me. Both have extremely close resumes, with Kidd having way more D accolades and Nash having some shooting accolades. But it’s really hard to argue against a b2b MVP, Nash at that time was just an offensive genius.</p>

      <label for="lgy7gn3" class="commentText"><p>I do think Nash was the best, but for a lot of people It&rsquo;s probably hard to separate him as a player vs what he meant to basketball at the time.  People who started watching NBA around 2010 on, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to overstate just how bad NBA offense was in the early 2000s.  Teams were struggling to get to 90 sometimes, it was just awful.  Steve Nash and the suns were a breath of fresh air, they made scoring look so easy, and Nash was the proto-Curry.</p>

<p>So yes, he was the best imo, but I think there&rsquo;s a lot of bias towards him because the suns were the only team worth watching most nights.</p>

<p>This is honestly a crazy take, Duncan was by far the better player in that season. Like, it&rsquo;s not particularly close at all.</p>

<p>The voting results themselve don&rsquo;t move me much - there&rsquo;s been weirder ones before. Personally I just don&rsquo;t even see the argument for Kidd in 02, Duncan was simply a much better player at the peak of his powers, and the Spurs significantly outperformed the Nets in the regular season in a much tougher conference.</p>

      <label for="lgxy89l" class="commentText"><p>Not sure if CP3 was really the same era as the other two given that he was drafted about ten years later.</p>

<p>The argument for Kidd and CP3 for me is that they were all-time greats on the defensive end in their primes where Nash was a significant negative.</p>

<p>Both could have easily won MVPs, which are often very narrative driven. Rightly or wrongly, there’s a chance that Kidd’s off the court actions cost him the MVP in 02, and Kobe not having won MVP in the past as he was approaching 30 was a legitimate factor for voters in 08.</p>

<p>The early 00s Nets was also probably a worse shooting cast than the 01 Sixers with AI, and Kidd dragged them to the finals twice, and were actually competitive against the Spurs in 03</p>

Nash was a terrible defender who lucked into playing for D&rsquo;Antoni, and was given an incredible team (at least offensively) around him.  If you saw both of them play, youd know that Kidd was a better playmaker and ball distributor. Nash was a 7 apg PG in Dallas.</p>

<p>If you look up or remember their teams, the comparisons are absolutely laughable. Kidd had Kittles. Nash had Iron Joe. Kidd had Todd McCullough followed by Mr. intangibles Jason Collins (a center who averaged 4 RPG). Nash had Amare. I&rsquo;ll be nice and call Kenyon and Matrix a wash.</p>

<p>If Kidd was on the Suns and Nash was on the Nets, this would have never ever been raised as a question.</p>

<p>Paul Shirley is quoted in Bill Simmons&rsquo; book as saying (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing) that Nash&rsquo;s very presence made other players more unselfish on the court, making the extra pass and giving up good shots for great shots. Not a lot of players could make self-sacrifice for the greater good infectious, but Nash managed it.</p>

      <label for="lgybpo6" class="commentText"><p>Nash, Kidd, Chauncey, Toni and Cp are all similar. If we look pure basketball skills and abilities, cp3 is definitely the most skilled and versatile. But what about the mental part of the game? Leadership, work ethic and so on. Teams they played on, played against.</p>

<p>If i had to choose between them 5 as a starting pg for my new franchise…. The goal is to win. I’d be having hard time picking cp3 and Nash. Chauncey would’ve been my first choice because of his tenacious winning mentality that beats all others and only older Kidd and Toni could match it.</p>

<p>However, if the goal is to be consistently good in playoffs, attract fans, bring stars and play good basketball.. i’m going for Nash then Cp3. But all of them are elite point guards. All 5 of them would’ve been top10 in the league today.</p>

All three deserve so much praise for the way they were able to quarterback teams and get everyone involved.  And all three did it so differently.  For those too young to remember, Kidd was one of the few players who immediately made a significant impact on both sides of the ball wherever he went.</p>

The Suns felt like everybody&rsquo;s second team. They were just great to watch. I&rsquo;d give Nash the nod. </p>

<p> I don&rsquo;t know where Nash is on all-time PGs but I&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;s on the top 5-10 conversation. Magic, Oscar, Stockton, Curry, Zeke..it&rsquo;s a deep list</p>

<p>Also… Tony P was the only one with Chauncey to get a finals MVP during that time.</p>

<p>Gilbert was mostly a bunch of high scoring on a bad team that got nowhere but Parker &amp; Chauncey were pivotal to rings. Kidd was a important component to his but that was Dirk who carried the mother load.</p>

<p>I’m assuming AI is being counted as a shooting guard by the way.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be offended if anyone said Kidd or Nash. CP3, as you said, arrived too late to be considered the best PG of the decade.</p>

<p>Final thought, Kidd’s final appearances should not be used in his favor in this conversation, Nash’s Suns WCF teams would destroy Kidd’s finals Nets teams.</p>

<p>Prime CP3 was better than either, and his 2008 and 2009 were pretty dominant. But as you say, most of his prime was in the next decade.</p>

<p>pure production I guess you have to give it to Nash, but you look at other D&rsquo;antoni teams and it feels like his system elevated Nash.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d probably have it a tie with Kidd, Nash and CP3 each dominating a third of the decade.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ll take Kidd, but the correct answer is Allen Iverson for obvious reasons, and I don&rsquo;t wanna hear about the efficency nonsense.</p>
