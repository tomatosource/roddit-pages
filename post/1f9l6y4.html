      <p>If a team is rebuilding and trying to put butts in seats, why not take a flyer on players that might do some flashy stuff or have a cult following (e.g. McClung, Marjanovic, Fall, other &lsquo;novelty&rsquo; players, even John Wall for the Wiz) to give the fans an alternative to watching developing players get smoked every night?</p>

<p>At the end of the day, basketball is theater. I’d rather see a chaotic, And-1 / Globetrotters-esque game as the &lsquo;opening act&rsquo; than a bunch of scrubs pretending that they’re going to win more than 20 games in a season. If you’re gonna lose, lets see some oops, some broken ankles.</p>

<p>I suppose &lsquo;development&rsquo; is the response, but I’m a DC native, so I&hellip;don’t believe in that any more.</p>

It&rsquo;s just too much body to try to keep up with the modern game for more than a few minutes at a time. Boban is a per36 freak but there&rsquo;s a reason he has played so little despite being in much better shape than Bhular. The only guys 7&rsquo;2+ who can stay on the court that long are usually very slim, long, and lanky. The days of needing a giant bruiser just to be able to foul Shaq and slow him down are long gone.</p>

<p>I mean sure it’s a 2nd round pick, but those fucking matter. Denver got an MVP who got them a ring out of one. We were still freshly stung by how poorly Mark and Mavs GM Donnie Nelson were performing after the Mavs 2011 championship. And then to just play around in the draft in Dirk’s final seasons of productivity? Fuck off Mark lol.</p>

<p>Sim Bhullar actually kinda had ball skills (debatable if at the NBA level), he just needed to lose like 50-60 pounds.</p>

<p>Satnam Singh could barely jog as an 18 year old.</p>

      <label for="llmvufz" class="commentText"><p>I did a big number crunch a handful of years ago and found that outside of the #1 pick your chance of getting an all star is under 20% almost immediately. For example, at the time I looked it up, the #8 pick hasn’t been an all star since like 1991 and had 0 all-nba appearance as well.</p>

<p>I’m on your side on this, and while it may seem like 20% is relatively high, the overwhelming majority of those 20% are 8-12th guys on a roster with the exceedingly rare all star (I wanna say the average is less than 1 all star is drafted in an average second round but it’s been a while since I looked at this).</p>

<p>Outside of the top 5 picks, a rotation guy on a good contract is worth more than anything you can get.</p>

<p>I believe pro athletes get taxed based on what city they are playing in. But if you are playing half your games in Canada with a tax rate of 50%that’s higher than the 40% rate somewhere like Florida/texas.</p>

<p>Places like Texas and Florida, with zero state income tax do have a tax desirability advantage, but if a player would sign with the Nets but not the Raptors, it’s not for tax reasons.</p>

If that gives that chance that Lebron stays in LA, Bronny who was a top player going into college before his cardiac arrest somehow turns into a role player, or at the very least gives more marketing crap, why wouldn’t you?

      <label for="llny7gv" class="commentText"><p>That made me even more convinced it was a dumb move FYI.</p>

<p>Because that 20% probably didn’t include declared-but-undrafted</p>

<p>And, not every 2nd rounder even gets on a roster ever.</p>

<p>So yeah teams clearly value 2nd round picks as a dice roll to accrue assets. They’re used as trade sweeteners all the time. Is an individual pick very valuable? No. But again it’s specifically about WHEN Cuban did it in 2015. And I’d take a random draft-and-stash over a PR stunt that didn’t even really garner that much holding power for Indian interest. The guy literally could barely jog.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not some untapped pool of players out there who can do these things at-will against NBA talent.  This was kind of what people thought Washington would be last year: bad, but it might be fun to see Poole with a permanent green light.  It turned out to not be fun.  The other players you mentioned, yeah Boban is a novelty but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much entertainment value in seeing him struggle to defend a P&amp;R 30 times a night.</p>

<p>That verbiage would need to change in the next CBA.</p>

<p>Interestingly I just looked this up for the MLB and they do not make this distinction. Maybe because dogs are batboys in the minor leagues.</p>

If you&rsquo;re tanking, it&rsquo;s a good opportunity to give guys minutes that you aren&rsquo;t sure about ability wise. Why sign a player for &ldquo;fun,&rdquo; when you can give your rookie 2nd rounder a chance? Sure, your team is gonna suck either way, but there&rsquo;s still plenty of value to be had from a scouting perspective.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like tanking teams totally stop caring about winning. They just care about winning in the future, so they&rsquo;re still better off not doing dumb stuff in the present</p>

Sure your city&rsquo;s team won&rsquo;t win much, but at least the tickets are super affordable and you have something to do a few nights almost every week from October to April. That&rsquo;s definitely something I would do at least if I had disposable income and lived in a city with a bad NBA team.</p>

<p>Those tickets are usually cheapest tickets you will find anywhere from Washington to Boston and everywhere in between.</p>

You may get a solid 3 game boost at best and if 1 or 2 of the games are on the road then nothing was gained.</p>

      <label for="llnu6q4" class="commentText"><p>I think the implication here is that the owner is bought in to the idea. OP isn’t suggesting a GM just goes rogue with a dumb idea like this just for fun. He’s suggesting a franchise consciously decides to build a fun team for fans in a year they weren’t going to contend anyway</p>

<p>It’s a bad idea because as others have said there isn’t a magic untapped pool of players that can do what OP is suggesting. But it wouldn’t get the GM fired. anybody that’s competent enough to become a GM is competent enough to get owner approval before a crazy change in direction like this.</p>

Playing the and-1 mixtape all stars isn&rsquo;t going to ensure that your assets that other teams may want get the stats or time they need.</p>

      <label for="llo9k3q" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s the biggest reason. It&rsquo;s not a ticket-driven league like the NHL or even MLB. It&rsquo;s got solid revenue-sharing. A team doesn&rsquo;t deeply care about putting butts in the seats, especially at the cost of developing asset value.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to instill winning qualities in young, developing players when you aren&rsquo;t giving them complimentary players who make sense on the court, plus some veterans who might only see garbage time but have a lot of experience to draw from in the locker room and practice court. Hell, for the extreme rebuilding teams, the games are just a formality between the practices and training.</p>

      <label for="llmk5rf" class="commentText"><p>Because McClung can only do it in the dunk contest without people guarding him, or playing off of superstar playmakers. And because these &ldquo;entertainers&rdquo; would be atrocious at doing their entertaining moves as the player the opposing team focuses even slightly on stopping, ending with maybe 10 highlight moments a year against 1000 lowlights. That doesn&rsquo;t sell seats, at best it sells a 5 minute YT video.</p>

<p>This is where you went wrong.</p>

<p>***At the end of the day basketball is a competition.***</p>

<p>The theatre is just a coincidental but entertaining byproduct. It&rsquo;s very much an enjoyed and important aspect, but players play for the money and competition not your entertainment. Your entertainment is secondary. Yes there are showman players, but don&rsquo;t let their showmanship fool you, they are still primarily concerned with achievement and money.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;ve every played a highly competitive sport past high school because a couple minutes against elite defenders at the college level and above would eliminate that delusion real quick.</p>

<p>If you get McClung in there, he&rsquo;s going to get gassed chasing steph around screens, get like 8 points,3 assists, 3 rebounds within the flow of the offense, and never dunk the ball.</p>

<p>More frustrating than the front office that put that cash-grab-personified team together was the fans who ate it up and are still convinced that playoff rondo would have saved our post season&hellip;.that team may have been the most profitable team of all time as both Wade and rondo were signed on very friendly deals, sold a bunch of merch, and had  post season sales.</p>

Alston went through the community college route because he didn&rsquo;t have the grades to play in Cardozo high school, and he only became a playground legend because he had a difficult home life and preferred playing ball than dealing with his crackhead father whom made a habit of stealing Rafer&rsquo;s stuff.</p>

<p>If anything, teams had a huge amount of trepidation signing a known playground legend and show man because it could be a distraction and possibly disrupt a locker room.</p>

They had KJ Martin too, all he does is dunk the ball. Go watch the 2021-22 Rockets highlight reel, it&rsquo;s amazing dunk after dunk but the stands are still completely empty cuz the team won like 20 games.</p>

<p>Guess what? People still didn&rsquo;t show up to the games. The facts are majority of people would rather watch a boring winning team than a sportscenter losing team.</p>

A tank is about more than just doing bad to get a high pick, it&rsquo;s about managing assets to increase long term success, even if its at the expense of short term results.</p>

<p>Teams don&rsquo;t care about putting butts in seats. This is outdated thinking. They make most of their money from TV contracts, which aren&rsquo;t that strongly related to whether the team is good or not.</p>

<p>No it&rsquo;s a competitive sport.</p>
