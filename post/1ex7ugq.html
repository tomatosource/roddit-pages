      <label for="lj46tej" class="commentText"><p>I was a subscriber to SLAM from 2004 until 2022. They stopped sending me issues even though I still had at least two-three years left on my subscription. Any attempt to contact them was just met with, &ldquo;Oh I need to connect you to a different department&rdquo; rather that was phone call or email. After several attempts I finally gave up.</p>

<p>So in short, SLAM sucks to me now.</p>

      <label for="lj7y6jv" class="commentText"><p>Same, I was a subscriber for a long time until some years back when I moved to a new place and decided to re-subscribe.</p>

<p>But it was a waste of time just cause I had the number <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in my address, the online form refused to recognize that number and I tried emailing them, they were like &ldquo;Oh. Maybe use B or something, I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. They didn&rsquo;t care. It was a unprofessional email I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was hearing.</p>

<p>I ended up not subscribing. Their response baffled me and saddened me. I loved SLAM in its early days and you could tell the people working on it cared about the subscribers a lot more.</p>

      <label for="lj4nsdm" class="commentText"><p>I began reading SLAM around 1996 or 1997 and it felt revolutionary for me back then as a middle schooler. Up to that point, most basketball publications had a sense of formality (Sports Illustrated, Sport, Hoop, Street &amp; Smith) so I remember SLAM being the first publication that felt edgy and maybe even cool.</p>

<p>For a while, especially before the internet became saturated, SLAM was a pretty key outlet for me in terms of tracking up &amp; coming stars, seeing the Slamadamonth, reading the Noyz bar at the bottom, seeing who graced that beautiful glossy cover, etc.</p>

<p>To this day, <a href="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/2/super-bad-chauncey-billups-and-the-pistons-beat-the-odds-slam-cover-getty-images.jpg" target="_blank">Chauncey&rsquo;s 2004 championship cover</a> is still one of my all-time favorite magazine covers.</p>

<p>At some point, the style began to wear on me as I got older and I found myself just buying it out of habit. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t a perfect magazine—often it felt they swapped journalistic objectivity for access, sometimes the pop culture references felt hamfisted, and they may have lost a good deal of their edge as they swapped editors (shout out to Tony Gervino)—but it&rsquo;s been a pretty great run nonetheless.</p>

<p>I still have years of SLAM sitting in my mom&rsquo;s basement.</p>

      <label for="lj4tvo2" class="commentText"><p>Same here. I was buying SLAM right from the start. My walls were plastered with a ton of great posters and ads from their pages. Some of the best were the mid 90s Converse react ads (Spree, LJ, Webber).</p>

      <label for="lj5umdj" class="commentText"><p>My dad used to buy me issues in the mid 90’s and I collected until I graduated HS. I started buying them again a few years ago. I even buy older issues, from the 90’s, when I find them less than $20. I miss when Scoop Jackson had more influence.</p>

      <label for="lj6st48" class="commentText"><p>I bought the early 3 years issues. I was a french student and it was expensive but soooo worth it. Many trash talk lines had me laughing hysterically. The posters were high quality. The covers! And their ear-to-the-ground articles about a certain Kobe Bryant or Rucker Park legends.</p>

<p>And the writing, man, the writing&hellip;</p>
