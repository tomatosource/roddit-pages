      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1foevwa/shelburne_jayson_tatum_had_been_doing_twoadays/"><p>[Shelburne] Jayson Tatum had been doing two-a-days with his longtime skills coach Drew Hanlen and physical therapist Nick Sang to address a mechanical issue in his jumper that had come up early last season and reared its head again during the playoffs and Olympics.</p>
</a>

      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/41400876/boston-celtics-championship-honeymoon-12-days" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Horford arrived back at the facility on Sept. 1, he found someone else had beat him there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking in at 8, 8:15 a.m. and JT&rsquo;s already done,&rdquo; Horford said. &ldquo;Which means he must&rsquo;ve got there at 6 a.m.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed Tatum had, even though he&rsquo;d just returned the night before from a weeklong trip to China with Jordan Brand. &ldquo;It was easy to get up early,&rdquo; Tatum told ESPN, noting the jetlag would kick in later in the day. And he said it would also allow him to pick up his son, Deuce, from school.</p>

<p>But Tatum wasn&rsquo;t just there at 6 that first week. He had been doing two-a-days with his longtime skills coach Drew Hanlen and physical therapist Nick Sang to address a mechanical issue in his jumper that had come up early last season and reared its head again during the playoffs and Olympics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think a lot of people are like, &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s out for revenge,&rsquo;&rdquo; Hanlen told ESPN. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Jayson looks at it like that. He&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Compare my résumé at 27 to Michael Jordan, who never won one at 27. Compare it to LeBron, who had won one. Compare it to Steph, who had one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for what happened this summer, Tatum let his extra work serve as his comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jayson, I thought, handled everything like a total pro and champ and put team first and won his second gold medal right after winning his NBA championship,&rdquo; Stevens said. &ldquo;I also think that those guys will take any motivation that they can get to work and get better.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lopic5g" class="commentText"><p>I have to wonder how many superstars need to actively manage their mechanics vs just shooting as if it&rsquo;s second nature. You see players like Steph and Luka throw up super random shots with no mechanics and it&rsquo;ll still go in somehow. KD doesn&rsquo;t do those crazy stuff but his stroke is super smooth.</p>

Near the tail end of the season and almost all playoffs, he took forever to adjust his shot form to account for his injured knee, and it still wasn&rsquo;t as good as it was earlier in the season.</p>

      <label for="lopowa6" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s an adjustment period to the mental load you get when moved on-ball like JT has been. Off-ball you can watch the play and set your feet while finding your spot, and you get a half second to compose yourself while the ball&rsquo;s on the way to you. Running point you&rsquo;re doing if/thens for every other matchup on the floor, if you get an opening you have to take it as soon as you see it with no anticipatory period.</p>

<p>This is particularly relevant to Jayson because up until he made the league the only thing he was ever asked to do with the ball in his hands was shoot or iso. Guards who have been bringing the ball up since AAU have been doing that for years before getting to the pro level.</p>

<p>Hes adjusting his mechanics constantly, he can feel when something starts getting  out of whack when shooting from deep. So he&rsquo;ll recalibrate by starting close to the basket and tinker with his shot until its straight again, and then slowly move back out to distance.</p>

      <label for="loq7r8x" class="commentText"><p>Yea, at the end of the day, it’s all a feel for the game. Knowing the distance and how much power to put on a shot is not something everyone learns at the level that guys like Luka and Steph has. Same thing with throwing a football. You can chuck it over the mountain but accuracy at the elite levels isn’t something you learn. It’s second nature to these guys</p>

To be clear I think it is a mechanical issue with his shot, but not because he bulked up or needs wrist surgery. I think it&rsquo;s more likely that since he became a primary ball handler and playmaker on the team, he might have picked up some bad habits on his shot.</p>

      <label for="loqf361" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s realistically just all normal mechanical deviation that needs to be corrected.</p>

<p>Our bodies grow/change slightly over time in all sorts of ways.  For something like a 3-point jump shot, all it takes is one little hitch or angle to be off and suddenly the ball isn&rsquo;t falling consistently anymore.</p>

<p>If it were injury related it should theoretically impact his FT% too, but that&rsquo;s been consistently near perfect.  In the same postseason he shot 28% from 3 on 9 attempts per game, he shot 86% from FT on 9 attempts per game.  When 3P and FT are so wildly un-correlated like that, there&rsquo;s either really bad luck, tiny sample size, or mechanics are off.</p>

<p>I would lean towards luck or sample size given he shot 41% from deep post All-Star break last year.  But it&rsquo;s pretty clear there&rsquo;s a consistency issue, and I think that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s trying to address.</p>

      <label for="loppwb3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, for all of his &lsquo;issues&rsquo; last year, he still shot 38% from 3 (on over 8 attempts), which he hadn&rsquo;t done since 20-21. With his percentage dropping in the playoffs, I absolutely acknowledge that he is addressing something that probably needs to be addressed, but people overstate how much of a problem it is imo</p>

      <label for="lopxan7" class="commentText"><p>15 pounds is hardly anything though and he wouldn&rsquo;t just smack it on in a couple of weeks. He wouldve started adding mass slowly over the course of the offseason. Lets say he took a month off after the playoffs and stopped end of September before training camp, 3 months.</p>

<p>Thats 5 pounds a month. Thats never going to mess up someones body mechanics so much, especially when he will still be training and shooting in that timeframe.</p>

<p>Bulking up affecting shooting is 1970s mentality and is always massively overstated in its affect on a player’s shooting. It&rsquo;s always related to something else (usually not focusing on shooting enough).</p>

<p>I would love for the downvoters to actually debate on this. If putting on muscle affected shooting why would great shooters ever risk it? Steph has bulked up, KD, Ray Allen. Lebron bulked up and improved his shooting.</p>

<p>For the amount of weight needed to affect his shooting, Tatum would be legit fat due to the amount of calories needed in the timescale we sre talking about.</p>

      <label for="lorme3b" class="commentText"><p>Bodybuilders are at the extreme end of physical limits so it becomes much harder to pack muscle onto an already near maximised frame at the peak of their genetic potential.</p>

<p>Much the same way an absolute elite NBA player can only improve round the margins of their game at the absolute top end of their potential. Anecdotally I have gained 14 lbs in 3.5 months since June and I am far from the resources Tatum has access to. I have also similarly lost 20 lbs in 3 months in the past. In this time my meager basketball skills remained constant. However I accept this is anecdotal so am opening myself up to the &lsquo;lul&rsquo; responses.</p>

<p>Also remember we are talking about offseason here for Tatum, he didn&rsquo;t have to travel for games etc. His sole goal was improving for the next season which meant increasing his bodyweight in a controlled environment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying its easy, Im saying its very achievable for a professional athlete with Tatums resources and dedication.</p>

<p>If it truely was the weight gain affecting his shot, why have countless other NBA players bulked up from rookie seasons with no noticable impact to their shooting percentages? If it was the weight gain, why did his shooting go from 38% in the regular season to 28% in the playoffs. Surely he would&rsquo;ve adapted to the changes by then or at least not regressed?</p>

<p>We can argue the semantics on the exact amount of weight gained, but it doesn&rsquo;t take away from the real poijt of my comment.</p>

<p>An NBA player adding muscle will not affect their jumpshot assuming the weight gain isn&rsquo;t insanely unhealthy (e.g 25lbs + a month) and assuming they continue to work on their key basketball skills to keep the connection to those mechanics and their changing body.</p>

      <label for="loq3cyy" class="commentText"><p>I did a mini-dive into this a few months ago, and a ton of the variance in JT&rsquo;s 3P% can be traced to how close he&rsquo;s guarded.</p>

<p>Essentially all players shoot significantly worse when coverage is &ldquo;tight&rdquo; or &ldquo;very tight&rdquo; as opposed to when they&rsquo;re open or wide open, but JT&rsquo;s splits are a bit larger than normal.</p>

<p>Knowing that, his seemingly odd career 3P% progression makes perfect sense.  He was lights out early in his career b/c teams didn&rsquo;t respect his shot, so a larger percentage of his 3s were open or wide open.  That&rsquo;s gradually changed, to where now a lot more of his 3s are with tight coverage.  And that&rsquo;s especially pronounced in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The past playoffs were an extreme example.  He actually shot fine when open (38%) or wide open (39%).  But 13% of his 3s were with tight coverage, and he was a ghastly 10% on those (after being around 30% the two prior seasons), which tanked his overall average down to 28%.</p>

      <label for="loqvq62" class="commentText"><p>This wider than normal variance could support that its a mental/mechanical thing then, right? That he&rsquo;s maybe overcompensating/speeding up too much when closely guarded so his shot is a lot more loose? Makes sense in that case that he&rsquo;s working extra with Drew to drill down on the fundamentals so he can rely on it in the clutch but still not sure why his physical therapist needs to be there</p>

<p>That just sheet body mass, does eff with your stroke.  Plus like others have mentioned, he has had some minor-ish wrist injuries, that have lingered throughout parts of the last two years.</p>

<p>As a Celtics fan.. super excited to hear that he’s re-baselining his form and mechanics with his team.  Was definitely hoping he’d focus on this, after his shooting woes the last 6 months.</p>

<p>It’s way more herky jerky now. There’s a hitch in his release and it looks like he’s loading it up and then kinda flinging it instead of one smooth motion.</p>

Tatum seems to have taken it in stride and seems to be the same guy as before.  I think there&rsquo;s a lot of players that wouldn&rsquo;t be the case.  One of his best attributes is how good a head he has on his shoulders.  Fun to root for even if he is underperforming.</p>

<p>This was more than his 9.1 drives in the regular season. He shot 37.6% from 3 this season on high volume so when his shot stopped working he adjusted and attacked more. (His pull up shooting attempts were slightly down despite playing more minutes).</p>

The mavs would drop 3+ guys to defend when he went to the rim which left others like DWhite wide open to rain 3s. It’s why the narrative of Tatum not doing anything in the playoffs was so stupid. If you’re watching the box score it might look like that, but if you’re watching the game you can literally see his impact.</p>

I feel like in most cases similar to this, a star doesn&rsquo;t go back to fix things in his games if they start to reach success despite certain parts regressing. The numbers don&rsquo;t really reflect it too much, but it was an issue in the playoffs despite them running through everyone. If he gets back to making that side step 3 sheeeesh.</p>

      <label for="lopscpf" class="commentText"><p>I know Tatum had the wrist injury, but I wonder how much of this is due to all the muscle he&rsquo;s added. He&rsquo;s very effective getting downhill, so that seems to have paid off. Though his muscle memory when shooting could possibly be out of sync. Also worth noting Tatum can take a lot of threes off the dribble, which are typically tougher to consistently make at high percentages as well.</p>

      <label for="lopydq7" class="commentText"><p>I posted this in another reply:</p>

<p>15 pounds is hardly anything though and he wouldn&rsquo;t just smack it on in a couple of weeks. He wouldve started adding mass slowly over the course of the offseason. Lets say he took a month off after the playoffs and stopped end of September before training camp, 3 months.</p>

<p>Thats 5 pounds a month. Thats never going to mess up someones body mechanics so much, especially when he will still be training and shooting in that timeframe.</p>

<p>Bulking up affecting shooting is 1970s mentality and is always massively overstated in its affect on a player’s shooting. It&rsquo;s always related to something else (usually not focusing on shooting enough).</p>

      <label for="loq8wsv" class="commentText"><p>It sounds like a lot but like I say, its 5 pounds a month (or less if he started gaining earlier in his offseason). Elite athletes can genuinely fluctate that much in a day especially if they have a particularly carb heavy day of eating.</p>

<p>Its a slow, manageable gain in weight that the body can easily adapt to with continued practice on his mechanics.</p>

<p>The added weight doesn&rsquo;t explain why he started shooting somewhat poorly before improving mid season and slumping late. He went from 38% to 28% in the playoffs, suggesting something else going on.</p>

      <label for="lorxy4a" class="commentText"><p>It takes somewhere around 2500-2700 calories per week above you base maintenance calories to gain 1lb of lean muscle mass.</p>

<p>No one is going to add 100% lean muscle mass, its nearly impossible. However is it so far out of the range of believablilty that an NBA player, with access to the best quality food, chefs and time to train and recover (e.g. multiple hours of sleep daily) could not possibly eat and extra ~390 calories per day and gain mostly lean muscle?</p>

<p>I would imagine Tatum needs anywhere around 3600-4000 calories to maintain his weight, so 3990-4390 to gain. A lot but considering its literally part of his job, it&rsquo;s not outrageous to see him do it if he was dedicated. It would take some calorie dense meals and high calorie shakes to get the volume in but again he doesn&rsquo;t need to prep the food, clean up, do anything he doesn&rsquo;t want to except focus on his training and sleep.</p>

<p>This is someone who is dedicated to improving and reaching the peak of his ability. He is determined enough to do that consistently for a short period. I doubt he was continuing to bulk over the actual season, and would agree it wasn&rsquo;t possible if it was claimed he gained in that context, but offseason is well within the realms of possiblity.</p>

      <label for="lophp6s" class="commentText"><p>Yes probably. If Tatum switched trainers I could see him finally making that leap to a legit MVP candidate. The results don&rsquo;t lie. We can see almost all of the players he trains get worse or stay the same.</p>

      <label for="lotxylo" class="commentText"><p>Im gonna assume ur talking abt playoffs since JB doesnt even have an argument in the regular season. Tatum was our best player for the entire playoffs, including in the Finals (led the team in pra). JB was more &ldquo;clutch&rdquo; but Tatum was better for most of a game. He also has the most playoffs points for a player under 27 in NBA history,  so I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s pretty good at scoring too, alongside all the stuff you said. Also, the Celtics are above average without him but nowhere NEAR a championship team.</p>
