      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1foevwa/shelburne_jayson_tatum_had_been_doing_twoadays/"><p>[Shelburne] Jayson Tatum had been doing two-a-days with his longtime skills coach Drew Hanlen and physical therapist Nick Sang to address a mechanical issue in his jumper that had come up early last season and reared its head again during the playoffs and Olympics.</p>
</a>

<blockquote>
<p>When Horford arrived back at the facility on Sept. 1, he found someone else had beat him there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking in at 8, 8:15 a.m. and JT&rsquo;s already done,&rdquo; Horford said. &ldquo;Which means he must&rsquo;ve got there at 6 a.m.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed Tatum had, even though he&rsquo;d just returned the night before from a weeklong trip to China with Jordan Brand. &ldquo;It was easy to get up early,&rdquo; Tatum told ESPN, noting the jetlag would kick in later in the day. And he said it would also allow him to pick up his son, Deuce, from school.</p>

<p>But Tatum wasn&rsquo;t just there at 6 that first week. He had been doing two-a-days with his longtime skills coach Drew Hanlen and physical therapist Nick Sang to address a mechanical issue in his jumper that had come up early last season and reared its head again during the playoffs and Olympics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think a lot of people are like, &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s out for revenge,&rsquo;&rdquo; Hanlen told ESPN. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Jayson looks at it like that. He&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Compare my résumé at 27 to Michael Jordan, who never won one at 27. Compare it to LeBron, who had won one. Compare it to Steph, who had one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for what happened this summer, Tatum let his extra work serve as his comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jayson, I thought, handled everything like a total pro and champ and put team first and won his second gold medal right after winning his NBA championship,&rdquo; Stevens said. &ldquo;I also think that those guys will take any motivation that they can get to work and get better.&rdquo;</p>
