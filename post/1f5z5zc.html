<p>Watching him leave that switch flipped during the olympics was crazy cuz like, he&rsquo;s playing against the best player in the world, while teamed with the best players in the world, and for much of the games, he&rsquo;s still arguably the best player on the court.</p>

      <label for="lkxskaz" class="commentText"><p>While leGM and front office are both responsible to a degree for team construction, ultimately the biggest issue is Lebron simply isn&rsquo;t exceeding the value of his contract anymore -&amp;gt; I&rsquo;m not talking about in business revenue sense in which he&rsquo;s underpaid, I&rsquo;m not talking about other max players are better on avg, but I&rsquo;m talking about winning championships with the current NBA salary caps.</p>

<p>Almost every championship team had &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; value pieces (if not someone straight taking a pay cut) because it is impossible to have a team all &ldquo;worth&rdquo; their contract or worse win it all. Sometimes it is less visible because the value contracts were on critical rotation pieces rather than the stars, but almost every championship team has that&hellip; It&rsquo;s like most people not realizing Nuggets had pretty bad chances this year compared to last year as all they see is Yokic, Murray, Gordon, MPJ are still there. But no, the team lost critical pieces and no one outside of Jokic is exceeding their contract value enough to be championship level.</p>

<p>Lebron at the top is a definitive no on the contract value at this point. So for his team to have any chance they need super value pieces elsewhere AND fit well with him.</p>

<p>Olympics just gets rid of that problem completely.</p>

<p>Steph can score and create off ball gravity and LeBron can play make and defend to cover Steph. And they can both stop carrying shit rosters to the play in. Steph to the Lakers as a close out tour to retire on a win with LeBron in 2026. You heard it here first. </p>

<p>Edit: Franchise &ndash;&amp;gt; roster. Both teams have great stories histories, especially the Warriors over the last ten years. But for the last few seasons they have been play in teams due to poor play by the team outside the superstars. Apologies for ruffled feathers. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That would mean Steph forcing a trade to the Lakers since Steph signed the extension through 2027.  Steph has indicated multiple times, as recently as when he signed the extension a couple days ago, that he would like to only play for one franchise his entire career and that he seeing the possibility of winning still in the Bay (with how aggressive the Dubs went after PG and Lauri and probably seeing some internal growth with the current roster).  So unless ownership/FO decide to pull a 180 and not try to be competitive, then Steph is staying.</p>

<p>You know what would the ultimate &ldquo;let&rsquo;s try to be competitive to make Steph happy&rdquo; move?  Swing a trade to the Lakers for Lebron.</p>

<p>We got prime LeBron effort on offense and defense with the shortened quarters and deeper bench.</p>

<p>Plus the fact that he is Captain America and the competitiveness of all the greatness on the team pushed him to show why he&rsquo;s the best of his generation. He scored at all will all Olympics and still got everyone involved and raised the standard for the whole team.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t <em>bad</em> either but he had ups and downs that about cancelled out to neutral</p>

<p>Team USA is a very specific case where he&rsquo;s legitimately able to give close to prime-level of effort because of the nature of the roster not tiring him out as much</p>

      <label for="lkwvd2x" class="commentText"><p>This is why I said he had ups and downs though rather than him actually being bad</p>

<p>He&rsquo;d make some amazing breakup plays and then the next possession not rotate for an MPJ or KCP open three because he was tired from playing offense</p>

<p>I think that him ranking high in those stats reflects the fact that he has bursts where he plays amazing defense but can&rsquo;t always maintain it for a full 48 minutes</p>

<p>Small sample still but coincidentally 57.1% is also Jokic’s career playoff 2P%. Which is like, quite good of course. So no clamps from LeBron or anything but somewhat impressive given the size difference if you choose to trust the small sample at all and not treat it with a grain of salt.</p>

He just often doesn&rsquo;t want to because he has to conserve energy for a whole season. But challenge his ego once, and he&rsquo;ll sprint the entire length of the court just to crush your dunk against the backboard.</p>

<p>The man still regularly blocks layups after getting beaten off the dribble. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the best strat is to take him out of the defensive play entirely, make him neither the on ball nor the help defender. Which is easier said than done.</p>

      <label for="lkwuiet" class="commentText"><p>I totally agree. I’m the biggest Rose fan I’ve ever met and Lebron in that ECF is the only person who ever clamped prime MVP Rose. They were trapping him as soon as he crossed half court and he had Rose backpedaling and throwing errant passes and just killed his confidence. Honestly it upset me that Rose never even tried to attack him those games, it’s like he conceded he couldn’t get past him without even trying.  Prime Dwight Howard also gave Rose problems around the rim but it was nothing like Lebron picking him up as soon as he crossed half court that series.</p>

<p>Scottie pippen, who sat courtside that whole series, infamously said after that series that Lebron is a better overall player than MJ. That series was a Lebron masterclass. And the Bulls winning Game 1, their 4th win in a row against that newly formed heat big 3, was the absolute peak of that team. All downhill from there sadly.</p>

<p>LeBron was also playing Center and protected the rim so many times in the Playoffs.   Especially against the Spurs</p>

He’s probably the best player (easiest to see) where you can see the IQ in action where he can map things out and guess them before the action happens (like in the first sequence). Most highlights were watching crazy skill and athleticism but these are so cool because you can see how he understands the game.</p>

<p>There’s one from the Cleveland days where he figures out GSW pick and roll rules and fakes them out for a pass to an open 3 that is just chefs kiss</p>

<p>He averaged 3 blocks and 3 steals in games 5-7. 6 stocks per game in huge stakes while dropping 41 points. He was calling out the warriors sets. His hands were everywhere. He was deterring shots at the rim and his ability to play free safety made the warriors a bit hesitant when he was around.</p>

      <label for="lkxgh5q" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think that his footwork is &ldquo;better&rdquo;. He just adapts to the situation. He doesn&rsquo;t need crazy footwork on offense, as he just needs to barrel down the lane or go for a step back 3/fade away. It&rsquo;s obviously easier to dictate the game and how you want to move on offense as you&rsquo;re in control.</p>

<p>On defense, you are mostly reacting to the actions of the opponents. But that means that you have to move your feet as you can&rsquo;t just guess which side your opponent will attack. Especially against someone like Jokic, who can kill you in every way possible with hook shot, spins, weird fade aways or just bully you to the rim.</p>

<p>Someone like Jrue has always impressed me the most with his movement. Never seen someone move past screens on defense as easily as him and still be a menace even when his opponent passes him. He&rsquo;s not even that explosive, but he is very shifty and his bball iq helps him make reads in advance. Still blows my mind that he has never won the DPOY, when someone like Smart has.</p>

<p>Probably the best guard defender I&rsquo;ve seen in decades. In an era with more elite scoring guards than ever.</p>

<p>He’s also a phenomenal center too.</p>

It&rsquo;s how we know the years between Lebron and Jordan&rsquo;s primes were a relative low point since very few stars actually made it from that time.</p>

This just shows you that when he doesn’t have to shoulder the entire offensive load he can actually put his effort into defense and play great.</p>

      <label for="lkwtcr2" class="commentText"><p>Fun fact: Lebron played just 3 minutes in the 2004 semifinals loss to Argentina that put team USA in the bronze medal game. Yet not only does he get the blame, James, Wade, and Carmelo all <em>accept</em> the blame for that loss even though they were glued to the bench.</p>

He was objectively the worst player in that game.</p>

<p>As you mentioned, Lebron only got 3 minutes. Carmelo was a DNP.</p>

<p>If all LeBron could do on offence was cut and dunk, he would’ve probably gone down as one of the defensive players ever if he could’ve just saved all his energy defence.</p>

<p>People often overlook the value of weight in defense. Look at Jrue Holiday with 229 lbs. The only thing bronny probably got from his father is the weight cause he is 210 lbs at 19</p>

      <label for="lkwucpg" class="commentText"><p>He is also willing to do it. He gets a lot of criticism when he doesn&rsquo;t but he is one of the few superstars who will actually guard the opponent&rsquo;s best player. There is always the risk of getting embarrassed especially when  guarding out of position against star players but Lebron accepts the responsibility. There is always a big risk he gets scored on and gets all the blame for the loss as the opponent star makes a highlight reel on him.</p>

<p>The only other big names I see do this besides Lebron are Jimmy Butler, Tatum, and Kd. Sadly none of these players get the defensive recognition they deserve.</p>
