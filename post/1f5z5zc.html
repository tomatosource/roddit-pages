<p>Watching him leave that switch flipped during the olympics was crazy cuz like, he&rsquo;s playing against the best player in the world, while teamed with the best players in the world, and for much of the games, he&rsquo;s still arguably the best player on the court.</p>

      <label for="lkxskaz" class="commentText"><p>While leGM and front office are both responsible to a degree for team construction, ultimately the biggest issue is Lebron simply isn&rsquo;t exceeding the value of his contract anymore -&amp;gt; I&rsquo;m not talking about in business revenue sense in which he&rsquo;s underpaid, I&rsquo;m not talking about other max players are better on avg, but I&rsquo;m talking about winning championships with the current NBA salary caps.</p>

<p>Almost every championship team had &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; value pieces (if not someone straight taking a pay cut) because it is impossible to have a team all &ldquo;worth&rdquo; their contract or worse win it all. Sometimes it is less visible because the value contracts were on critical rotation pieces rather than the stars, but almost every championship team has that&hellip; It&rsquo;s like most people not realizing Nuggets had pretty bad chances this year compared to last year as all they see is Yokic, Murray, Gordon, MPJ are still there. But no, the team lost critical pieces and no one outside of Jokic is exceeding their contract value enough to be championship level.</p>

<p>Lebron at the top is a definitive no on the contract value at this point. So for his team to have any chance they need super value pieces elsewhere AND fit well with him.</p>

<p>Olympics just gets rid of that problem completely.</p>

      <label for="lkzvk4n" class="commentText"><p>Isn&rsquo;t the point more that the current salary cap basically ensures that <em>no one</em> on a supermax contract is truly worth their percentage of the cap from a basketball standpoint?</p>

<p>The other poster said a championship team requires surprise contributions from a lower paid player, which honestly rings pretty true to me. The way it&rsquo;s constructed means even two superstar players starts to mean you need value guys at other positions.</p>

<p>Steph can score and create off ball gravity and LeBron can play make and defend to cover Steph. And they can both stop carrying shit rosters to the play in. Steph to the Lakers as a close out tour to retire on a win with LeBron in 2026. You heard it here first. </p>

<p>Edit: Franchise &ndash;&amp;gt; roster. Both teams have great stories histories, especially the Warriors over the last ten years. But for the last few seasons they have been play in teams due to poor play by the team outside the superstars. Apologies for ruffled feathers. </p>

<p>Fuck me, the theory <em>did</em> pan out and it is just incredible to watch. No doubt that spending $1M/yr on his body has helped, but it&rsquo;s still unfathomable to watch.

      <label for="lkwrp68" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll probably get downvoted because this is a LeBron post but I thought that his defense wasn&rsquo;t necessarily &ldquo;great&rdquo; in the playoff series against the Nuggets this year</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t <em>bad</em> either but he had ups and downs that about cancelled out to neutral</p>

<p>Team USA is a very specific case where he&rsquo;s legitimately able to give close to prime-level of effort because of the nature of the roster not tiring him out as much</p>

      <label for="lkzk8dj" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s the shit your coach used to tell you all the time in basketball when posting up a mismatch. Even if he scores, make him work for it. He&rsquo;ll think twice about taking the post up because he knows he&rsquo;ll have no breath for the next possession on defense trying to move you around. That&rsquo;s the whole point. You notice on one of the plays, when Lebron realizes Jokic backs him down and has him beat, he commits the intentional foul before he can put up a shot attempt to reset the possession and play ball denial again. The man has incredible basketball sense and is like an on court coach. That&rsquo;s why so many players hold him in such high esteem.</p>

<p>Small sample still but coincidentally 57.1% is also Jokic’s career playoff 2P%. Which is like, quite good of course. So no clamps from LeBron or anything but somewhat impressive given the size difference if you choose to trust the small sample at all and not treat it with a grain of salt.</p>

He just often doesn&rsquo;t want to because he has to conserve energy for a whole season. But challenge his ego once, and he&rsquo;ll sprint the entire length of the court just to crush your dunk against the backboard.</p>

<p>The man still regularly blocks layups after getting beaten off the dribble. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the best strat is to take him out of the defensive play entirely, make him neither the on ball nor the help defender. Which is easier said than done.</p>

      <label for="lkwuiet" class="commentText"><p>I totally agree. I’m the biggest Rose fan I’ve ever met and Lebron in that ECF is the only person who ever clamped prime MVP Rose. They were trapping him as soon as he crossed half court and he had Rose backpedaling and throwing errant passes and just killed his confidence. Honestly it upset me that Rose never even tried to attack him those games, it’s like he conceded he couldn’t get past him without even trying.  Prime Dwight Howard also gave Rose problems around the rim but it was nothing like Lebron picking him up as soon as he crossed half court that series.</p>

<p>Scottie pippen, who sat courtside that whole series, infamously said after that series that Lebron is a better overall player than MJ. That series was a Lebron masterclass. And the Bulls winning Game 1, their 4th win in a row against that newly formed heat big 3, was the absolute peak of that team. All downhill from there sadly.</p>

<p>LeBron also guarded MVP Derrick Rose during their playoffs matchup.  Rose was cooking until LeBron clamped him up in the 4th.  Bulls had no answer for it</p>

<p>LeBron was also playing Center and protected the rim so many times in the Playoffs.   Especially against the Spurs</p>

<p>Miami LeBron was literally guarding 1-5.</p>

He’s probably the best player (easiest to see) where you can see the IQ in action where he can map things out and guess them before the action happens (like in the first sequence). Most highlights were watching crazy skill and athleticism but these are so cool because you can see how he understands the game.</p>

<p>There’s one from the Cleveland days where he figures out GSW pick and roll rules and fakes them out for a pass to an open 3 that is just chefs kiss</p>

      <label for="lky1xpe" class="commentText"><p>There’s a Thinking Basketball video on LeBron being an all time great and he’s telling Shane Battier where to go. Battier of all people was supposed to be this intangible master, awesome defender, went to Duke cultivated an image and LeBron saw the game much better than him. It made me appreciate the mastery so much more</p>

      <label for="lkx81vg" class="commentText"><p>Lebrons defense in the 2016 finals is a big reason why they were able to come back in that 3-1 series.</p>

<p>He averaged 3 blocks and 3 steals in games 5-7. 6 stocks per game in huge stakes while dropping 41 points. He was calling out the warriors sets. His hands were everywhere. He was deterring shots at the rim and his ability to play free safety made the warriors a bit hesitant when he was around.</p>

      <label for="lkxgh5q" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think that his footwork is &ldquo;better&rdquo;. He just adapts to the situation. He doesn&rsquo;t need crazy footwork on offense, as he just needs to barrel down the lane or go for a step back 3/fade away. It&rsquo;s obviously easier to dictate the game and how you want to move on offense as you&rsquo;re in control.</p>

<p>On defense, you are mostly reacting to the actions of the opponents. But that means that you have to move your feet as you can&rsquo;t just guess which side your opponent will attack. Especially against someone like Jokic, who can kill you in every way possible with hook shot, spins, weird fade aways or just bully you to the rim.</p>

<p>Someone like Jrue has always impressed me the most with his movement. Never seen someone move past screens on defense as easily as him and still be a menace even when his opponent passes him. He&rsquo;s not even that explosive, but he is very shifty and his bball iq helps him make reads in advance. Still blows my mind that he has never won the DPOY, when someone like Smart has.</p>

<p>Probably the best guard defender I&rsquo;ve seen in decades. In an era with more elite scoring guards than ever.</p>

If the Lakers find a way to have his minutes reduced to 30min or less and actually be competitive, they will be dangerous.</p>
