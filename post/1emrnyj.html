    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>KD has played 16 seasons in the NBA, has 14 all-star selections, 11 All-NBA selections (6x first-team, 5 time 2nd-team), 11 top 10 MVP finishes, has averaged 20+ points for 16 seasons, 25+ points for 15 straight seasons, 25/5/5 for 8 seasons, and has nearly 29K points. He‚Äôs also been to 4x Olympics and is on the verge of having 4 gold medals, along with being team USA‚Äôs all-time leading scorer by over 150 points.</p>

<p>How good is his longevity historically compared to other players?</p>

<p>The story of his life. 2nd best player his high school. 2nd pick in his NBA draft. 2nd in MVP voting 3 times.</p>

<p>Joined the dynasty Warriors team to win rings the easy way and still treated as their 2nd best player.</p>

      <label for="lh1eyfx" class="commentText"><p>I wonder if time will be kinder to Durant since he won back to back FMVPs. Yes the team was stacked, but in the parity era it&rsquo;s extremely difficult for any team to repeat.</p>

<p>Big what-if as well - I think the Warriors would&rsquo;ve 3-peated had he not been injured. Joining that elite company would have made his perception a lot different in my opinion</p>

      <label for="lh1gjmr" class="commentText"><p>I always use the following as an example:</p>

<p>Imagine if, in 1996 after the 72-10 Bulls swept the Magic in the ECF, Shaq left the Magic and joined &hellip;.. the Bulls (instead of the Lakers). Would anyone give credit to Shaq for winning the next two titles?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why people dislike and discredit KD. A historically great team added a top 3 player to overload the team like crazy. But maybe people will be kinder over time. I can only speak for myself.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t give KD any credit for those two rings. He took the easy path to rings. The weakest move by a superstar in NBA history.</p>

      <label for="lh29zv4" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. The discourse around KD like he‚Äôs disrespected is absurd. He made the most  sorry move in league history and seems confused why he doesn‚Äôt get respect. Which is hilarious because before he made the Golden State move he was the most babied superstar in the league. Nothing in OKC was ever his fault</p>

<p>From a basketball standpoint he‚Äôs at his best when he can just go one on one. He‚Äôs not a leader, not a great passer and he‚Äôs not a great defender, he doesn‚Äôt handle double teams well. The idea of who KD should be and his efficiency numbers make people think KD ranks higher than he should. And it‚Äôs reasons like this why I hate stat watchers because it will have those people thinking KD is better all time than guys like Steph, Kobe or Larry Bird</p>

      <label for="lh3hdtd" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s because he is a better offensive player than Kobe, even factoring in the playmaking (kobe clear advantage), shot selection (clear advantage Durant), and ability to handle double teams (push, if not slight advantage to Durant). His legacy will never match Kobe because of the number of rings and the move to GSW.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too, they went out of their way to recruit him, it isn&rsquo;t like he showed up at their doorstep asking to join and they said &ldquo;Yeah, i guess you can tag along&rdquo;.

<p>When Kevin Love joined the Cavs he was a 25 year old 2x all NBA 2nd team member and had averaged 26 ppg(right behind LBJ‚Äôs 27ppg) the season before.</p>

<p>Kyrie was a 2x allstar and in 2016 he outplayed the unanimous mvp in the finals.</p>

<p>They were both top 25 players. You must be joking üòÇ</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t blame him for doing it, I just don&rsquo;t think it makes the Title a very impressive accomplishment.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah those are a little less impressive too. I think the difference was that Durant was already on a team roughly comparable to the 2011-2014 Heat, and way better than the late 00s Cavaliers, <em>before</em> he switched to the Warriors.</p>

<p>If KD had dragged the Nets to a title, he would&rsquo;ve had a lot less hate too, but he didn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a chance the &ldquo;Golden State couldn&rsquo;t win anymore without KD&rdquo; narrative would form eventually, but they won it all again so that died before it could.</p>

<p>KD needed the Warriors just as much as they needed him. And KD gets all the shit even though the Warriors were the ones that couldn‚Äôt close out a 3-1 lead after winning 73 games.</p>

Everyone tries to paint the picture that the Warriors had the league locked up without Kd and that just put them over the top but we know they didn‚Äôt. We saw them without him twice and they lost.

<p>The Warriors were built around Steph&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses through YEARS of drafting and trades, their entire system was built with his playstyle in mind and they played around him, it&rsquo;s OBVIOUS that whenever he sat, the team would play significantly worse compared to when KD sat, this stat doesn&rsquo;t tell us literally anything.</p>

<p>Kevin Durant was the best player on the Warriors during his stint there, it was clear as day and NOBODY relevant ever questioned it. The entire debate at the time was if KD was closing the gap on LeBron, Steph was an afterthought.</p>

      <label for="lh3nbs9" class="commentText"><p>OKC had the blueprint, they just used the wrong player to do it, had terrible injury luck and ran into some insane teams. Kevin Durant needs a point guard and a leader with him, bonus points if you can have the same player do these things. The blueprint was so right that, even though Westbrook was not the right point guard or leader for a guy like KD and he struggled to win playoff GAMES without Kevin, it still almost worked.</p>

<p>OKC made 3 WCFs and an NBA Finals with KD, the idea that we don&rsquo;t know how to build a championship team around him is insane. If they had slightly better coaching, a less erratic and inconsisntent PG in Westbrook&rsquo;s place OR didn&rsquo;t run into the dynastic Spurs/prime LeBron, they would&rsquo;ve won a title.</p>

All time does is create more players your legacy has to compete with and recency bias basically always wins.

I was a KD defender once upon a time and then the Brooklyn/Phoenix stints happened and now it‚Äôs pretty tough to argue on his behalf. Great player but you can‚Äôt put him in that upper echelon. I‚Äôd say even the Giannis and Jokic careers will both age better.</p>

<p>Steph led in many advanced stats from 2016-17 to 2018-19 on the Warriors, and the Warriors offensive system was critically built around him. And hell, <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10037874-with-or-without-kevin-durant-stephen-curry-runs-the-warriors-show#:~:text=In%20each%20year%20of%20their,100%20possessions%20in%202018%2D19." target="_blank">Steph&rsquo;s on-off differential was higher than KD in each year of their partnership</a>.</p>

<p>KD is a generationally talented player, but he never won at the highest level without another alpha player on his team.</p>

<p>Curry did. Twice (almost thrice).</p>

<p>Not to take away from how incredible KD was, and just how dominant he&rsquo;s been in the playoffs for most of his career. And of course his offense got a lot better playing next to a defense breaking cheat code in Steph&hellip;.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not crazy to suggest Steph was still the best player on those teams.</p>

      <label for="lh1vp6z" class="commentText"><p>Reaaaaally disrespectful to compare Durant to Melo tbh lol.</p>

<p>Melo was a sensational scorer, but subpar to useless garbage in every other part of the game. Brought no leadership, hustle, and accountability, and was never interested in playing winning basketball. Gave zero fucks on defense, and was more interested in money and fame than winning games.</p>

<p>KD is Melo but bigger, plays the game the right way, and better to significantly better than Melo at everything basketball. Frankly, for team basketball, I&rsquo;m not sure there was anything Melo was better than KD at. Maybe dribbling?</p>

<p>KD is one of the easiest players in the NBA to build a championship contending team around, and he&rsquo;s arguably the best drop in player in NBA history because of how incredibly flexible he is offensively (i.e. great off ball or with the ball).</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a world in which KD leaves OKC in 2016 to join another team (e.g.Celtics or Wizards) and lead them to a ring. And we&rsquo;d be talking about him very differently. Or ofc he joins another team and is still ringless; he chose to get easy rings instead of earning them the hard way.</p>

      <label for="lh1wqvo" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I tried not to frame it that way because an elite version of Melo to me is pretty game breaking.</p>

<p>And by all means Durant has far more utility, but I&rsquo;m just curious as to why Durant hasn&rsquo;t had more success outside of GS? I agree completely if he led OKC or any team to a ring he&rsquo;d be talked about differently but the problem is.. he didnt.</p>

<p>I suppose I&rsquo;m more genuinely wondering why that&rsquo;s been the case, just bad luck? Same era as LeBron?</p>

<p>Variety of reasons. The Kyrie experiment was a predictable dumpster fire. And they were still KD&rsquo;s toe from going to the Finals (and likely winning) despite all the injuries and drama.</p>

<p>The Suns situation is wacky, but the Beal trade was kinda shit &hellip;. but maybe if they&rsquo;re all healthy and have some better fitting role players around them, they might turn it around&hellip;.</p>

<p>KD has been pretty damn good in his twilight years so far. But it&rsquo;s a team sport. It&rsquo;s hard to win.</p>

<p>I think the original comment was comparing KD to Melo offensively, in which he called KD an elite version of Melo. But yeah he&rsquo;s lacking in all the other aspects.</p>

<p>Looking back I think he made the right choice, it&rsquo;s better to get easy rings and then try to win one on your own, instead of trying alone for years and potentially retiring without one.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs more that a ‚Äúpure scorer‚Äù like those two need more around them to actually win than a guy like LeBron. You need a primary defender, playmaker, paint presence and still need a secondary scorer like every team does. So it‚Äôs not necessarily his playstyle not meshing well as much as it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs a bit difficult to build a team around a guy whose only truly elite skill is scoring. The same was true with Melo but that doesn‚Äôt mean a team can‚Äôt do it, just that it‚Äôs harder than it is with a Jokic, LeBron, Luka, type of player.</p>

      <label for="lh1yirb" class="commentText"><p>Kobe and Kevin Durant are two of my favorite players in NBA history. Their skill sets have helped develop my basketball skills throughout the years.</p>

<p>Looking back to the 2008 Redeem Team, Kobe instilled hard work ethic in this new generation of players LeBron, Melo, Wade, etc.</p>

<p>Then later on his career Kobe developed his post skill set training with Hakeem.</p>

<p>Kobe worked on developing the triple threat and helped develop players skill sets i.e. Kawai Leonard, Paul George, Demar DeRozan, Kyrie Irving, among so many other modern players.</p>

<p>Kevin Durant&rsquo;s height as well as agility allows him to pull up on anyone and being able to create the space as well as the handle to get to the rack. His selfless playing also shows great basketball IQ because he plays the game the right way and gets his teammates involved. Also he is underrated on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Seeing his adjustments and being able to create separation and spacing against players such as Wembenyama is remarkable to see.</p>

      <label for="lh31tlf" class="commentText"><p>It really isn&rsquo;t, they themselves talked about this and openly stated that they didn&rsquo;t know what was &ldquo;working hard&rdquo; until they played with Kobe and realizing he was different. Melo/LeBron/Wade even talked about how the entire Redeem Team would go out to party, comeback at 5 am and meet Kobe in the hotel lobby going to the gym, something that eventually inspired them to follow him and go to the gym at 5 am.</p>

<p>You can even see that as a testament to their talent, as even though they weren&rsquo;t working as hard as they could, they were insanely great. Nobody is saying that they didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;work hard&rdquo; at all, but you can work hard for NBA standards and not work hard for Kobe Bryant&rsquo;s standards, in fact that happened more often than not, Kobe worked harder that 99.9% of players ever and was notorious for his inhuman work ethic.</p>

<p>Just because they were all NBA players at the time does not mean they didn&rsquo;t have more to learn as the great players are always learning.</p>

<p>If they had nothing to learn why would players such as LeBron follow in Kobe&rsquo;s footsteps and work on post moves with Hakeem.</p>

      <label for="lh1eniw" class="commentText"><p>I wonder if he can break into the top 5 of scoring all time before he retires&hellip;</p>

<p>Currently at 28,924 points. Assuming he averages 20 per game for 65 games a season, that&rsquo;s 1300 points a season. If he does that for 4 more seasons (he&rsquo;ll be 36 prior to this season so taking him to age 40) - that&rsquo;ll be 5200 points. That would bring him over 34K points, putting him #4 all time ahead of Kobe, MJ and Dirk.</p>

<p>Is that level of production reasonable up until he&rsquo;s 40? 20 PPG is low on the points side - he&rsquo;s averaged at least 25 every season excluding his rookie year. 65 games might be a bit of a reach (aside from last season, he&rsquo;s been injury prone since Brooklyn).</p>

We all love to talk about how Lebron is special because of his longevity, but step is 36 still showing no signs of slowing down. kd is turning 36 soon as well, and James Harden is about to be 35. All of them are still playing at a high level at ages that used to be a sign someone‚Äôs career was ending soon.

      <label for="lh41k4m" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say not all time great, but very good.  He&rsquo;s played 1061 games in 16 seasons which puts him 114th all time.  Most of the guys ahead of him on the list played fewer than 16 seasons (Boris Diaw, for example sits a few games ahead of KD all time having only played 14 NBA seasons before leaving the league).</p>

<p>So relative to his peers, he&rsquo;s got longevity.  Historically, he&rsquo;s not even close to being on the short list of guys like Kareem, LeBron or Malone.</p>

<p>Now if you go minutes played, his stature grows a little more historically, as he sits at 48 all time.  He&rsquo;s basically in a dead heat with DeRozan and Westbrook.  So again, really good longevity.  Probably not gonna be considered an iron man when all is said and done.</p>

      <label for="lh430lu" class="commentText"><p>I mean, his longevity is obviously bonkers, objectively speaking. The fact that he came off an achilles injury and still continued to produce big numbers is a testament to that longevity. Obviously the current sports medicine and general knowledge has helped with that but his game ages very well in a vacuum, as well. People thought Durant would be good into this mid thirties when he was 21 years old. When you&rsquo;re that tall and that good of a shooter with a good enough handle to get to your spots, it&rsquo;s just unfair.</p>
