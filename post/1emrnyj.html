</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>KD has played 16 seasons in the NBA, has 14 all-star selections, 11 All-NBA selections (6x first-team, 5 time 2nd-team), 11 top 10 MVP finishes, has averaged 20+ points for 16 seasons, 25+ points for 15 straight seasons, 25/5/5 for 8 seasons, and has nearly 29K points. He’s also been to 4x Olympics and is on the verge of having 4 gold medals, along with being team USA’s all-time leading scorer by over 150 points.</p>

<p>How good is his longevity historically compared to other players?</p>

<p>The story of his life. 2nd best player his high school. 2nd pick in his NBA draft. 2nd in MVP voting 3 times.</p>

<p>Joined the dynasty Warriors team to win rings the easy way and still treated as their 2nd best player.</p>

<p>Big what-if as well - I think the Warriors would&rsquo;ve 3-peated had he not been injured. Joining that elite company would have made his perception a lot different in my opinion</p>

      <label for="lh1gjmr" class="commentText"><p>I always use the following as an example:</p>

<p>Imagine if, in 1996 after the 72-10 Bulls swept the Magic in the ECF, Shaq left the Magic and joined &hellip;.. the Bulls (instead of the Lakers). Would anyone give credit to Shaq for winning the next two titles?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why people dislike and discredit KD. A historically great team added a top 3 player to overload the team like crazy. But maybe people will be kinder over time. I can only speak for myself.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t give KD any credit for those two rings. He took the easy path to rings. The weakest move by a superstar in NBA history.</p>

      <label for="lh29zv4" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. The discourse around KD like he’s disrespected is absurd. He made the most  sorry move in league history and seems confused why he doesn’t get respect. Which is hilarious because before he made the Golden State move he was the most babied superstar in the league. Nothing in OKC was ever his fault</p>

<p>From a basketball standpoint he’s at his best when he can just go one on one. He’s not a leader, not a great passer and he’s not a great defender, he doesn’t handle double teams well. The idea of who KD should be and his efficiency numbers make people think KD ranks higher than he should. And it’s reasons like this why I hate stat watchers because it will have those people thinking KD is better all time than guys like Steph, Kobe or Larry Bird</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too, they went out of their way to recruit him, it isn&rsquo;t like he showed up at their doorstep asking to join and they said &ldquo;Yeah, i guess you can tag along&rdquo;. They absolutely needed him to win otherwise they were about to get sonned by LeBron for the next few years.</p>

<p>If KD had dragged the Nets to a title, he would&rsquo;ve had a lot less hate too, but he didn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a chance the &ldquo;Golden State couldn&rsquo;t win anymore without KD&rdquo; narrative would form eventually, but they won it all again so that died before it could.</p>

<p>No one would say that the Warriors were that much better than the Cavs because they had just split 1-1. KD shifts the narrative but the fact that 73 win team lost to LeBron helps KD’s case a lot here because they actually did need him to go over the top and even then it’s like damn that team still lost to the Raptors with injuries.</p>

<p>The 1996 Bulls is the greatest team of all-time, and by that point, Jordan was the consensus greatest player of all-time.</p>

<p>The NBA wasn’t even sold on the 2014-15 Warriors championship because every team they beat in the playoffs was hurt. When was the last time a team won a championship against an opponent missing their second and third best players?</p>

<p>2015-16 Warriors are grossly overrated. They lost just as many games in the playoffs as they did in the regular season. Their regular season dominance didn’t carry over into the spring, and Curry had back-to-back mediocre finals. Compared to Jordan, who never had a poor finals showing, nor did the 96 Bulls ever look that vulnerable.</p>

<p>The fact you’re even comparing the 2016 warriors who at the time had one championship which wasn’t even decorated to a dynasty that had already won three straight titles is so so stupid.</p>

<p>These are the types of people that talk like they know anything about basketball.</p>

<p>Your analogy is also wrong because the Warriors asked Durant to join them as well, but nowhere did you include Jordan/Pippen/Phil calling Shaq to join them. But that doesn’t fit your narrative.</p>

<p>His finals was mediocre. He didn’t get a single FMVP vote, and his numbers were down from the previous three rounds. Check yourself.</p>

<p>The following year, he was even worse. And using Draymond getting suspended as an excuse is crazy, when that’s on him. That’s not even a legit reason.</p>

<p>2016 Warriors lost. And 2015 won because the Cavs were hurt. You guys needed Durant. That’s fine. No shame. But let’s stop acting like he didn’t help create your dynasty. Your two rings without him are when the rest of the league is hurt.</p>

<p>I’ve never seen a team get more lucky. It’s pretty funny. I watched Kobe and Duncan win against each other at full strength, but the only time the warriors won a title against a comparable or healthy team was in 2022.</p>

<p>Just admit it, your path to your four championships was much easier than previous dynasties.</p>

<p>Magic and Bird had comparable teams, and had to play each other.</p>

<p>Kobe/Shaq had to play against the Duncan and the Spurs, and neither had the luxury of playing opponents with the other’s best players being hurt.</p>

<p>Your first championship was peanuts. Your loss to the Raptors without Klay and Durant is essentially what it was like when you won your first title, lmao.</p>

<p>Then in 2017 and 2018 the NBA had a new deal, and Curry was on a discount contract which allowed you to sign Durant. You didn’t even beat a comparable team apart from maybe the Rockets in 2018.</p>

<p>Im sorry I don’t consider Durant joining you guys that big a deal because you really needed him. It is what it is.</p>

      <label for="lh27o03" class="commentText"><p>Obviously not supposed to be taken in a vacuum but it the fact that the Warriors played much better when KD was out vs Steph was out will always make it look like Steph&rsquo;s team and rightfully so. They were 27-4 when Steph played and KD didnt while they were 23-17 when KD played and Steph didnt over that same stretch</p>

      <label for="lh308eg" class="commentText"><p>I see this argument so often in this sub and i can&rsquo;t actually believe yall on r/nba still use it as if it actually says something.</p>

<p>The Warriors were built around Steph&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses through YEARS of drafting and trades, their entire system was built with his playstyle in mind and they played around him, it&rsquo;s OBVIOUS that whenever he sat, the team would play significantly worse compared to when KD sat, this stat doesn&rsquo;t tell us literally anything.</p>

<p>Kevin Durant was the best player on the Warriors during his stint there, it was clear as day and NOBODY relevant ever questioned it. The entire debate at the time was if KD was closing the gap on LeBron, Steph was an afterthought.</p>

All time does is create more players your legacy has to compete with and recency bias basically always wins. Your grandkids will look at you like an idiot for suggesting KD was anything but a role player because rings and mvps become all that matters for players that you never personally watched.</p>

I was a KD defender once upon a time and then the Brooklyn/Phoenix stints happened and now it’s pretty tough to argue on his behalf. Great player but you can’t put him in that upper echelon. I’d say even the Giannis and Jokic careers will both age better.</p>

<p>Melo was a sensational scorer, but subpar to useless garbage in every other part of the game. Brought no leadership, hustle, and accountability, and was never interested in playing winning basketball. Gave zero fucks on defense, and was more interested in money and fame than winning games.</p>

<p>KD is Melo but bigger, plays the game the right way, and better to significantly better than Melo at everything basketball. Frankly, for team basketball, I&rsquo;m not sure there was anything Melo was better than KD at. Maybe dribbling?</p>

<p>KD is one of the easiest players in the NBA to build a championship contending team around, and he&rsquo;s arguably the best drop in player in NBA history because of how incredibly flexible he is offensively (i.e. great off ball or with the ball).</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a world in which KD leaves OKC in 2016 to join another team (e.g.Celtics or Wizards) and lead them to a ring. And we&rsquo;d be talking about him very differently. Or ofc he joins another team and is still ringless; he chose to get easy rings instead of earning them the hard way.</p>

<p>Variety of reasons. The Kyrie experiment was a predictable dumpster fire. And they were still KD&rsquo;s toe from going to the Finals (and likely winning) despite all the injuries and drama.</p>

<p>The Suns situation is wacky, but the Beal trade was kinda shit &hellip;. but maybe if they&rsquo;re all healthy and have some better fitting role players around them, they might turn it around&hellip;.</p>

<p>KD has been pretty damn good in his twilight years so far. But it&rsquo;s a team sport. It&rsquo;s hard to win.</p>

      <label for="lh2j3qt" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say Melo was better at rebounding and posting up, which was more relevant in an era with lower scoring and players could get away with being more physical in the post.</p>

<p>I think the original comment was comparing KD to Melo offensively, in which he called KD an elite version of Melo. But yeah he&rsquo;s lacking in all the other aspects.</p>

<p>Looking back I think he made the right choice, it&rsquo;s better to get easy rings and then try to win one on your own, instead of trying alone for years and potentially retiring without one.</p>

He&rsquo;s a good defender, a great shooter, and a capable ball handler and passer. He&rsquo;s an all-time iso scorer, but can also play within a system. </p>

      <label for="lh377zv" class="commentText"><p>That’s honestly a fair way to look at it and they were compared a lot early in Durants career until like 2013 or 2014 when KD started seeing more team success.</p>

<p>It’s more that a “pure scorer” like those two need more around them to actually win than a guy like LeBron. You need a primary defender, playmaker, paint presence and still need a secondary scorer like every team does. So it’s not necessarily his playstyle not meshing well as much as it’s that it’s a bit difficult to build a team around a guy whose only truly elite skill is scoring. The same was true with Melo but that doesn’t mean a team can’t do it, just that it’s harder than it is with a Jokic, LeBron, Luka, type of player.</p>

<p>Steph led in many advanced stats from 2016-17 to 2018-19 on the Warriors, and the Warriors offensive system was critically built around him. And hell, <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10037874-with-or-without-kevin-durant-stephen-curry-runs-the-warriors-show#:~:text=In%20each%20year%20of%20their,100%20possessions%20in%202018%2D19." target="_blank">Steph&rsquo;s on-off differential was higher than KD in each year of their partnership</a>.</p>

<p>KD is a generationally talented player, but he never won at the highest level without another alpha player on his team.</p>

<p>Curry did. Twice (almost thrice).</p>

<p>Not to take away from how incredible KD was, and just how dominant he&rsquo;s been in the playoffs for most of his career. And of course his offense got a lot better playing next to a defense breaking cheat code in Steph&hellip;.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not crazy to suggest Steph was still the best player on those teams.</p>

Not in terms of overall greatness (though there’s something there too), but just in that every year Drew Brees was playing, what he was doing was incredibly impressive for his age, but Tom Brady was two years older and doing things even more impressive, so it was easy to overlook. Had Tom Brady never been born, we would have been gushing at how high and consistent a level Brees was at so deep into his career, instead it didn’t really get mentioned.</p>

There’s never been anyone in the league close to his stature being able to do even half the things he does, puts up as many numbers as he wants. Levon did the SAME thing in Miami with joining a super team, yet KD was more accomplished when he did it with the warriors. When he’s healthy, even at this age and especially if he finds another team he fully meshes with, he’s the second if not the first player, highest efficiency option on the floor at any given time. I’m so tired of the KD hate because of his warriors stint. Yeah the team is stacked but so was brons, so was MJ, so was almost every winning championship team and their stars. There won’t ever be another KD. Wemby is a close second but he’s an entirely different role.</p>

      <label for="lh1yirb" class="commentText"><p>Kobe and Kevin Durant are two of my favorite players in NBA history. Their skill sets have helped develop my basketball skills throughout the years.</p>

<p>Looking back to the 2008 Redeem Team, Kobe instilled hard work ethic in this new generation of players LeBron, Melo, Wade, etc.</p>

<p>Then later on his career Kobe developed his post skill set training with Hakeem.</p>

<p>Kobe worked on developing the triple threat and helped develop players skill sets i.e. Kawai Leonard, Paul George, Demar DeRozan, Kyrie Irving, among so many other modern players.</p>

<p>Kevin Durant&rsquo;s height as well as agility allows him to pull up on anyone and being able to create the space as well as the handle to get to the rack. His selfless playing also shows great basketball IQ because he plays the game the right way and gets his teammates involved. Also he is underrated on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Seeing his adjustments and being able to create separation and spacing against players such as Wembenyama is remarkable to see.</p>

Melo/LeBron/Wade even talked about how the entire Redeem Team would go out to party, comeback at 5 am and meet Kobe in the hotel lobby going to the gym, something that eventually inspired them to follow him and go to the gym at 5 am.</p>

<p>You can even see that as a testament to their talent, as even though they weren&rsquo;t working as hard as they could, they were insanely great. Nobody is saying that they didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;work hard&rdquo; at all, but you can work hard for NBA standards and not work hard for Kobe Bryant&rsquo;s standards, in fact that happened more often than not, Kobe worked harder that 99.9% of players ever and was notorious for his inhuman work ethic.</p>

      <label for="lh2tc65" class="commentText"><p>How is it an load of crap when the players themselves said as much. Kobe shows them what it took to win as well as unprecedented work ethic that they had not seen before.</p>

<p>Just because they were all NBA players at the time does not mean they didn&rsquo;t have more to learn as the great players are always learning.</p>

<p>If they had nothing to learn why would players such as LeBron follow in Kobe&rsquo;s footsteps and work on post moves with Hakeem.</p>

<p>Your statement is ignorant.</p>

<p>Kobe took and made difficult shots. Not great efficiency, but not that affected by defensive attention</p>

<p>KD is actually very affected by how much defensive attention he faced. So he had some questionable series in OKC, looked like a God in GS, and had both in Brooklyn, depending on whether he had Harden</p>

      <label for="lh26erd" class="commentText"><p>Kobe is one of the few players that were able to stay with an single franchise for his entire career. Some of the teams he played on were clearly not very talented i.e. during the mid 2000s and later in his career so he would often face double or triple teams as even if he passed the ball out his teammates were unable to hit open shots.</p>

<p>Kobe has knocked down some of the highest degree of difficulty shots that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Kobe was one of the greatest one on one players in the history of basketball.</p>

<p>KD also is an incredible iso scorer. Russell Westbrook is one of my favorite players in the NBA however in the OKC years he would often put up more shots than KD which didn&rsquo;t work out that well in the playoffs. It has more to do with the lack of coaching and offensive planning with the OKC teams. An real coach would have addressed the shot selection and volume.</p>

<p>Of course with the amount of spacing from Steph and Klay in an motion offense KD had some of the best years in NBA history.</p>

<p>Harden is an overly ball dominate player with an bad attitude.</p>

<p>Kobe had his strengths and weaknesses. Elite floor raiser, not as good of a ceiling raiser since he lacked elite shooting, passing, or efficient.</p>

<p>KD with Harden gentlemen swept the Celtics with a historic offensive rating</p>

<p>KD without Harden got swept and had a dismal scoring series</p>

<p>There is an reason as to why KD won the finals MVP and not Draymond. Draymond is an overrated system player who set screens and got assists from passing to Steph, Klay, and KD.</p>

How can you say that Kobe wasn&rsquo;t an elite ceiling raiser when he won 5 championships. He also is the reason as to why the US Olympic team won Gold because he was the ceiling raiser for the young NBA stars at the time including LeBron, Carmello, and Wade etc.</p>

<p>Almost all of the great players in the last decade were all heavily influenced by Kobe.</p>

      <label for="lh1eniw" class="commentText"><p>I wonder if he can break into the top 5 of scoring all time before he retires&hellip;</p>

<p>Currently at 28,924 points. Assuming he averages 20 per game for 65 games a season, that&rsquo;s 1300 points a season. If he does that for 4 more seasons (he&rsquo;ll be 36 prior to this season so taking him to age 40) - that&rsquo;ll be 5200 points. That would bring him over 34K points, putting him #4 all time ahead of Kobe, MJ and Dirk.</p>

<p>Is that level of production reasonable up until he&rsquo;s 40? 20 PPG is low on the points side - he&rsquo;s averaged at least 25 every season excluding his rookie year. 65 games might be a bit of a reach (aside from last season, he&rsquo;s been injury prone since Brooklyn).</p>

<p>KD hasn’t averaged lower than 25 since his rookie year so I’m even being conservative on his projections. With the way sports science and technology has improved and how stars today have benefited from it with increased longevity, I don’t see why not.</p>

<p>KD since coming back from the Achilles is averaging 28.2 points on 53/41/89 shooting splits. KD himself says he will play as long as possible so it’s inevitable he reaches 40k should he avoid major injury. I think you will be surprised how many stars from this generation play at a high level into their late 30s due to the improvement of sports medicine and science.</p>

<p>Again, until this past season, he hadn&rsquo;t played over 55 games since he was with the Warriors. He just seems considerably less durable now than he was in the 2010s.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really conservative, it wouldn&rsquo;t be crazy to see his scoring drop in the next <strong>6 damn seasons</strong>, if he even makes it that far. 6 seasons is a long ass time.</p>

<p>Barring some crazy unexpected circumstances,  there is quite literally nothing to suggest that KD is not going to continue to age gracefully. He&rsquo;ll likely continue to be an all star level player for until at least Bron&rsquo;s current age.</p>

We all love to talk about how Lebron is special because of his longevity, but step is 36 still showing no signs of slowing down. kd is turning 36 soon as well, and James Harden is about to be 35. All of them are still playing at a high level at ages that used to be a sign someone’s career was ending soon. We’re going to see so many guys in their mid to late 30s contributing at a high level soon.</p>

A freak of nature with his talent/size but couldn’t will a team by himself as a leader. He should have won in OKC but too many egos and one ball. Jordan/Lebron/Kobe willed their teams to success. KD is just an assassin and should be able to last 5 more years. The game is easy to him.</p>
