    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>KD has played 16 seasons in the NBA, has 14 all-star selections, 11 All-NBA selections (6x first-team, 5 time 2nd-team), 11 top 10 MVP finishes, has averaged 20+ points for 16 seasons, 25+ points for 15 straight seasons, 25/5/5 for 8 seasons, and has nearly 29K points. He’s also been to 4x Olympics and is on the verge of having 4 gold medals, along with being team USA’s all-time leading scorer by over 150 points.</p>

<p>How good is his longevity historically compared to other players?</p>

<p>Big what-if as well - I think the Warriors would&rsquo;ve 3-peated had he not been injured. Joining that elite company would have made his perception a lot different in my opinion</p>

      <label for="lh1gjmr" class="commentText"><p>I always use the following as an example:</p>

<p>Imagine if, in 1996 after the 72-10 Bulls swept the Magic in the ECF, Shaq left the Magic and joined &hellip;.. the Bulls (instead of the Lakers). Would anyone give credit to Shaq for winning the next two titles?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why people dislike and discredit KD. A historically great team added a top 3 player to overload the team like crazy. But maybe people will be kinder over time. I can only speak for myself.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t give KD any credit for those two rings. He took the easy path to rings. The weakest move by a superstar in NBA history.</p>

<p>He ran from the team that drafted him to win with a team that won. If he came like Igoudala, before they won and was the final piece, it would be looked at totally differently imo.</p>

<p>If KD had dragged the Nets to a title, he would&rsquo;ve had a lot less hate too, but he didn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a chance the &ldquo;Golden State couldn&rsquo;t win anymore without KD&rdquo; narrative would form eventually, but they won it all again so that died before it could.</p>

      <label for="lh1vddk" class="commentText"><p>Your analogy isn’t remotely even the same, nor is it correct.</p>

<p>The 1996 Bulls is the greatest team of all-time, and by that point, Jordan was the consensus greatest player of all-time.</p>

<p>The NBA wasn’t even sold on the 2014-15 Warriors championship because every team they beat in the playoffs was hurt. When was the last time a team won a championship against an opponent missing their second and third best players?</p>

<p>2015-16 Warriors are grossly overrated. They lost just as many games in the playoffs as they did in the regular season. Their regular season dominance didn’t carry over into the spring, and Curry had back-to-back mediocre finals. Compared to Jordan, who never had a poor finals showing, nor did the 96 Bulls ever look that vulnerable.</p>

<p>The fact you’re even comparing the 2016 warriors who at the time had one championship which wasn’t even decorated to a dynasty that had already won three straight titles is so so stupid.</p>

<p>These are the types of people that talk like they know anything about basketball.</p>

<p>Your analogy is also wrong because the Warriors asked Durant to join them as well, but nowhere did you include Jordan/Pippen/Phil calling Shaq to join them. But that doesn’t fit your narrative.</p>

<p>Y’all be chatting shit.</p>

      <label for="lh1vp6z" class="commentText"><p>Reaaaaally disrespectful to compare Durant to Melo tbh lol.</p>

<p>Melo was a sensational scorer, but subpar to useless garbage in every other part of the game. Brought no leadership, hustle, and accountability, and was never interested in playing winning basketball. Gave zero fucks on defense, and was more interested in money and fame than winning games.</p>

<p>KD is Melo but bigger, plays the game the right way, and better to significantly better than Melo at everything basketball. Frankly, for team basketball, I&rsquo;m not sure there was anything Melo was better than KD at. Maybe dribbling?</p>

<p>KD is one of the easiest players in the NBA to build a championship contending team around, and he&rsquo;s arguably the best drop in player in NBA history because of how incredibly flexible he is offensively (i.e. great off ball or with the ball).</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a world in which KD leaves OKC in 2016 to join another team (e.g.Celtics or Wizards) and lead them to a ring. And we&rsquo;d be talking about him very differently. Or ofc he joins another team and is still ringless; he chose to get easy rings instead of earning them the hard way.</p>

      <label for="lh1n7gc" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not an unreasonable argument.</p>

<p>Steph led in many advanced stats from 2016-17 to 2018-19 on the Warriors, and the Warriors offensive system was critically built around him. And hell, <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10037874-with-or-without-kevin-durant-stephen-curry-runs-the-warriors-show#:~:text=In%20each%20year%20of%20their,100%20possessions%20in%202018%2D19." target="_blank">Steph&rsquo;s on-off differential was higher than KD in each year of their partnership</a>.</p>

<p>KD is a generationally talented player, but he never won at the highest level without another alpha player on his team.</p>

<p>Curry did. Twice (almost thrice).</p>

<p>Not to take away from how incredible KD was, and just how dominant he&rsquo;s been in the playoffs for most of his career. And of course his offense got a lot better playing next to a defense breaking cheat code in Steph&hellip;.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not crazy to suggest Steph was still the best player on those teams.</p>

      <label for="lh1uhgj" class="commentText"><p>Fuck that. In terms of skill and all around play he’s the single greatest player of all time. There’s never been anyone in the league close to his stature being able to do even half the things he does, puts up as many numbers as he wants. Levon did the SAME thing in Miami with joining a super team, yet KD was more accomplished when he did it with the warriors. When he’s healthy, even at this age and especially if he finds another team he fully meshes with, he’s the second if not the first player, highest efficiency option on the floor at any given time. I’m so tired of the KD hate because of his warriors stint. Yeah the team is stacked but so was brons, so was MJ, so was almost every winning championship team and their stars. There won’t ever be another KD. Wemby is a close second but he’s an entirely different role.</p>

      <label for="lh1eniw" class="commentText"><p>I wonder if he can break into the top 5 of scoring all time before he retires&hellip;</p>

<p>Currently at 28,924 points. Assuming he averages 20 per game for 65 games a season, that&rsquo;s 1300 points a season. If he does that for 4 more seasons (he&rsquo;ll be 36 prior to this season so taking him to age 40) - that&rsquo;ll be 5200 points. That would bring him over 34K points, putting him #4 all time ahead of Kobe, MJ and Dirk.</p>

<p>Is that level of production reasonable up until he&rsquo;s 40? 20 PPG is low on the points side - he&rsquo;s averaged at least 25 every season excluding his rookie year. 65 games might be a bit of a reach (aside from last season, he&rsquo;s been injury prone since Brooklyn).</p>

<p>KD hasn’t averaged lower than 25 since his rookie year so I’m even being conservative on his projections. With the way sports science and technology has improved and how stars today have benefited from it with increased longevity, I don’t see why not.</p>

<p>KD since coming back from the Achilles is averaging 28.2 points on 53/41/89 shooting splits. KD himself says he will play as long as possible so it’s inevitable he reaches 40k should he avoid major injury. I think you will be surprised how many stars from this generation play at a high level into their late 30s due to the improvement of sports medicine and science.</p>

<p>Again, until this past season, he hadn&rsquo;t played over 55 games since he was with the Warriors. He just seems considerably less durable now than he was in the 2010s.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really conservative, it wouldn&rsquo;t be crazy to see his scoring drop in the next <strong>6 damn seasons</strong>, if he even makes it that far. 6 seasons is a long ass time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m very comfortable predicting there&rsquo;s a 0% chance he&rsquo;s ever cracking 40k.</p>

      <label for="lh1q4l0" class="commentText"><p>Yeah he’s has not been as durable because two seasons in a row, someone fell onto his legs injuring his knees. His injuries aren’t chronic.</p>

<p>6 years from now he will still be 7 feet tall with a beautiful shot. That doesn’t go away. It’s more than likely he will hit 40k.</p>

<p>Don’t underestimate KD. As a Cavs fan you should know damn well how good he is.</p>

<p>RemindMe! 6 years.</p>

A freak of nature with his talent/size but couldn’t will a team by himself as a leader. He should have won in OKC but too many egos and one ball. Jordan/Lebron/Kobe willed their teams to success. KD is just an assassin and should be able to last 5 more years. The game is easy to him.</p>
