That he&rsquo;s not really known for his scoring yet is more than capable of doing it at the same level of the greatest scorers ever.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; can lag behind the numbers especially for monstrous outliers. Curry in college is similar, articles written about just how different his numbers are that might not jump off the page watching some games and casually checking the box scores.</p>

<p>He went 7th in the draft. I&rsquo;m not saying he should have been first, but there was more than enough evidence to know he had the ability to be a <em>literal</em> game-changing player.</p>

<p>People were aware he was a great player, he was a lottery pick, just like people were aware Jokic was a great player, All NBA 1st and 2nd team.  It is that they were both historically good in an obvious way that the general consensus was still quite far from.</p>

<p>Wolves though, that&rsquo;s rough buddy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also amazing that the draft was famously thought of as being exceptionally weak with no real clear All-Stars other than Blake, at least by general consensus.</p>

We have a much better sense now of all sorts of advanced statistics since Curry was picked and yet the draft can be and still is to a large extent a total crapshoot, because you can’t always rely on relative no-brainers like Wemby. That sort of player is a stark rarity for a reason.</p>

<p>There’s ultimately still a lot of guesswork and however you want to define hazy terms like intuition and intangibles here.</p>

      <label for="lnimco5" class="commentText"><p>And college doesn&rsquo;t always translate. See - Donovan Mitchell being projected as a defence first guard with limited offensive upside; KAT being &ldquo;NBA ready&rdquo; on defence but raw offensively, Draymond having offensive potential but no good position to put him defensively.</p>

<p>Draymond was supposed to be more of a scorer than KAT and Spida based on college. It seems like you look for potential more than production out of college, because college schemes are so incompatible with NBA or Euro-pro schemes. Not sure if it&rsquo;s because half the college game is selling graduated stars to potential recruits, but I suspect being a showcase league to an extent doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>The 2nd apron is such an anchor around your neck that the front office (and ownership) must have agreed it wasn’t worth getting into - even for KCP. Go back and look at our playoff run this past year and keep an eye on KCP. I love the dude, I’m seriously as big a fan of his as any Nuggets fan. But objectively his defense fell off in the playoffs, and by the end Braun was our best defender on the guards. Not to mention he was dealing with injuries, like his wrist injury, and his 3 point shooting also dropped off</p>

<p>They’ve looked at the situation and decided hamstringing themselves for years to come (I.e. the rest of Jokic’s peak) for an aging role player isn’t worth it, and they’re better off betting on the talent of their young guys they’ve drafted.</p>

<p>Now it still might not work out, but that’s just unfortunately how they have to play it in this new CBA. The 2nd apron doesn’t leave them many avenues</p>

<p>KCP probably helps us this year, even at his price and current level. But beyond that, would it end up hurting us more? The Nuggets felt like the answer was “yes,” and personally I won’t knock them for it before we even see how it turns out (and just be clear - even if it doesn’t work, that doesn’t necessarily mean keep KCP would have worked)</p>

      <label for="lnfwd7c" class="commentText"><p>My layman opinion is they improved their Timberwolves matchup, and made everything else worse</p>

<p>Why specifically the Wolves? They lost that series because Jokic had to play almost 48 minutes and was getting gassed. That was it. The team was completely lost without Jokic but Jokic couldn&rsquo;t handle ~48 minutes of play (and understandably so, this isn&rsquo;t a dig at him)</p>

<p>Enter Dario Saric. Is he Jokic? Hell fucking no. But he&rsquo;s a big man with great handles and passing who can play a Jokic-lite role, affording Jokic a little more rest. Hopefully, at least</p>

      <label for="lngay5l" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. If Jamal reinjured his knee and MPJ&rsquo;s back exploded just before the playoffs in 2023 and they were knocked out in the first round, he&rsquo;d still be just as good of a player as he currently is. The difference is most people wouldn&rsquo;t think so and he&rsquo;d be getting crapped on for a lot of stuff, unfair or not, like Embiid does.</p>

<p>Some regular season superstars that never get there in the playoffs were simply in the wrong situation and in a different timeline would have completely different &ldquo;legacies&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For all the shit Kevin Durant got for going to the Warriors there&rsquo;s no way in hell it hurt his legacy more than never winning a championship at all would have. Which is bullshit when trying to objectively look at how good someone was as a player (and that is not me saying Kevin Durant&rsquo;s legacy has been artificially inflated, I think it got him the recognition he already had more than earned).</p>

I think you have to go back to 2018 LeBron/2016 Steph/2000 Shaq to find a comparable offensive player this entire century.</p>

<p>Defense is harder to gauge, I think I&rsquo;ve settled on Jokic being very good vs certain lineups defensively and a matchup weaknesses vs others but never a truly bad defender, just potentially exploitable but nowhere near enough to dent his astronomical offensive impact.</p>

<p>This is just revisionist history. There&rsquo;s a staggering amount of threads you could look through over the years on reddit alone about that very topic.</p>

<p>I saw <em>many</em> with the literal argument of &ldquo;here are the numbers, here are the historical numbers, here is the context, he is so unbelievably good that anything you want to say about his defense doesn&rsquo;t matter because he is historically bonkers on offense(and also it&rsquo;s even debatable he&rsquo;s even <em>bad</em> defensively)&rdquo; and the response was &ldquo;this is how you can tell someone doesn&rsquo;t actually watch the games&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lnhmcz0" class="commentText"><p>There is still 1 thing that people don&rsquo;t give him credit for that stat nerds have noticed and that is his defense.</p>

<p>Before Jokic won his championship I made a thread that Jokic has similarities to Marc Gasol on defense and everyone critized me and said I was making a lazy comparison because they are both white and Steph Curry turned Jokic into a traffic cone in the playoffs. Removed because of mass downvotes you can see it here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/10bzh5j/does_jokics_defense_remind_anyone_else_of_marc/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/10bzh5j/does_jokics_defense_remind_anyone_else_of_marc/</a></p>

<p>Jokic is a huge advanced stat outlier on defense just like he is on offense but people say defensive stats suck despite him being super impressive in all of them year in and year out.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t rehash the whole thread but I started to look at things Jokic does do good on defense and he started to remind me more and more of Marc Gasol. Gasol was defensive MVP and I am not saying Jokic is as good as Gasol was but&hellip; Gasol did have Mike Conley and Tony Allen on his team so it covered for his weaknesses better than Jokic did. I find it hilarious Jokic gets blamed for Steph Curry being Steph Curry. Why does the big man get so much blame for not stopping the other teams superstar? Did Devin Booker get blame for not stoping Jokic? Did Luka Doncic get blame for not defending Jaylen Brown? I know centers are more important on defense but they get too much blame. We live in a world even Rudy Gobert&rsquo;s defense is critized, so of course what did I expect.</p>

<p>Anyway similarities with Marc Gasol that makes Jokic work on defense.</p>

<p>Both don&rsquo;t go for these giant leaping blocks and simply raise their hands up and dare defenders to shoot over their big bodies. Makes it so they both barely get fouls. Just like how fouling drastically makes an offensive player offense so much more effective (Doncic/Embiid/Harden) not fouling on defense makes the defender more effective. They both have great BBIQ and are great at knowing where to be and when. They can read defenders and both are amazing at swiping the ball and getting steals. If Jokic had Tony Allen and Mike Conley at his perimeter defenders instead of Jamal Murray (who actually isn&rsquo;t that bad) and MHJ (who is sometimes okay but mostly bad) I feel like Nuggets could field a top defense.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Regular Season Records:</p>

<ul>
<li>82 Free Throws Made in a Row, 3rd longest streak in NBA history (Also made 74 in a row later in the season)</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Playoff Records:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Highest FT% in a Finals Series All-Time: 97.8% (<sup>45</sup>&frasl;<sub>46</sub>)</p></li>

<li><p>Most FT made in Quarter, Playoff History: 13 (<sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>)</p></li>

<li><p>Most FT made in a Half, Playoff history: 19 (<sup>19</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub>)</p></li>

<li><p>Most FT made in a Game without a Miss, NBA history: <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub></p></li>

<li><p>Most FT made in a Game, Playoff History (modern era): 24 &ndash; (only better one was Cousy in &lsquo;53 with <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>, quadruple overtime game)</p></li>

<li><p>Highest TS% 40+ point game, NBA history, 2011 G1 WCF - 48 points on 92% True Shooting<br>
</p></li>

<li><p>4th Most Points scored in a Game, Conference Finals History - 48 (only Jordan&rsquo;s 55, Dirk&rsquo;s 50, and LeBron&rsquo;s 49 are higher)</p></li>

<li><p>Game 2, 2011 Finals &ndash; Scored 9 points in a row including the Game Winning layup with 3.6 seconds left</p></li>

<li><p>He made 39 straight Free Throws from Game 2 of the WCSF against the Lakers to Game 4 of the WCF against the Thunder. Finally missed one. Then made another 39 straight til Game 4 of the Finals against the Heat.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>77% TS in the clutch, 66 total clutch points over 16 games (11-5 record). (Jordan is the only player to put up more points in the clutch, scoring 76 points on just 56% TS and going 8-6.)</p></li>

<li><p>9.9 PPG average in the 4th Quarter of the 2011 Playoffs on 51/53/94 splits, the highest PPG in the 4th of any player since the NBA started tracking 4th quarter stats in 1997 (minimum 10 games)</p></li>

<li><p>10.3 PPG average in the 4th Quarter of the 2011 Finals (equaling LeBron and Wade combined). Dirk scored 62 points, Wade 44, LeBron 18.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve surely missed some, but this is a good overview. It was the greatest FT shooting and 4th quarter scoring run in playoff history.</p>

<p>Head to head against Dirk, I still think Dirk gets credit for the caliber of teams he defeated compared to Jokic.  Dirk beat the Kobe/Gasol Lakers that just won back-to-back, the Durant/Westbrook/Harden Thunder that went to the Finals the next year, and the Lebron Heat that won back-to-back starting the next year.</p>

They had made the finals 3 years in a row. They had easily played more games than any other team in the last three years. Boston got a break losing to Orlando. Dirk’s run was awesome, and I’m not saying the Lakers win if they hadn’t been playing in the finals every year, but that was a depleted lakers team.</p>

      <label for="lnfcupt" class="commentText"><p>Way stiffer competition, 3 55+ win teams, obviously the Heatles with LeBron, Wade and Bosh, the Lakers directly after winning back to back titles, and the KD/Westbrook/Harden Thunder the year before they made the finals. I think all of those teams were substantially tougher than anyone the Nuggets played.</p>

<p>Even their 1st round opponent, the Blazers with LMA were 48-34, which is a better record than anyone the Nuggets played. I won’t say the team was better though as the Lakers and Suns in 2023 were probably better than their record suggests</p>

He did a lot for basketball.  Tim Duncan was a master of the bank shot too. I respect them all.  I more don’t like just charging into players and throwing up a prayer.  I know it’s legal and I played with and against people that did it.  But to me it’s not good basketball.  I played a lot of soccer and it’s like flopping.  As a defender you can’t do that especially as a sweeper. So the advantage is all to them to dive.  I only had one red card in over 18 years of playing sweeper.  And it was because someone dove</p>

      <label for="lnfaaee" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Jokic is a better individual player than Dirk</p>

<p>Both are medium-high volume with great efficiency for their era scorers and close to neutral defenders so the biggest difference by far is the massive gap in playmaking</p>

<p>As amazing as 2011 was I feel like Dirk these days often gets ranked ahead of clearly better all around players(not just Jokic) just because of that one run and put in conversations that nobody was putting him in while he was active</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it at that before the Mavs fans come to swarm this comment lol</p>

      <label for="lnfav7k" class="commentText"><p>It may very well have been a better run as much as it pains me to say, but definitely gotta point out 2011 was still pre-the 3 point / scoring rise. Was probably tougher competition too. Plus Dirk was 33 in 2011, it wasnt his best / prime playoff numbers.</p>

      <label for="lnfeami" class="commentText"><p>It was a different time so it’s difficult to compare. The Thunder team Dirk played against in the WCF had an average defense by 2011 standards (105.9 defensive rating). That same defensive rating in 2023 would be easily the best in the league. And by the way that was the worst defense the Mavs faced in the playoffs</p>

<p>Looking at only qualifying players, in 2023 a 63% TS% would put you around 25th in the league, while in 2011, 61% would put you top 10</p>

<p>The Nuggets were the first seed they beat an 8th seed, a 45 win suns team, a 44 win lakers team and an 8th seeded Heat side they were the favourites from the start and won they didn’t face any great sides really.</p>

      <label for="lnfye70" class="commentText"><p>Don&rsquo;t forget early in his career with prime Wilson Chandler and Will Barton duo. And how Malone was benching him for Nurkic and playing him at PF position.</p>

<p>My favorite winner takes all (vs MIN with Jimmy in 2018) fortl the 8th seed, game where Malone played Wilson baby neck 48 minutes scoring 0 points going -5 for the whole game, those were the days.</p>

      <label for="lnfkl76" class="commentText"><p>I mean Jokic is MVP and Finals winning Celtics are more of a balanced team than team led by a single superstar (Tatum was the best player last season, but in the playoffs the team was much more balanced; though most series you could make decent arguments for like 3 people to win series MVP).  That said prior to the Finals, if you had to name a playoffs MVP it probably goes to Luka (even though he&rsquo;s a bit of a liability on defense).</p>

Jokic&rsquo;s size and strength is extremely overlooked, and his obvious flaws and lack of athleticism take the spotlight.</p>

<p>The other point I have in mind is also his endurance. He&rsquo;s part of every single offensive possession and his mind has to be racing all the time. It&rsquo;s not to excuse his defensive liabilities, but there&rsquo;s barely any player that had to be the offensive mastermind, finisher and orchestrator AND was 100% on defense (maybe obviously LeBron in his best years)</p>

<p>Now if you ask me I think it&rsquo;s also a joke to say he&rsquo;s Steph Curry from 3 based on his 3p% in a single playoff run, or to say that he&rsquo;s a KD-level scorer based on ppg in a single playoff run, or to say he&rsquo;s a Magic-level passer based on assists without accounting for the difference in pace/scoring, but those are all slightly less egregious than saying he&rsquo;s Giannis on defense based on a singular cherry-picked stat.</p>

<p>But he does steal ball quite often, at Olimpic Games in Paris he was the first in points, rebounds, assists as we as steals.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrong. The 1980 Lakers took more shots per game in the playoffs than the 2023 Nuggets.</li>
<li>If you adjust for the fact that Jokic took far more shots, the difference is even more drastic (with regard to teammate shots per game).</li>
<li>The real unfair part is that rookie Magic was used. 1985 Magic averaged 15.1 assists per game in a championship run. Even with fewer shots himself, he assisted a greater % of his teammate shots than Jokic.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>The year he picked KD he had a <em>lower</em> PPG average than his playoff career PPG average. Might have something to do with him sharing the scoring load with another all time scorer but let’s not address that Richard</p></li>

<li><p>He picked Magic’s rookie season to compare against (also wayy below his average for APG). Let’s also not address that Richard.</p></li>

<li><p>He picked Duncan’s 2nd NBA season to compare against. Why not pick the year he averaged 15.4 RPG Richard?</p></li>

<li><p>He compared Jokic 3PT% against Steph’s when Steph almost had 3x the volume lmfao</p></li>

<li><p>He compared Jokic defensive stats against Giannis. Richard is smart enough to know how much defensive stats (especially advanced stats) still have a lot of noise and are unreliable. Or idk maybe Richard doesn’t know I can’t tell. “He is Giannis on the defensive end” that should tell you everything you need to know about Richard’s arguments</p></li>

<li><p>And like you said these aren’t even normalized to per 100 possessions. Like cmon what are we doing here.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Jokic is an all timer. Jokic had an all time playoff run. We don’t have to make disingenuous points to prove that.</p>

<p>He chose Magic’s rookie season (without Kareem for some of it) instead of his 15apg seasons. </p>

<p>He chose Duncan’s second season when he was still in the double-big lineup with Robinson. </p>

<p> He used a KD season when he shared the floor with Steph, obviously scoring less. </p>

<p> Can’t even take the Giannis stat serious. </p>

<p>Jokics run was legendary and deserves to be talked about with the greats, but it was also, by seeding, the weakest slate of opponents in NBA history by far(8th, 4th, 7th, 8th). This stats-blown-out-of-proportion glazing is exactly why people get annoyed by some of the Jokic takes. </p>

<p>Steph took nearly 12 3-pointers per game and made over 5 per game against the celtics</p>

<p>Jokic took 4 3-pointers per game and only made 1.6 per game against the Heat</p>

<p>Steph made more 3&rsquo;s per game than Jokic even attempted. And that includes the game 5 where steph went 0-9 from 3</p>

<p>Jokic is 5-10 in the playoffs without Jamal, he says himself he needs him despite Nuggets and Jokic fans trying to say Jamal is a fraud. In the 2023 playoffs Jamal averaged 26 pts per game, that&rsquo;s tied with Barkley, Clyde Drexler and child rapist Karl Malone as the most points averaged in the playoffs by guys MJ faced in the Finals</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a teams 2nd option doing what superstar players have done and been called &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; their teams for doing, it&rsquo;s insane how little credit he gets for that ring still by media guys and fans</p>

<p>Seirously, you watch a Jokic game and you feel he is on another level</p>

<p>Stats cant measure IQ, but Jefferson could have mention that he had also more IQ than Lebron in that playoffs series</p>
