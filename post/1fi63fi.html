      <label for="lnf3jje" class="commentText"><p>This is what the stat nerds were shouting during his rise over the years about why what Jokic was doing was <em>different</em>. That he&rsquo;s not really known for his scoring yet is more than capable of doing it at the same level of the greatest scorers ever.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; can lag behind the numbers especially for monstrous outliers. Curry in college is similar, articles written about just how different his numbers are that might not jump off the page watching some games and casually checking the box scores.</p>

<p>He went 7th in the draft. I&rsquo;m not saying he should have been first, but there was more than enough evidence to know he had the ability to be a <em>literal</em> game-changing player.</p>

<p>People were aware he was a great player, he was a lottery pick, just like people were aware Jokic was a great player, All NBA 1st and 2nd team.  It is that they were both historically good in an obvious way that the general consensus was still quite far from.</p>

<p>Wolves though, that&rsquo;s rough buddy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also amazing that the draft was famously thought of as being exceptionally weak with no real clear All-Stars other than Blake, at least by general consensus.</p>

We have a much better sense now of all sorts of advanced statistics since Curry was picked and yet the draft can be and still is to a large extent a total crapshoot, because you can’t always rely on relative no-brainers like Wemby. That sort of player is a stark rarity for a reason.</p>

<p>There was sufficient data at the time to know Curry should be top 3 and it wasn&rsquo;t even <em>that</em> uncommon to think he should be top 5. There was more than a little chatter in the general media about the Knicks trading up from 8 to guarantee getting him.</p>

<p>This is a time when Thabeet went 2nd purely because &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t teach size&rdquo; and analytics writers online were being told that &ldquo;computers don&rsquo;t play basketball&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Of course we know now it was a spectacular fuck up not picking Steph much higher, in fact just outright #1 above Harden and certainly Blake (who let’s not forget had an all-time rookie season once he actually played), but advanced stats to some extent were still in their infancy then. TS% alone was just a few years old and even that still hadn’t quite supplanted traditional metrics then.</p>

<p>You know who else? Jeremy Lin. There were plenty of articles written while he was in college and even AFTER the NBA draft that statistically he was a great player and that it was specifically the fact that he was Asian or Asian-American that he was not regarded higher.</p>

I think you have to go back to 2018 LeBron/2016 Steph/2000 Shaq to find a comparable offensive player this entire century.</p>

<p>Defense is harder to gauge, I think I&rsquo;ve settled on Jokic being very good vs certain lineups defensively and a matchup weaknesses vs others but never a truly bad defender, just potentially exploitable but nowhere near enough to dent his astronomical offensive impact.</p>

<p>This is just revisionist history. There&rsquo;s a staggering amount of threads you could look through over the years on reddit alone about that very topic.</p>

<p>I saw <em>many</em> with the literal argument of &ldquo;here are the numbers, here are the historical numbers, here is the context, he is so unbelievably good that anything you want to say about his defense doesn&rsquo;t matter because he is historically bonkers on offense(and also it&rsquo;s even debatable he&rsquo;s even <em>bad</em> defensively)&rdquo; and the response was &ldquo;this is how you can tell someone doesn&rsquo;t actually watch the games&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lnfm0i7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m talking about me personally watching the games, not the general fan sentiment consensus lol. I don&rsquo;t give a single fuck about fan consensus or reddit comments, so I&rsquo;ll take your world for it. I think people who can&rsquo;t see the fact that Jokic creates open shots at an insane rate that other players minus prime LeBron and Steph can&rsquo;t, are frankly, like in reality denial mode or blind. Doesn&rsquo;t take a smart person to see these shots are insanely high quality.</p>

I think the original point was that lots of people don’t watch while it’s happening they’re just checking scores (why he said Curry’s college career was an example) but once you actually do see it (like people saw Curry in the tournament) you have people saying “well yea, his stats were outrageous what did you expect?”</p>

<p>Head to head against Dirk, I still think Dirk gets credit for the caliber of teams he defeated compared to Jokic.  Dirk beat the Kobe/Gasol Lakers that just won back-to-back, the Durant/Westbrook/Harden Thunder that went to the Finals the next year, and the Lebron Heat that won back-to-back starting the next year.</p>

      <label for="lnforsf" class="commentText"><p>It isn’t disingenuous at all, it’s an indisputable fact. He has never had a teammate be named an all star or to an all nba/all defensive team while they were his teammate. And it isn’t even like you could really make an argument that someone has been snubbed either (MAYBE KCP/AG for 2nd team all defense). Obviously Murray has had some extreme elevation in his play come the postseason, but he’s had just as many duds and is extremely inconsistent. Did he play like a star during that run? Yes. Is he a star? Depends on when you ask. I guarantee if you asked people now the answer would be a resounding no and this is only 1 year removed from that run.</p>

      <label for="lnfu9ik" class="commentText"><p>In 2018, Lebron also had all star Kyle korver in the finals vs the kd warriors. Sure that means Lebron literally had an all star teammate, but who would pick that version of korver over 2023 Murray? When trying to estimate a players impact, it makes no sense to me to equate so much continuos weight to a designation that only captures a moment. The most important thing is looking at actually how that player performed at the moment in question. Whether he made an all star team or not, Murray, just like jokic, played at an absurdly high level in 2023 playoffs, especially in that laker series. He averaged 33/6/5 on 65% Ts. Those are beyond all star numbers and trying to add credit to jokic by downplaying his teammates because they didn’t win some subjective awards is disingenuous. Again, jokic had an all time run which we can and should appreciate without denigrating how good his teammates were.</p>

They had made the finals 3 years in a row. They had easily played more games than any other team in the last three years. Boston got a break losing to Orlando. Dirk’s run was awesome, and I’m not saying the Lakers win if they hadn’t been playing in the finals every year, but that was a depleted lakers team.</p>

I think all of those teams were substantially tougher than anyone the Nuggets played.</p>

<p>Even their 1st round opponent, the Blazers with LMA were 48-34, which is a better record than anyone the Nuggets played. I won’t say the team was better though as the Lakers and Suns in 2023 were probably better than their record suggests</p>

      <label for="lnfaaee" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Jokic is a better individual player than Dirk</p>

<p>Both are medium-high volume with great efficiency for their era scorers and close to neutral defenders so the biggest difference by far is the massive gap in playmaking</p>

<p>As amazing as 2011 was I feel like Dirk these days often gets ranked ahead of clearly better all around players(not just Jokic) just because of that one run and put in conversations that nobody was putting him in while he was active</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it at that before the Mavs fans come to swarm this comment lol</p>

      <label for="lnfeami" class="commentText"><p>It was a different time so it’s difficult to compare. The Thunder team Dirk played against in the WCF had an average defense by 2011 standards (105.9 defensive rating). That same defensive rating in 2023 would be easily the best in the league. And by the way that was the worst defense the Mavs faced in the playoffs</p>

<p>Looking at only qualifying players, in 2023 a 63% TS% would put you around 25th in the league, while in 2011, 61% would put you top 10</p>

<p>Statistically for sure Jokic was the better player, and I think if you switch Jokic for Dirk on that Mavs team it’s hard to argue that they wouldn’t still be the Heatles top opponent. Especially if Lebron has a bad series still.</p>

<p>The Nuggets were the first seed they beat an 8th seed, a 45 win suns team, a 44 win lakers team and an 8th seeded Heat side they were the favourites from the start and won they didn’t face any great sides really.</p>

The only real argument for Jokic is if you only care about counting stats devoid of context. Lebron, Kawhi, KD, Steph, and Giannis all had greater title runs in that time frame.</p>

<p>Edit: Any slight criticism of Jokic gets you downvoted in this sub. Nobody has yet to actually put forth a substantive argument.</p>

That said prior to the Finals, if you had to name a playoffs MVP it probably goes to Luka (even though he&rsquo;s a bit of a liability on defense).</p>

Jokic&rsquo;s size and strength is extremely overlooked, and his obvious flaws and lack of athleticism take the spotlight.</p>

<p>The other point I have in mind is also his endurance. He&rsquo;s part of every single offensive possession and his mind has to be racing all the time. It&rsquo;s not to excuse his defensive liabilities, but there&rsquo;s barely any player that had to be the offensive mastermind, finisher and orchestrator AND was 100% on defense (maybe obviously LeBron in his best years)</p>

<p>Now if you ask me I think it&rsquo;s also a joke to say he&rsquo;s Steph Curry from 3 based on his 3p% in a single playoff run, or to say that he&rsquo;s a KD-level scorer based on ppg in a single playoff run, or to say he&rsquo;s a Magic-level passer based on assists without accounting for the difference in pace/scoring, but those are all slightly less egregious than saying he&rsquo;s Giannis on defense based on a singular cherry-picked stat.</p>

Jokic has good positioning on defense for rebounding and active hands, but he is almost a liability on switches and pick n roll situations cause he is so slow laterally. </p>

<p>But he does steal ball quite often, at Olimpic Games in Paris he was the first in points, rebounds, assists as we as steals.</p>

<p>So a decent defender, at least. And his strategy sense is good, he usually know what opposite team will play, how will they continue the action, so he can help the team.</p>

      <label for="lnfd9p1" class="commentText"><p>Do you think a 52 win Memphis team would&rsquo;ve been better? The 48 win Kings? Phoenix had Booker and KD and were favored in the series against the Nuggets. Lakers had Bron and AD, and beat that Memphis team. Those 2 teams were the strongest in the west that season, bar maybe a healthy clippers team. The first round series was the same team the Nuggets got knocked out by this year.</p>

<p>In the east you have an ever-failing sixers team, and an underwhelming Bucks. The Celtics were the best team from the East, but do you think a team, whose answer to Jokic would&rsquo;ve been Al Horford or Tatum, who struggles to take care of an overperforming Heat team, would stand a chance against what Jokic and the Nuggets were doing last year? The only teams competing with them are winning teams from previous seasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrong. The 1980 Lakers took more shots per game in the playoffs than the 2023 Nuggets.</li>
<li>If you adjust for the fact that Jokic took far more shots, the difference is even more drastic (with regard to teammate shots per game).</li>
<li>The real unfair part is that rookie Magic was used. 1985 Magic averaged 15.1 assists per game in a championship run. Even with fewer shots himself, he assisted a greater % of his teammate shots than Jokic.</li>
