      <label for="lnf3jje" class="commentText"><p>This is what the stat nerds were shouting during his rise over the years about why what Jokic was doing was <em>different</em>. That he&rsquo;s not really known for his scoring yet is more than capable of doing it at the same level of the greatest scorers ever.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; can lag behind the numbers especially for monstrous outliers. Curry in college is similar, articles written about just how different his numbers are that might not jump off the page watching some games and casually checking the box scores.</p>

<p>He went 7th in the draft. I&rsquo;m not saying he should have been first, but there was more than enough evidence to know he had the ability to be a <em>literal</em> game-changing player.</p>

<p>People were aware he was a great player, he was a lottery pick, just like people were aware Jokic was a great player, All NBA 1st and 2nd team.  It is that they were both historically good in an obvious way that the general consensus was still quite far from.</p>

<p>Wolves though, that&rsquo;s rough buddy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also amazing that the draft was famously thought of as being exceptionally weak with no real clear All-Stars other than Blake, at least by general consensus.</p>

We have a much better sense now of all sorts of advanced statistics since Curry was picked and yet the draft can be and still is to a large extent a total crapshoot, because you can’t always rely on relative no-brainers like Wemby. That sort of player is a stark rarity for a reason.</p>

<p>There’s ultimately still a lot of guesswork and however you want to define hazy terms like intuition and intangibles here.</p>

<p>There was sufficient data at the time to know Curry should be top 3 and it wasn&rsquo;t even <em>that</em> uncommon to think he should be top 5. There was more than a little chatter in the general media about the Knicks trading up from 8 to guarantee getting him.</p>

<p>This is a time when Thabeet went 2nd purely because &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t teach size&rdquo; and analytics writers online were being told that &ldquo;computers don&rsquo;t play basketball&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lnfi7uw" class="commentText"><p>The eye test doesn&rsquo;t lag behind for Jokic on offense when you see like the sheer volume of open shots the Nuggets get (and miss). I think you have to go back to 2018 LeBron/2016 Steph/2000 Shaq to find a comparable offensive player this entire century.</p>

<p>Defense is harder to gauge, I think I&rsquo;ve settled on Jokic being very good vs certain lineups defensively and a matchup weaknesses vs others but never a truly bad defender, just potentially exploitable but nowhere near enough to dent his astronomical offensive impact.</p>

<p>This is just revisionist history. There&rsquo;s a staggering amount of threads you could look through over the years on reddit alone about that very topic.</p>

<p>I saw <em>many</em> with the literal argument of &ldquo;here are the numbers, here are the historical numbers, here is the context, he is so unbelievably good that anything you want to say about his defense doesn&rsquo;t matter because he is historically bonkers on offense(and also it&rsquo;s even debatable he&rsquo;s even <em>bad</em> defensively)&rdquo; and the response was &ldquo;this is how you can tell someone doesn&rsquo;t actually watch the games&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Head to head against Dirk, I still think Dirk gets credit for the caliber of teams he defeated compared to Jokic.  Dirk beat the Kobe/Gasol Lakers that just won back-to-back, the Durant/Westbrook/Harden Thunder that went to the Finals the next year, and the Lebron Heat that won back-to-back starting the next year.</p>

They had made the finals 3 years in a row. They had easily played more games than any other team in the last three years. Boston got a break losing to Orlando. Dirk’s run was awesome, and I’m not saying the Lakers win if they hadn’t been playing in the finals every year, but that was a depleted lakers team.</p>

I think all of those teams were substantially tougher than anyone the Nuggets played.</p>

<p>Even their 1st round opponent, the Blazers with LMA were 48-34, which is a better record than anyone the Nuggets played. I won’t say the team was better though as the Lakers and Suns in 2023 were probably better than their record suggests</p>

      <label for="lnfgjhs" class="commentText"><p>Yea that was definitely one of the more impressive runs ever. Nobody came into those playoffs expecting the Mavs to win a championship lol. The nuggets were one of the favorites. 11 Mavs run and 95 Rockets run are the two most impressive in the last 40 years. </p>

Was probably tougher competition too. Plus Dirk was 33 in 2011, it wasnt his best / prime playoff numbers.</p>

      <label for="lnfaaee" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Jokic is a better individual player than Dirk</p>

<p>Both are medium-high volume with great efficiency for their era scorers and close to neutral defenders so the biggest difference by far is the massive gap in playmaking</p>

<p>As amazing as 2011 was I feel like Dirk these days often gets ranked ahead of clearly better all around players(not just Jokic) just because of that one run and put in conversations that nobody was putting him in while he was active</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it at that before the Mavs fans come to swarm this comment lol</p>

      <label for="lnfeami" class="commentText"><p>It was a different time so it’s difficult to compare. The Thunder team Dirk played against in the WCF had an average defense by 2011 standards (105.9 defensive rating). That same defensive rating in 2023 would be easily the best in the league. And by the way that was the worst defense the Mavs faced in the playoffs</p>

<p>Looking at only qualifying players, in 2023 a 63% TS% would put you around 25th in the league, while in 2011, 61% would put you top 10</p>

<p>Statistically for sure Jokic was the better player, and I think if you switch Jokic for Dirk on that Mavs team it’s hard to argue that they wouldn’t still be the Heatles top opponent. Especially if Lebron has a bad series still.</p>

<p>The Nets without Kyrie and Harden on one leg?
The Trae Young Atlanta Hawks?
The Suns were a good team but certainly not on the level that Steph, KD, Lebron saw.</p>

<p>Since 2022, I think teams have gotten better every year. People just look at team record and ignore the context that more parity makes the good teams records lower than normal. There’s also team like Lakers and Suns that Jokic played that made major major moves at the deadline.</p>

<p>EDIT: Even Kawhi the guy had an extremely talented roster and played the Warriors superteam without KD and Klay injured some games. That put guys like Alfonzo McKinnie and Quin Cook in positions to major contributors.</p>

<p>The Lakers weren&rsquo;t that good. They didn&rsquo;t have a well constructed roster and had nobody that could match Jokic&rsquo;s physicality. On top of that, LeBron was injured. The Suns only won two games because Booker went absolutely nuclear.</p>

<p>Hyperbolic statements like this are ridiculous.</p>

<p>The Nuggets beat a pretty bad Lakers team and then got embarrassed by blowing a 20-point lead in game 7 (something which had never happened before) at home.  Jokic had Ant looking like MJ cause of how awful a defender he is for a center.</p>

<p>Edit: Any slight criticism of Jokic gets you downvoted in this sub. Nobody has yet to actually put forth a substantive argument.</p>

<p>Are Mavs fans really guys that should be arguing this lol. Also i dunno if noticed it, but ANT wasnt exactly amazing in that series (had great and bad performances, but wasnt exactly a scoring machine for most of them).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As Mavs fans would love to point out when they didnt manage to even make the playoffs in 2023, its a team sport. Jokic had 34/19/7 in that game. Besides Jamal, nobody else on the team was even in double digits.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves shot double the free throws in game 7 compared to the Nuggets too, but nobody is gonna mention that shit.</p>

<p>Also i would have loved to have seen how well someone else actually played the Lakers cause i doubt theyd be shit talking them as much if another team played them.</p>

<p>And lastly since you mentioned Luka, he made Tatum look like prime Magic out there. Hell just Tatum himself was good enough to destroy the whole Mavs offense and defense and the man didnt even need to score to do so.</p>

<p>Hell they didnt even have KP and the Mavs still didnt stand a chance.</p>

<p>You wanna say Luka was injured, but like he is ever actually good on defense lol. Hell the Mavs have been getting destroyed by the Celtics all year long even with a healthy Luka.</p>

<p>Criticising Luka and the Mavs team for getting beaten by what is, by all objective metrics, one of the greatest teams to every exist is very comical. Bearing in mind that Jokic hasn&rsquo;t beaten a single 50-win team in his entire career in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Good enough to be a part of two elite defences that had entirely different schemes and personnel. As much as people want to criticize Luka&rsquo;s defence, in terms of actual on court effect, it&rsquo;s never that big of an issue. The Mavs were an elite defence once they got the starting lineup sorted out, and that carried on through 4 playoff series.</p>

<p>If you wanna call what the Mavs were doing in against the Clipers and Celtics elite defense then sure. Keep in mind that said Clipers team was so garbage that they were arguably the worst team in the wests playoffs and the Celtics destroyed the Mavs defense and offense. Shit wasnt close.</p>

<p>And as said before said team hasnt actually beat the Nuggets at all this year lol. I mena you can call them amazing or whatever, but in reality its the same team the Warriors beat in 2022 with Jrue instead of Smart cause you didnt actually play against it with its center.</p>

<p>But go on talk about how amazing the Celtics that were missing their starting center are.</p>

<p>Nowhere near as good as comeback as you think it is. You lost KCP and added Westbrook, yikes.</p>

<p>And you added the guys the Warriors, a team thats already lacking as hell on offense, benched. Yeah say what you want about Westbrook, but even he didnt go 0 for 10 in his last game of the season.</p>

<p>But nah you are right im sure Klay wont shoot that badly for the Mavs. Might shoot even worse though lol.</p>

<p>The mavs actually got to the finals. The Nuggets didn&rsquo;t even make it out of the second round. Trying to act like making history by being the only team to every blow a 20-point lead in game 7 is somehow better than making the finals wild. You know that you don&rsquo;t even belive what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I watched the finals man, trust me compared to how sus the Timberwolves series was with its refing, there was no question that the KP less Celtics was a tier above the Mavs. Cool you got to the finals, played like shit and didnt win.</p>

<p>Also you forget yourself here, the argument started cause you bitched at Jokic having the best performance of the playoffs, not Nuggets vs Mavs.</p>

<p>And if you look at their individual performances, Jokic was clearly better than Luka in these playoffs. If you think going 2 for 10 on 3s in game 7 is bad, try shooting 44% fg% over the whole playoffs and shooting 3.1 for 9.6 3s a game as a point guard. And let me not even get into his free throw shooting in the finals.</p>

<p>It quite literally was. They haven&rsquo;t even had a proper training camp together. It makes what they did incredibly impressive.</p>

<p>Once they got to Dallas, I wonder why.</p>

<p>Based on what? Jokic made history by blowing a 20-point lead in game 7, whereas Luka smoked that very same team, and gentlemen swept them.</p>

<p>Ant went <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> in game 7 for 16 points and didn’t do anything after the first 6-7 games of the playoffs.

<p>The only unfavourable matchup the Mavs got the entire playoffs was an all-time great team, that doesn&rsquo;t really say that much. The mavs would have smoked the Nuggets in the wcf if they managed to win in game 7 instead of blowing a 20-point lead.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also 100% true. My comment is proof of that, and it&rsquo;s a trend across this sub. Nobody talks about Jokic the same way they do about Luka, Tatum, Embiid, etc.</p>

Jokic&rsquo;s size and strength is extremely overlooked, and his obvious flaws and lack of athleticism take the spotlight.</p>

<p>The other point I have in mind is also his endurance. He&rsquo;s part of every single offensive possession and his mind has to be racing all the time. It&rsquo;s not to excuse his defensive liabilities, but there&rsquo;s barely any player that had to be the offensive mastermind, finisher and orchestrator AND was 100% on defense (maybe obviously LeBron in his best years)</p>

<p>Now if you ask me I think it&rsquo;s also a joke to say he&rsquo;s Steph Curry from 3 based on his 3p% in a single playoff run, or to say that he&rsquo;s a KD-level scorer based on ppg in a single playoff run, or to say he&rsquo;s a Magic-level passer based on assists without accounting for the difference in pace/scoring, but those are all slightly less egregious than saying he&rsquo;s Giannis on defense based on a singular cherry-picked stat.</p>

<p>But he does steal ball quite often, at Olimpic Games in Paris he was the first in points, rebounds, assists as we as steals.</p>

<p>So a decent defender, at least. And his strategy sense is good, he usually know what opposite team will play, how will they continue the action, so he can help the team.</p>

      <label for="lnfd9p1" class="commentText"><p>Do you think a 52 win Memphis team would&rsquo;ve been better? The 48 win Kings? Phoenix had Booker and KD and were favored in the series against the Nuggets. Lakers had Bron and AD, and beat that Memphis team. Those 2 teams were the strongest in the west that season, bar maybe a healthy clippers team. The first round series was the same team the Nuggets got knocked out by this year.</p>

<p>In the east you have an ever-failing sixers team, and an underwhelming Bucks. The Celtics were the best team from the East, but do you think a team, whose answer to Jokic would&rsquo;ve been Al Horford or Tatum, who struggles to take care of an overperforming Heat team, would stand a chance against what Jokic and the Nuggets were doing last year? The only teams competing with them are winning teams from previous seasons.</p>

      <label for="lnfhrx6" class="commentText"><p>I typed up a longer response to this but accidentally lost it smh, here’s a summary</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrong. The 1980 Lakers took more shots per game in the playoffs than the 2023 Nuggets.</li>
<li>If you adjust for the fact that Jokic took far more shots, the difference is even more drastic (with regard to teammate shots per game).</li>
<li>The real unfair part is that rookie Magic was used. 1985 Magic averaged 15.1 assists per game in a championship run. Even with fewer shots himself, he assisted a greater % of his teammate shots than Jokic.</li>
