<p>During the time they were playing, there was absolutely no narrative of Tim Duncan being a better player than Kobe.</p>

<p>For some reason it was post career and only here, this subreddit, that started this narrative (my guess is ulterior motive to his 03 trial)</p>

<p>Also I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned Kobe&rsquo;s 03 trial. Kobe&rsquo;s reputation was in the gutter, he did not finish top 14 in <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2005.html" target="_blank">2004 mvp voting</a>, yes behind PJ Brown. No one gonna pick Kobe before Duncan back then. Whether you think it&rsquo;s fair or not, off court issues do affect people opinion on a player. Kobe reputation slowly recovered after that.</p>

      <label for="lmr07aj" class="commentText"><p>totally understood why he didnt get the mvp votes.</p>

<p>Alvin gentry in 2008 - I think the best player in the game is Kobe, and I dont think its even close</p>

<p>Kevin Garnett in 2010 in middle of finals, post game, asked if Kobe is the best in the game- he replies “He is, period”</p>

<p>Jayson Tatum in 2022 - I have a hard time listening to people who dont put Kobe in their top 5</p>

<p>Kevin Durant in 2019 - Kobe is the true goat</p>

<p>you ever get any peers talking about Duncan like this?</p>

<p>02 03 was a really really good defensive team</p>

<p>Tim Duncan cannot deserve all the credit for that</p>

<p>the discussions were actually more about kobe and mj</p>

<p>Oh I love this one. No flairs and Kobestans love echoing this newly imagined timeline in their dainty little airheads.</p>

<p>The guy who won TWO MVPs B2B, who was top 5 in 8 straight years since his rookie season in MVP voting, top 10 in 12. And you alone think he was never considered a better player than Kobe Bryant?</p>

<p><strong>Pre season GM surveys</strong>. The first recorded survey is the &lsquo;02-&lsquo;03 season. I&rsquo;ll link till the end of Timmys prime the &lsquo;07 season to make this easy for you.</p>

<ol>

</ol>

<p>Oh and he was also ranked ahead of Kobe in &lsquo;08 as well. Hmm.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some highlights:</p>

<p>According to the GM surveys:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>&ldquo;If you were starting a franchise today and could sign any player in the NBA, who would it be?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/2VV4Tpj.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/2VV4Tpj.png</a></p>

<p>Bueller&hellip; Bueller?? Oh I mean Kobe??</p>

<p>Tim duncan was selected <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> seasons, placing first 3 times whilst also coming 2nd twice.</p>

<p>From 03 to 07 Kobe had two placements over the 5 year period. He did not get higher than 3rd place with an average of 2.8% of the vote.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/CDoIaWN.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/CDoIaWN.png</a></p>

<p>Tim Duncan won Best power forward vote 8 years straight (of recorded history since &lsquo;03) at an average of 64.375% During the first 5 years linked above it was 72%. He also was routinely second in best centres ranking as well.</p>

<p>With MVP selections even by &lsquo;08 Timmy was still above him in pre MVP selections (2nd to LeBron). Kobe was not selected first besides the &lsquo;03 preseason.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to say Timmy would&rsquo;ve won most if not all of these prior to 03 season as well if they had done GM survery before &lsquo;03.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Bill Simmons</strong> Page 2 NBA Trade Value column</p>

<p>Tim Duncan - No. 2 (2001), No. 3 (2002), No. 1 (2003), No. 2 (2004), No. 1 (2005), No. 3 (2006), No. 3 (2007)</p>

<p>Kobe - No. 3 (2001), No. 2 (2002), No. 3 (2003), No. 5 (2004), No. <strong>11</strong> (2005), No. 9 (2006), No. 10 (2007),</p>

<p>BS in 2002 - To Tim Duncan &hellip; the best all-around player in the league, bar none. Nobody &ndash; repeat, nobody &ndash; has a greater effect on his teammates.</p>

<p>Put it this way: I&rsquo;m not sure Bird and Magic would have enjoyed playing with Shaq, Kobe, Vince, T-Mac and everyone else &hellip; but they would have loved playing with Tim Duncan. Just a terrific player. I can&rsquo;t say enough about him. With Shaq seeming listless and overweight this season, the door might be open for Duncan and the Spurs next spring &hellip; just a tad ajar, if you get my drift.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Jeff Van Gundy</strong></p>

<p>(1999) “He’s obviously the best player in the NBA. Not just because of his skill level. I think it’s his maturity and knowledge of the game. You can just watch a guy play and know if he’s truly into winning or not. That guy’s truly into winning. To me, he’s not only the best player, but he’s somebody that obviously San Antonio is going to have for a long time and be able to build around because of his unselfishness.”</p>

<p><strong>Kareem Abdul Jabbar</strong></p>

<p>One of Magic’s teammates and five-time NBA MVP, Kareem Abdul Jabbar had a resoundingly positive review for Duncan. During an interview in 2016, Kareem was asked about his pick between Kobe and Duncan.</p>

<p>Mr. Abdul-Jabbar shocked the world by choosing Duncan.</p>

<p>“I think the best of this generation is Tim Duncan. He gets the job done, night in and night out. He’s versatile, totally able to do the things his team needs him to do to win. Nothing is lacking in his game.”</p>

<p><strong>Richard Jefferson</strong></p>

<p>“Kobe is not even better than Tim Duncan.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to go MJ one. LeBron two. Still counting though, still counting…. He’s got more years to get to that number one spot. At three I would go Kareem. Four I would go probably Tim, then five I would go Magic. Magic and Kobe are really, really close.”</p>

<p><strong>Michael Jordan, 1998</strong> Asked the question at a camp on who is the best and most talented basketball player in the world besides himself.</p>

<p>“Don’t Sleep on Tim Duncan, probably the most fundamental, all-around big man”</p>

<p><strong>LeBron James</strong></p>

<p>“Probably one of the best players to ever play the game of basketball. If I just look at the last 15 years, he’s probably been the most consistent, most dominant player that we’ve had as far as 15 years all together. He’s won (five) titles, multiple All-Stars, MVP, and so on and so on.”</p>

<p>Jerry West (1995) “the best player in the country and a No. 1 pick in the draft&hellip; if he leaves school after this season.”</p>

<p><strong>Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal</strong></p>

<p>“The Spurs won because of Tim Duncan, a guy I could never break. I could talk trash to Patrick Ewing, get in David Robinson&rsquo;s face, get a rise out of Alonzo Mourning, but when I went at Tim he&rsquo;d look at me like he was bored.”</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyone who says Tim Duncan is the GOAT, I won&rsquo;t disagree with him.&rdquo;</p>

<hr>

<p>These ones make me laugh.</p>

<p><strong>Greg Oden</strong></p>

<p>Greg Oden: “Everyone&rsquo;s been telling me that as a big man, no matter how much I prepare myself, you learn your toughest lesson when you go down to San Antonio. The other day [former NBA player and Blazers assistant coach] Monty Williams pulled me aside and told me: &ldquo;That guy down there&rdquo; &ndash; meaning Tim Duncan &ndash; &ldquo;has had surgery on his left knee. He can only jump about this high [holds his fingers about an inch apart]. He won&rsquo;t say a word to you, and he will Bust. Your. A&ndash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Kendrick Perkins</strong></p>

<p>About Tim Duncan &ldquo;He was the silent killer, he had hot sauce in his veins&rdquo;</p>

<hr>

<p>Doug Collins, Bill Walton and Bill Russell all said during broadcasts that Tim Duncan was the best player in the world. Magic Johnson said Tim Duncan was the best. Player. In. The. World during a series where Timmy was sharing a court with Shaq and Kobe even after their 3peat&hellip;</p>

<p>I gave you some examples from Players, GMs, Coaches, past All time greats, Pundits and betters.</p>

<p>There wasn’t a soul outside of Los Angeles that thought anybody other than Duncan was the best player in the world after winning back to back MVPs. No one who grew up before Kobe brought about the PR campaign to reverse his cred with &ldquo;black mamba and mamba mentality&rdquo; thought Kobe was the better player.</p>

<p>June, 1997 &ndash; Timmy&rsquo;s first public appearance in San Antonio &ldquo;I just hope you’re ready to win a lot of games&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim Duncan went on to win 1,158 regular season &amp; playoff games for the San Antonio Spurs.</p>

<p>But best of all?</p>

<p>Kobe&rsquo;s best was still below a Tim Duncan with one good leg. If you take away &lsquo;97-&lsquo;00, Timmy still put up a HOF better than Kobes in accolades and stats. It&rsquo;s truly incredible and awe inspiring.</p>

      <label for="lmqsr3v" class="commentText"><p>Tim Duncan was recently asked by Richard Jefferson a start, bench, cut question with Lebron James, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant.</p>

<p>He said he would start all 3 of them, and bench himself.</p>

      <label for="lmq9r58" class="commentText"><p>Spurs had an 8 point lead going into the 4th quarter and could have tied the series 2-2. But Kobe took over with some clutch shots and scored 12 points in the 4th quarter.</p>

<p>Spurs as a team only scored 10. Duncan went 0 for 2 and 3-6 at the free throw line to only have 3 points in the 4th quarter.</p>
