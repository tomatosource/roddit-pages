<p>“Anthony Davis is one of the two or three best defensive players in the NBA”</p>

<p>JJ Redick responds to @termineradio’s question about his decision to leave the #Lakers star center off his media All-Defensive ballot with @jumpshot8 and Ryan McDonough at #NBA2KSummerLeague</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically he said he had to: “factor in the stats, the advanced stats, and of course the team performance on defense. And he said in both years he heavily weighed the team performed defensively.</p>

<p>Kareem missed the playoffs in his prime. So did Kobe. And Steph. And KG. And Oscar Robertson. Luka missed the play-in IN BETWEEN CONFERENCE FINALS APPEARENCES.</p>

<p>The fuck more do you people need to understand that it is a team game and even the best players ever cannot single handedly guarantee a playoff appearance, let alone a top-10 offense or top-10 defense.</p>

<p>We have so many tools available nowadays to evaluate impact. Resorting “well his team ain’t that good so he can’t be that impactful” is just so lazy. It baffles me how some people can be so passionate about something so as to spend hours every day thinking/watching/talking about it and are still lazy enough to refuse to learn more about it…</p>

<p>And pretty much all of them are heavily skewed by the team performance, conference and division.</p>

<p>I kinda understand, where you are coming from, but it almost feels like you are trying to argue, that it is possible to objectively judge individual performance in a team sport, while that is just far from truth.</p>

I am a heat fan and so watch a lot of Adebayo. He carries Miami to a top 10 defense every single year.
They were 5th last season despite starting 3 subpar defenders and Jimmy, who only engages on that end every 3rd game.
I think Bam and AD are both in the convo for the best individual defender in the league, but it surprises me that AD was able to carry the Lakers to a top 10 defense.</p>

      <label for="ld7cpa9" class="commentText"><p>I take your point on Spo, but Miami does not play much zone with Bam on the floor.
The starting 5 almost always switch, the zone is really only leaned on during the playoffs to show different looks, etc, and when our backup bigs are on the court.
Hence, Miami ran a lot of zone two years ago with love/Zeller dropping and Caleb and Gabe at the top.
I haven&rsquo;t researched it, but I watch every single game, and I&rsquo;m pretty confident Bams time spent in a zone defense would be pretty low.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the stats show that the Heat use zone defense more than anyone else in the regular season</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s mostly when Bam&rsquo;s on the bench, that&rsquo;s clearly a BIG factor in the team&rsquo;s defensive rating overall IMO</p>

<p>No one is getting DPOY if they have to cover for everyone in the wings being blown by, losing their assignments or getting lost on every screen.</p>

<p>If your team is bottom 10 in defense then you aren&rsquo;t getting DPOY just as if you score 45ppg and win 25 games you aren&rsquo;t getting MVP</p>

<p>Either you are a floor general that barks orders and avoids lapses or every player is competent and you defend mostly your man and a pick here or there, I don&rsquo;t see a DPOY coming from a tanking team.</p>

There are no good individual metrics for defense, so no matter what if you are trying to make a statistical case it&rsquo;s including team performance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I agree with leaving AD off, but pretending like you can isolate individual performances in any objective or repeatable way from team performance is just stupid. I don&rsquo;t see any real problem with having a threshold for team success given that&rsquo;s extremely common for all NBA, MVP, and other awards that would qualify you for the supermax.</p>

I&rsquo;m a spurs fan and saw every game last season. Zach Collins was a traffic cone every dam time a defender was driving to the rim. Then you see the same guards try that on Wemby and nope out of the paint. Then you see Rudy get exposed in the playoffs because he had a defensive weakness. That&rsquo;s why I really don&rsquo;t like team record being the deciding factor for an individual award such as DPOY. It&rsquo;s not DTOY.</p>

<p>The “this guy is on a bad team so he’s not that good regardless of the numbers” is a lazy casual fan take, not a professional analyst take.</p>

      <label for="ld6ntjb" class="commentText"><p>Nah, the invidious awards should recognize the best players. But part of that recognition has to come with accompanied success of the team. Imagine if we just let some guy chuck god knows how many threes and he average some insane split. But we still land in the lottery. He shouldn’t even be in contention for an individual award because the context mattered. He could get away with that bullshit because we generally don’t care and suck ass on purpose. If you do that for offensive awards you need to carry it over to defensive ones too.</p>

It’s totally ok if a coach thinks that AD didn’t have a top-5 defensive season this year but thinks he was 6th or 7th. It’s not really socially cool to say you think another center around the league is slightly better.</p>

<p>Just gotta kind of accept whatever reddick is saying and not dig too much more into it. It’s just making it awkward for everyone</p>

<p>Yeah, plus he rarely had the toughest defensive assignments because his teammates typically took care of those. Most defensive possessions, he really didn&rsquo;t have to do all that much. I&rsquo;m sure that he&rsquo;s capable though, but it&rsquo;s odd to put him in that DPOY conversation when he clearly takes a backseat on defense in his team.</p>

If so if he believed Gobert and Wemby were better defenders that pushes AD down if he treats it as 2 guards 2 forwards and a center (vs 2 back court and 3 front court)</p>

<p>But Reddick was not consistent with this logic. If team defense is so important than Reddick should not have voted Wemby 2nd place for DPOTY given the Spurs low team defensive rating and crappy win record.</p>

<p>Reddick had a weird agenda against AD. He also angrily ranted on ESPN about how AD doesn&rsquo;t play games unless he&rsquo;s 100% healthy. I&rsquo;m sure Reddick and AD are going to get past it but its funny to see how wrong JJ has been on AD.</p>

<p>If team defense performance was an issue, Wemby shouldn’t have been on his ballots or DPOY as the spurs had a piss poor defensive performance. Comparing Wemby and AD, Wemby obviously had the better season but AD was the closest to total STOCKS to Wemby while also having the similar burden of anchoring a piss poor defense.</p>

If the pro analysts don’t know what the fuck they’re watching and have to resort to the same dumb “best player on the best team” kind of determinations as the casual fans then wtf is the point of them?</p>

But watch 1 game of every team which is a low bar, and tell me AD isn&rsquo;t a top 10 defensive player. He doesn&rsquo;t really have the excuse of not watching a Lakers game too since he was calling some games for ESPN.</p>

Thats what I hate about him he acts like advanced stats are end all be all. In basketball most of these man made advanced stats skew heavily depending on how they’re made. Also basketball doesn’t have stats for everything and it especially lacks it on the defensive end. Eye test and actually will tell you who’s better.</p>
