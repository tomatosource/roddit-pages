<p>To me, the separating factors are whether you have a &amp;gt; 20% Usage Rate, and whether or not you play starters&rsquo; minutes (&amp;gt; 24 MPG).</p>

<p>If you narrow it down to that criteria, I feel like you get a list of players whom most would consider stars or at least borderline ones.</p>

      <label for="l72iof5" class="commentText"><p>Good take. I think a lot of people consider the designation &ldquo;role player&rdquo; to be a marker of skill, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case at all. I think stars are the players that shape their teams&rsquo; identities through a combination of a unique skillset, high usage, and just generally being really good while role players are more plug and play and could theoretically be replaced by a player with a similar skillset without affecting the identity of the team. But its definitely possible to be worse at basketball and have more of an impact on their team&rsquo;s identity than a really good role player.</p>

<p>Like, if you replaced Klay with another 3&amp;D guy, the Warriors would still feel like the Warriors. They&rsquo;d be a lot worse because no one is as good at 3&amp;Ding as prime Klay, but they&rsquo;d still have their identity. But there&rsquo;s basically no one you could replace Steph with that wouldn&rsquo;t result in the whole team needing to overhaul their gameplan. Even if you replaced Steph with prime MJ or Bron, the Warriors would still be a very good team but they&rsquo;d have to play in a totally different way to maximize their star&rsquo;s skillsets.</p>

      <label for="l72f81c" class="commentText"><p>Positions in basketball are highly fluid, unlike other sports. Traditionally, that hasn&rsquo;t always been the case. 60 years ago, your best ball handler and passer was going to be your point guard. Your best post-up player was going to be your center, etc.</p>

<p>The role-player distinction just means that a player does not have the green light to do whatever they want on the floor. They have a defined role that they play and it fits neatly within the confines of their skillset. Whereas a star player has the green light and the trust of the coach to make more decisions and adjustments on the fly.</p>

      <label for="l72gw1u" class="commentText"><p>Most other sports don’t allow people as much ability to fill any role any time as basketball does when you combine the speed of action, limited court size, and restrictions on movement and ball handling. It’s like if you had a OLine guy line up as normal but then mid play switched to running back, threw a pass to the QB down the field who trips coughs up the ball for a defensive TD the other way. It doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Soccer has too large of a field for people to switch as much as they can in basketball and it has more players per side. Baseball (as has been pointed out) is one of the most technical games and while there are guys who are utility they have a much more defined role in the sport.</p>

In baseball, the positions are very rigid and skill-specific (you also can&rsquo;t switch on the fly). In Soccer (football) the field is huge and positioning the field follows a specific formation, even if it&rsquo;s fluid. Maybe Hockey? I don&rsquo;t know enough about the sport, but I would assume a guy who is intended primarily to be a defensive player can still get the puck, skate down the court, and take the shot.</p>

So you need ancillary players who can do a lot of other things.</p>

<p>In baseball everyone&rsquo;s just kind of in a fixed position and the ball is going where it&rsquo;s going and everyone gets mostly equal at bats so it&rsquo;s not really a topic.</p>

<p>In hockey it&rsquo;s the opposite of basketball where more importance is placed on depth</p>

      <label for="l72etrt" class="commentText"><p>Nature of the sport.  You kind of have to do a little bit of everything on the court in basketball, so roles are a bit less defined than in a sport like baseball.  Even a 3-point specialist or a defensive big man still have to play the other side of the court and do other things when they&rsquo;re in there.</p>

<p>Whereas baseball has a wide variety of specialists - lefty/righty relievers (and hitters), base stealers, utility fielders who can play multiple positions, defensive guys, designated hitters, etc, etc.  Not everyone in baseball is a star and you could call all these guys &ldquo;role players&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s easier to just use more accurate descriptions.  They&rsquo;ll often come into a game, do their one thing, and then sit back down.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t do that in baseball. Mike Trout has been trapped in Anahiem hell for a decade despite being the best player in our generation. You don&rsquo;t even really see that much in hockey, and you definitely don&rsquo;t see it in football.</p>

      <label for="l72h3ul" class="commentText"><p>The term role player is not a bad thing at all. I feel like in the past couple of years referring to a player as a role player used to be a diss. Not anymore tho tbh. About 3-4 role players on a good roster with a couple of stars is the key to winning a championship.</p>

      <label for="l72hso8" class="commentText"><p>What&rsquo;s wrong, boy? Other sports have very fixed and easily categorized roles. In baseball, the first baseman&rsquo;s going to do what every other first baseman does, so there&rsquo;s no need to find another classification for him. The same goes for positions in football. I could see the term making sense in hockey, but there isn&rsquo;t much to do in hockey.</p>

      <label for="l72j9h4" class="commentText"><p>Everyone in hockey is a role player - for offense it&rsquo;s based on the line you are on and what role that line is designed for. Top line, Checking line, 4th line - all play a part and get ice time base upon the role and then there are power play lines/units and penalty kill units - many times player are specialized as PK players.</p>

<p>Defense is based on pairings - and they each have the role in the pairing - one tends to be the offensive focus-puck carrier and the other the defensive/checking focused (works the corners) and each pair is put together for ice time.</p>

<p>It is so ingrained in the game that it just becomes the norm - and discussion around the game does take into play the role a player has - 1C, 2C center is always a hot debate. Same with puck carrying defensemen. Your pecking order/salary in the league is determined by the role you play. Players will leave a team because they are 3rd line and wnat 2nd line ice time/role - or 2Cs on one team looking for a 1C role. You&rsquo;ll see these discussions in the draft and during Free agency.</p>
