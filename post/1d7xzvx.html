      <label for="l72ez13" class="commentText"><p>Everybody and their mother has a different definition of role player, but to me, a role player means a non-star offensive player in terms of either usage or minutes played.</p>

<p>To me, the separating factors are whether you have a &amp;gt; 20% Usage Rate, and whether or not you play starters&rsquo; minutes (&amp;gt; 24 MPG).</p>

<p>If you narrow it down to that criteria, I feel like you get a list of players whom most would consider stars or at least borderline ones.</p>

The backup PG, the Boards And D guys. This is versus starters, who are the best available at their position originally, and have more than one tool so to speak.</p>

<p>But I think your interpretation is the current meaning, at least here online among the 11 million of us.</p>

      <label for="l72f81c" class="commentText"><p>Positions in basketball are highly fluid, unlike other sports. Traditionally, that hasn&rsquo;t always been the case. 60 years ago, your best ball handler and passer was going to be your point guard. Your best post-up player was going to be your center, etc.</p>

<p>The role-player distinction just means that a player does not have the green light to do whatever they want on the floor. They have a defined role that they play and it fits neatly within the confines of their skillset. Whereas a star player has the green light and the trust of the coach to make more decisions and adjustments on the fly.</p>

      <label for="l72gw1u" class="commentText"><p>Most other sports don’t allow people as much ability to fill any role any time as basketball does when you combine the speed of action, limited court size, and restrictions on movement and ball handling. It’s like if you had a OLine guy line up as normal but then mid play switched to running back, threw a pass to the QB down the field who trips coughs up the ball for a defensive TD the other way. It doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Soccer has too large of a field for people to switch as much as they can in basketball and it has more players per side. Baseball (as has been pointed out) is one of the most technical games and while there are guys who are utility they have a much more defined role in the sport.</p>

      <label for="l72e3sx" class="commentText"><p>In basketball there&rsquo;s only so much ball to go around so having star power is often superior to a balanced team of almost star players, since your concentrating it in the best players hands anyway. So you need ancillary players who can do a lot of other things.</p>

<p>In baseball everyone&rsquo;s just kind of in a fixed position and the ball is going where it&rsquo;s going and everyone gets mostly equal at bats so it&rsquo;s not really a topic.</p>

<p>In hockey it&rsquo;s the opposite of basketball where more importance is placed on depth</p>

      <label for="l72e85o" class="commentText"><p>yeah there are role players in other sports. Maybe called different things. Baseball has &ldquo;utility players&rdquo; they come off the bench in specific situations in the game. Also they have players that excel at one thing even if they are starters. Say they are good at defense, good at not striking out. etc.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get hung up on the term. What role players do (in terms of how they contribute to the team and how they can affect winning a game) exists in all major sports.</p>

      <label for="l72etrt" class="commentText"><p>Nature of the sport.  You kind of have to do a little bit of everything on the court in basketball, so roles are a bit less defined than in a sport like baseball.  Even a 3-point specialist or a defensive big man still have to play the other side of the court and do other things when they&rsquo;re in there.</p>

<p>Whereas baseball has a wide variety of specialists - lefty/righty relievers (and hitters), base stealers, utility fielders who can play multiple positions, defensive guys, designated hitters, etc, etc.  Not everyone in baseball is a star and you could call all these guys &ldquo;role players&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s easier to just use more accurate descriptions.  They&rsquo;ll often come into a game, do their one thing, and then sit back down.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t do that in baseball. Mike Trout has been trapped in Anahiem hell for a decade despite being the best player in our generation. You don&rsquo;t even really see that much in hockey, and you definitely don&rsquo;t see it in football.</p>
