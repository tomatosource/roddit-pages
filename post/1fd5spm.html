</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The 1991 Bulls lost two games in their championship run, a 2-point loss to the Sixers in the ECSF, and a 2-point loss in Game 1 of the 1991 NBA Finals.</p>

<p>The 1998 Bulls lost 6 games in the playoffs - 1 to the Hornets, 3 to the Pacers, 2 to the Jazz. Never by more than 3 points.</p>

<p>Even teams that destroyed the playoffs like the 83 Sixers, 2001 Lakers, and 2017 Warriors had bigger loss margins. To always be within one possession is insane - to do it twice is unbelievable.</p>

<p>1991 is super impressive because Jordan and Pippen had played all 82 games and had never made a title run before - to have that consistency in the playoffs is remarkable.</p>

<p>1998 is arguably even more impressive - to not have a single off night where you lose convincingly, when you are jaded from attempting to complete a 2nd three peat in 8 years, and in Jordan&rsquo;s case when you&rsquo;ve played all 82 games of the regular season yet again, incredible.</p>

Not to mention Thomas missed games in the prior series due to a bad foot sprain, so that was still hurting him against Chicago. Zeke was in <em>BAAAAAAD</em> shape when facing the Bulls in &lsquo;91.</p>

<p>NBA players are hurt pretty much always, it&rsquo;s such a nothing to be like &ldquo;he was hurt&rdquo; when he was playing and playing just fine. Pistons just got mopped by the Bulls, as did every team that year.</p>

      <label for="lmddb12" class="commentText"><p>Crazy thing is that the 1991 Bulls were much more an offensive specialist team than defensive.</p>

<p>Their team wasn&rsquo;t built to deal with the front court based offenses at the time at all. But still Horace, Pippen and Bill Cartwright were just absolutely DOGS in the front court. They&rsquo;re the most high effort squad to ever play IMO.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much they all struggled against them. Bulls would work Barkley and Ewing like no other, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s also a big reason why I have MJ over LBJ.</p>

<p>As amazingly talented and godly LBJ is, he does not maintain the same effort and focus. And I truly believe it cost him wins. And that it also gave MJ rings most players would&rsquo;ve lost.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m not talking about LBJ&rsquo;s consistent numbers.</p>

<p>Its His plays off, games off, and calculated approach to the game, whereas MJ always seemed to constantly sprint.</p>

      <label for="lmh4lk7" class="commentText"><p>I would say with the heat it&rsquo;s a lot about his defensive role drastically changing. When he joined the Cavs in 2015 yeah he started not putting as much effort in defense, which in hindsight was a very good idea as he can still go at top 15 level 10 years later. He probably understood that he could play much longer than anyone ever if he took care of his body and considering his career it was a fantastic choice. Also the current way the league is officiated makes it less detrimental too.</p>

<p>Lakers are awesome no doubt. But IMO outside of the Spurs, they didn&rsquo;t play anyone that good.</p>

<p>Bulls wiped prime Magic but post Kareem Lakers off the floor and ended the Bad Boys run in b2b series.</p>

<p>I am always amazing how how hard they play each and every possession. They do full court press for what feels like 40-48 minutes, it&rsquo;s wild.</p>

<p>They were the only super team in the league. They walked over the corpse of the Lakers in the finals with half a roster.</p>

<p>The East was a cakewalk compared to other seasons the Bulls faced. Everyone acting like the 91 Knicks was the famous 90s roster.</p>

      <label for="lme5u2r" class="commentText"><p>First threepeat team was hardly a superteam. They were just a regular great team with the GOAT and a great wing in Scottie. Team outside of those two was nothing special.</p>

<p>Horace, Big Bill, Paxton, BJ were the impactful players outside of that. That&rsquo;s your superteam? 2nd threepeat for sure. Stacked as heck. Which is why they were a whisker away from being B2B 70 win teams and were B2B2B 60 win teams.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We just saw the Celtics probably have the easiest championship run of all time.</p>

<p>But the 2017 and 2001 Lakers had an easier run. I just said that. First seeds will have a pretty easy run overall regardless.</p>

<p>But to call the 91 Lakers a corpse is just ridiculous, they were the 3rd best team in the league. They were a top 5 offensive AND defensive team, they won 58 games, including a 16 game win streak. They went up 3-1 on the 63 win Blazers. They were a great team.</p>

<p>They were busted up for Game 5 if that&rsquo;s what you mean. But the Bulls were just that far ahead of the Lakers, even as great as they were.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone mentioned the Knicks. I mentioned the Lakers and Pistons. These are better opponents than the Warriors and Lakers faced. With only the 17 Cavs being a team that got close/better.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re comparing the 91 run with the other 5 runs, I&rsquo;d say their 96 and 97 run were easier. 96 especially.</p>
