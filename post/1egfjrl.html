      <p>Obviously, we all agree transcendental players like Wilt, Magic, Larry, MJ, Shaq, Lebron, Kobe, etc will still be superstars in any era. Past or Future.</p>

<p>But most reasonable people agree that due to advancement of technology, Role players are better as time goes on. In this case, we are using 30 yrs gap.</p>

<p>Do you believe that 2020s Role players are better than 1990s Role players?</p>

<p>If yes, do you think in 2050, The role players will be better than current role players?</p>

<p>If yes,</p>

<p>Do you predict that the gap in talent will also get wider as time goes on. In terms of role players?</p>

      <label for="lfs1lea" class="commentText"><p>The guy&rsquo;s premise is flawed in the first place. Of course knowledge/training/nutrition are a huge part of why modern players are better, but a lot of it is also just population size. There are more people in the world than ever before and especially more people playing basketball.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. 40 years ago, there was no equivalent of Luka, Wemby, or Jokic because talent in those countries was never going to find basketball. The sport was not played. Gradually the game grew in popularity and we saw a trickle of Sabonis, Dirk, and Pau turn into more of a flood situation.</p>

<p>When Bron, KD, and Steph retire, we may have the first generation where Americans are not the majority of the league&rsquo;s superstars. That was beyond fathom in the days of Magic and Mike.</p>

<p>With bigger world populations and more people playing the game abroad, there are simply a lot more really good basketball players now than there ever have been before. Barring some type of global collapse or population decline, you would expect that to increase at a rate that exceeds the NBA&rsquo;s rate of expansion, meaning teams will only get stronger and stronger.</p>

Basketball is now getting more and more global, so there will be a much much much bigger talent pool. Hopefully the African countries well be richer and have more talented African kids having access to/can afford to nutrition, training, coaching and high level competition etc. Also with Jokic and Luka there will be more ex yugo kids falling love in basketball, those people are tall af.</p>

      <label for="lfrvdyl" class="commentText"><p>I think honestly the answer is no. If I had to guess I think the 70s-80s role players are only a decent bit behind the 2000s role players, at least in comparison to the 2020s role players who I think are pretty significantly better than the 90s ones simply for knowing that 3&amp;gt;2.</p>

<p>I would imagine that the growth rate of the skill of the game flattens for a while before spiking again when someone realizes another significant advancement in strategy similar to the 2010s enhancement of importance on the 3 ball.</p>

      <label for="lfs06ut" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t watch those eras, so I can&rsquo;t make too much of an argument here, but I agree to an extent.</p>

<p>I think offenses in general are more efficient and much harder to play against now, and to a certain degree I think the development of the 3 ball (especially with big men) has given role players the ability to impact the game on offense in ways that they wouldn&rsquo;t or even couldn&rsquo;t have before. And no question, that&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>

<p>But I think overall that&rsquo;s more of a shift in philosophy in terms of how the game is played, and while plenty of the guys from  yesteryear couldn&rsquo;t really make it in the league today given what the expected skillset is, I think it&rsquo;s a bit unfair to remove them from the context of their time and then be like, &ldquo;yeah these dudes aren&rsquo;t skilled&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a bit like describing people from centuries past that focused less on academics as inherently less intelligent.</p>

      <label for="lfs0m4r" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s the part I think kids don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>In 1990, power forwards and centers <strong>weren&rsquo;t allowed</strong> to shoot threes in most cases. The coach would literally yell at them if they tried.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that human biology simply evolved to make taller guys suddenly able to shoot, it&rsquo;s just that we went from discouraging them to encouraging them.</p>

<p>Fwiw I think the 1992 Bulls would absolutely destroy the 2024 Celtics.</p>
