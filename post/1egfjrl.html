      <p>Obviously, we all agree transcendental players like Wilt, Magic, Larry, MJ, Shaq, Lebron, Kobe, etc will still be superstars in any era. Past or Future.</p>

<p>But most reasonable people agree that due to advancement of technology, Role players are better as time goes on. In this case, we are using 30 yrs gap.</p>

<p>Do you believe that 2020s Role players are better than 1990s Role players?</p>

<p>If yes, do you think in 2050, The role players will be better than current role players?</p>

<p>If yes,</p>

<p>Do you predict that the gap in talent will also get wider as time goes on. In terms of role players?</p>

      <label for="lfs1lea" class="commentText"><p>The guy&rsquo;s premise is flawed in the first place. Of course knowledge/training/nutrition are a huge part of why modern players are better, but a lot of it is also just population size. There are more people in the world than ever before and especially more people playing basketball.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. 40 years ago, there was no equivalent of Luka, Wemby, or Jokic because talent in those countries was never going to find basketball. The sport was not played. Gradually the game grew in popularity and we saw a trickle of Sabonis, Dirk, and Pau turn into more of a flood situation.</p>

<p>When Bron, KD, and Steph retire, we may have the first generation where Americans are not the majority of the league&rsquo;s superstars. That was beyond fathom in the days of Magic and Mike.</p>

<p>With bigger world populations and more people playing the game abroad, there are simply a lot more really good basketball players now than there ever have been before. Barring some type of global collapse or population decline, you would expect that to increase at a rate that exceeds the NBA&rsquo;s rate of expansion, meaning teams will only get stronger and stronger.</p>

      <label for="lfs3ccf" class="commentText"><p>To break it down another way:</p>

<p>Let’s suppose that, in the population of the world, the % of people who are NBA caliber athletes is constant (this is a fair assumption assuming a normal distribution of athletic talent, which in a sample as large as the world population, is likely). We’ll call it 0.001% (which is likely an overestimate).</p>

<p>As the population of the world gets larger, so too does the raw number of people who are NBA caliber athletes. World population was ~2.6B men back in 1990 and is ~4B men today—in other words, ~26,000 NBA caliber athletes in the world back then, roughly ~40,000 NBA caliber athletes in the world now.</p>

<p>There are only 450 roster spots available in the NBA and have been for some time, which means in order to make it to the NBA, you can progressively get more selective with the larger talent pool. I do think that the outlier talents are such a small percentage that the ceiling there hasn’t changed much, but I do think the NBA’s “middle class” has absolutely gotten stronger in the last few decades, in large part due simply to cutting out more and more of the bottom-third of NBA caliber athletes because there are more athletes in that middle third available now.</p>

<p>And none of the above even accounts for the fact that the game has exploded internationally in the last 30 years, especially compared to the 90s.</p>

<p>TL;DR: the best of the best are so good and rare that you could take them into any era and they’d find success, but worst and mid-tier players in the NBA are better now than they were 30 years ago due to population growth and the international basketball popularity booms</p>

      <label for="lft3jvc" class="commentText"><p>This is the one, and some people in 2050 will undoubtedly use those changes to minimize any skills and accomplishments of players today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said this for a while now but if the league ever gets <em>really</em> serious about combating foul baiting, future generations will feast when it comes to critiquing and writing off players from the 2010s and 2020s.</p>

<p>With the current gen cherry-picking games in which Michael Jordan didn&rsquo;t use his left hand, imagine the footage next gens will pluck of James Harden diving into defenders and grabbing their arms en route to a 50-point night, teams fouling Andre Drummond repeatedly until he&rsquo;d shot 36 free throws in one game (&rdquo;<em>this</em> guy was an all-star in your era?!&ldquo;), and offensive players en masse being able to run roughshod over defenders. We&rsquo;re kind of just begging future critics to discount a lot of the accomplishments from this era. Even LeBron&rsquo;s longevity could be minimized by some (&ldquo;of course he could produce until he was 40, nobody was allowed to play defense&rdquo; could become a common refrain).</p>

<p>For all of us now, we can acknowledge issues we have with the modern game while still understanding and appreciating the skills of the modern player. Future generations, however, won&rsquo;t be so kind and forgiving.</p>

Basketball is now getting more and more global, so there will be a much much much bigger talent pool. Hopefully the African countries well be richer and have more talented African kids having access to/can afford to nutrition, training, coaching and high level competition etc. Also with Jokic and Luka there will be more ex yugo kids falling love in basketball, those people are tall af.</p>

If I had to guess I think the 70s-80s role players are only a decent bit behind the 2000s role players, at least in comparison to the 2020s role players who I think are pretty significantly better than the 90s ones simply for knowing that 3&amp;gt;2.</p>

<p>I would imagine that the growth rate of the skill of the game flattens for a while before spiking again when someone realizes another significant advancement in strategy similar to the 2010s enhancement of importance on the 3 ball.</p>

      <label for="lfs06ut" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t watch those eras, so I can&rsquo;t make too much of an argument here, but I agree to an extent.</p>

<p>I think offenses in general are more efficient and much harder to play against now, and to a certain degree I think the development of the 3 ball (especially with big men) has given role players the ability to impact the game on offense in ways that they wouldn&rsquo;t or even couldn&rsquo;t have before. And no question, that&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>

<p>But I think overall that&rsquo;s more of a shift in philosophy in terms of how the game is played, and while plenty of the guys from  yesteryear couldn&rsquo;t really make it in the league today given what the expected skillset is, I think it&rsquo;s a bit unfair to remove them from the context of their time and then be like, &ldquo;yeah these dudes aren&rsquo;t skilled&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a bit like describing people from centuries past that focused less on academics as inherently less intelligent.</p>

<p>In 1990, power forwards and centers <strong>weren&rsquo;t allowed</strong> to shoot threes in most cases. The coach would literally yell at them if they tried.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that human biology simply evolved to make taller guys suddenly able to shoot, it&rsquo;s just that we went from discouraging them to encouraging them.</p>

<p>Fwiw I think the 1992 Bulls would absolutely destroy the 2024 Celtics.</p>

<p>Role players are better as time goes on.</p>

<p>Is this true? Is _____, 2024 3&amp;D wing, “better” than ____, a 1994 undersized power forward?</p>

<p>Roles have gotten easier to see - 3&amp;D wing does his work on the perimeter - and they have changed <em>massively</em> as play style has evolved.</p>

<p>The role players battling Shaq and Hakeem and Yao are not the same role players battling LeBron and KD and Tatum.</p>

<p>Is Lu Dort better than Rick Mahorn? Interesting question!! Despite play style differences, they are very similar “role” players: tasked with a difficult defensive assignment and setting screens.</p>

<p>Generally, I will agree that the overall skill level of players has improved as training and analytics have evolved. ML Carr can’t out shoot Naji Marshall. But is Marshall a better defender, team and on-ball? Is Marshall “better”?</p>

<p>I don’t know, nephews.</p>

If the entire world plays basketball and we have like a few hundred million more people that want to be in the NBA, the talent pool is going to shoot up.

<p>Please, somebody name these average role players that are so much worse a decade or two later? Like, is Duncan Robinson this incredible modern role player? Naz Reid the best 6th man ever?</p>

<p>Like, Derek Fisher would be a near ideal 3andD guard in today&rsquo;s league and was never anything special in his time. Sam Perkins would be way more sought after. Bruce Bowen could stand up to any other 3andD today</p>

The list of injuries that could be defined as &ldquo;career-ending&rdquo;, &ldquo;career-altering&rdquo; and recovery times from injuries and sickness all become shorter. People should bounce back better and faster than they currently do.</p>

<p>A current example might be Derrick Rose, a guy who has spent the majority of his career as a role player but was literal MVP before devastating injuries. In 30 years would Greg Oden and Brandon Roy have healthy careers? Adding guys to the top bumps overall talent as a whole.</p>

<p>Many players who got worse from injury would likely not have dropped off as much. That applies to all caliber of players at that level.</p>

      <label for="lft9iud" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s a good question. Any number of things could happen, though. We&rsquo;ve had very little expansion over the last 20 years, but in the 20 years prior to that we had a ton. The NBA has risen in popularity and payroll, and there are more talented ballers available than ever, both locally and globally. So we&rsquo;re currently seeing a very heavily saturated talent pool.</p>

<p>But over the next 20 years we could see 5 new expansion teams. Who knows. That would mean 75 new roster spots in a league that currently only has like 450 (not including the 90 or so two-way contacts that would grow to like 105).</p>

<p>It also depends on philosophy. If balanced teams are finding all the success, the term role player would be redundant. People would be respected and paid well to come off the bench in a &ldquo;limited&rdquo; role. The game has been steadily evolving over its existence, with it being hardly recognizable from one generation to the next. In 20 years they might be wearing helmets and vr goggles where half court shots are worth 4 points.</p>

<p>Another variable is salary. If teams suddenly find themselves in a payroll crunch due to a downturn in the economy, players will suddenly not have as much leverage as they currently do. Teams will invest differently.</p>

<p>But if things largely stay the same, we get very few if any expansion teams, and the league continues to grow, something else could happen. I&rsquo;m intrigued at the thought of such a saturated talent pool leading to a new talent hierarchy. Imagine a top-5 player on every single team. Imagine a &ldquo;role&rdquo; player being a top-10 player by today&rsquo;s standards. Could be really interesting.</p>

      <label for="lfs6sk7" class="commentText"><p>Africa is huge, parts are getting there while other parts aren’t close. South Sudan is making noise in the olympics with a war going on and without any indoor courts.</p>

<p>Asia is also huge. And China is still extremely rural outside of the cities. The school and athletic systems also don’t exactly help with producing the best talent compared to the west. There’s still a lot of modernization to be done.</p>

<p>If we look at the worldwide growth since the 90s for basketball, it’s less growth than what is potentially possible in literally just Africa.</p>
