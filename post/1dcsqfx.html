<p>Kentucky also offered Hurley 8 years and $100 million. So it will be about fit and I’d be surprised if he takes an offer from a Lakers team that needs lots of work. That said, I’ve been surprised before and will be again. Just probably not about this.</p>

<p>This comment is inaccurate without actual context.</p>

<p>The salary cap was soft, but it existed. A team could go over the cap for its own players with Bird rights. But when over the cap, it couldn’t sign new players unless on an exception (like veterans earning minimum salary).</p>

<p>A couple years before Jordan was signed to his big contract in 1996, teams couldn’t go over the cap to sign their draft picks (long before the rookie salary scale). In 1994, 3rd pick Penny Hardaway only made <span class="math inline">\(1.2 million his rookie year because the Orlando Magic only had the cap space from trading Brian Williams (Later known as Bison Dele).  Hardaway made less than Bobby Hurley, the seventh pick during their rookie year. The team gave Hardaway a \)</span>20 million line of credit though.</p>

<p>Following the lock-out NBA got the player salary maximum and the luxury tax to discourage teams from exceeding the salary cap. But the basic cap works exactly the same way today that it worked in the 90s; teams can’t sign players if they are over the salary cap without the use of an exception; they have to trade players within a certain percentage of matching the salaries.</p>

      <label for="l83jzd0" class="commentText"><p>The contract started out decent at the time and pippen  was the one asking for long period.  As he had a back scare.</p>

<p>The point Reinsdorf was making was that if he went for a short contract, by the time the second contract was due, salaries around the league would have jumped and pippen would have made more that way. Jerry also said he would hold pippen to his longer contract</p>

<p>Pippen didn&rsquo;t listen, he wanted security.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like we know when the nba signs the new TV deal, money will jump [if cba didn&rsquo;t agree to smooth it]. Now imagine you know some TV deal would be signed causing money to jump, but not precisely when or how much</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what Reinsdorf was in situation</p>

      <label for="l818ayb" class="commentText"><p>Or the NBA in general?</p>

<p>Imagine if even 20% of his job is to get his guys to do better on fundamentals and losing some bad habits they might have picked up from AAU. Cleaning up their footwork. Making sure they don&rsquo;t carry. Playing defense correctly.</p>

<p>And then the NBA&rsquo;s Rule of Cool basically makes none of that relevant.</p>

<p>The reason why NBA coaches come from NBA teams or players is they know how the NBA works. The learning curve from college can be steep. We&rsquo;ve not had a ton of successful college coaches ever come over. They&rsquo;re comfortable in their field the position they have etc.</p>

<p>Also if the Lakers somehow drafted the next LeBron and he said, &ldquo;I want to play under a black coach&rdquo;. It really wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Hurley was 5 years into setting up his system and had a great track record. He&rsquo;d be fired.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest difference in the NBA. They players run the show. In College, the coaches do.</p>

Can you imagine what Lebron would do if Hurley just stepped on the court and pushed him in the middle of a play? Or what Giannis would do if Hurley started talking crap to him? The dude is extremely skilled but he has a giant ego and is definitely best in a system where everyone sees him as the mastermind. No way these lakers respect a fresh coach like that.</p>

There&rsquo;s less pressure and he&rsquo;d make more in the long-run.  The only reason he&rsquo;d go into coaching would be if it&rsquo;s a pure interest in coaching - and there have been better coaching opportunity offers for him before with Charlotte and Boston.</p>

<p>He’s good on paper with no real nba history. No one else wanted him. Ballmer could have thrown money at him but went with Ty lue. Dude isn’t as valuable as people think. He’s been playing with a stacked uconn squad who were heave favorites from day 1. That isn’t the same as coaching LA.</p>

That&rsquo;s a gig you take if you&rsquo;re already done and are looking to cash out, not if you are still loving the job and want to coach for another decade plus.</p>

He’s flourished already in the era of NIL and transfer portal, all he has to do is coast and be okay for a few years and his legend is cemented.</p>

<p>I thought it would’ve been really dumb to go pro too quickly while he’s literally on top of the CBB world with back to back titles.</p>

<p>Edit I know the 13 year olds here wouldn&rsquo;t know this but UConn, academically and athletically, was virtually unknown nationally before the basketball teams started getting good in the 90s. The newfound notoriety has improved the university drastically in that time frame. UConn athletics are the best thing that ever happened to the school and state. Anyone who comes from out of state and complains tuition is going to athletics wouldn&rsquo;t even be going here if it weren&rsquo;t for that spending.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an absolutely tremendous amount of money that&rsquo;s made in college sports, but it&rsquo;s seen very disproportionately by schools. In turn, parity at the D1 level requires ever-increasing budgets to keep up.</p>

<p>If the lakers were actually a serious organization (lol) they would have manned up and offered <span class="math inline">\(16-\)</span>18 million per, which would probably get him around $6-9 million per after taxes but before agent fees</p>

<p>Probably realized they can get somebody much more affordable than that because the ownership family is actually cash poor because all of their family wealth is from the lakers themselves </p>
