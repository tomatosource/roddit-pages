<p>Kentucky also offered Hurley 8 years and $100 million. So it will be about fit and I’d be surprised if he takes an offer from a Lakers team that needs lots of work. That said, I’ve been surprised before and will be again. Just probably not about this.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Pippen had already spent a decent amount of his rookie contract on his family and himself when it was time to negotiate.</p>

      <label for="l80n5qr" class="commentText"><p>You gotta consider that the year he signed it was Larry Bird&rsquo;s last year in the NBA after a freak back injury forced him into retirement. He guaranteed himself a decent paycheck for the long run. 1 year, 2.6 million would be worth about 6 million in today&rsquo;s money. That&rsquo;s enough (with extremely conservative estimates) to pay yourself about 60k a year, inflation adjusted, without touching the principal.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great if you want to survive for yourself alone, but what if you want to take care of your parents as well, now you gotta divide that in half, and would you really want to live on 30k a year as an NBA player? He had one child at the time, and would go on to have 7 more. Is that 60k per year going to take care of all them kids? Yeah he got underpaid, but he secured his entire family&rsquo;s financial future and if he had suffered a career ending injury in 1992, that contract would have looked like a genius move.</p>

      <label for="l80qajj" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but I&rsquo;m talking inflation-adjusted. If you get 3%, you have to get 6% returns to counter 3% inflation. I took 4% as baseline safe returns (that&rsquo;s roughly what treasury bonds will get you) and assumed 3% inflation, for a total net gain of 1% returns. It&rsquo;s not exact math, but it&rsquo;s close enough for estimates.</p>

<p>You can get 180k, but without adding that 120k back into the principal every year, your return will decrease over time with inflation.</p>

<p>Storrs is also a boring ass place to live, but extremely close to a ton of fun and/or nice places, some close enough to commute. For example he lives in Glastonbury which is a fucking nice ass town for wealthy families to live in and only something like a 45 min commute to UConn’s campus.</p>

<p>Glastonbury is also an hour and a half away from Providence or Newport, 2 hours from Boston, 2.5 from NYC, 3 hours from Portland Maine, 3ish hours to NJ where he grew up, 5 to Philly or DC or Burlington, etc etc.</p>

<p>University of Kentucky is near Louisville and Cincy, and then a few hours from Indy and Nasheville.</p>

<p>Not nearly the same selection.</p>

That&rsquo;s a gig you take if you&rsquo;re already done and are looking to cash out, not if you are still loving the job and want to coach for another decade plus.</p>

      <label for="l80psv2" class="commentText"><p>Balmer can pay for top executives and coaches. But the new salary cap rules are pretty restrictive and rich af owners can no longer just say fuck it and pay deep into the tax. I am convinced this is why Bob Meyers left the Warriors. He didn’t want to deal with the choices that needed making.</p>

<p>He’s a highly coveted coach, he can get into the NBA whenever he wants essentially, he wants to on his own terms. His first NBA head coaching gig being LeBron’s scapegoat and having to rework a struggling roster with high expectations is a recipe for disaster. Plus, the Lakers lowballed him.</p>

      <label for="l80nh85" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, probably not as much difference in Nba and Ncaam vs Nfl and ncaaf. College coaching in football sucks because the portal means you have to recruit your whole roster in addition to bringing in new guys, which is a tough ask for the size of a cfb team. Given player movement, its probably not that much different for a cbb coach in the portal era simce players seem to ignore their contracts anyways to force their way out regardless, and there is only 15 guys you have to keep locked in or fill spots for which is less insane, especially at a powerhouse program.</p>

<p>okay? Why the fuck are people expecting the Lakers to pay a coach with ZERO NBA experience a top 4 salary? Kentucky can spend that much because they&rsquo;re paying for one of the best college coaches, to coach college basketball, the Lakers would be paying that much for a gamble (yes I understand he&rsquo;s a great coach, but you don&rsquo;t know how he would be in the NBA).</p>

<p>This offer from the Lakers would put Hurley as the 5th highest paid coach, that&rsquo;s absolutely a fair offer for someone who hasn&rsquo;t coached in the NBA ever before.</p>

They decided to interview him, no one else, and know his options in CBB. If paying him ‘his’ market value, across all markets, doesn’t make sense they’ve wasted everyone’s time and made themselves look disorganised at best and cheap at worst.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t today&rsquo;s news make it obvious?</p>

<p>You can make the argument that it was a fair offer until you are blue in the face but what does &ldquo;fair&rdquo; have to do with anything? The Lakers wanted a coach. They made an offer. They failed to land him because it was too low. If they made a high enough offer, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to turn it down.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that there are plenty of coaches who would jump at the chance to be the Lakers coach for much less. Now you have no choice but to get one of them.</p>
