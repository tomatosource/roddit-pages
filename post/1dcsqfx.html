<p>Kentucky also offered Hurley 8 years and $100 million. So it will be about fit and I’d be surprised if he takes an offer from a Lakers team that needs lots of work. That said, I’ve been surprised before and will be again. Just probably not about this.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Pippen had already spent a decent amount of his rookie contract on his family and himself when it was time to negotiate.</p>

      <label for="l80n5qr" class="commentText"><p>You gotta consider that the year he signed it was Larry Bird&rsquo;s last year in the NBA after a freak back injury forced him into retirement. He guaranteed himself a decent paycheck for the long run. 1 year, 2.6 million would be worth about 6 million in today&rsquo;s money. That&rsquo;s enough (with extremely conservative estimates) to pay yourself about 60k a year, inflation adjusted, without touching the principal.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great if you want to survive for yourself alone, but what if you want to take care of your parents as well, now you gotta divide that in half, and would you really want to live on 30k a year as an NBA player? He had one child at the time, and would go on to have 7 more. Is that 60k per year going to take care of all them kids? Yeah he got underpaid, but he secured his entire family&rsquo;s financial future and if he had suffered a career ending injury in 1992, that contract would have looked like a genius move.</p>

      <label for="l80qajj" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but I&rsquo;m talking inflation-adjusted. If you get 3%, you have to get 6% returns to counter 3% inflation. I took 4% as baseline safe returns (that&rsquo;s roughly what treasury bonds will get you) and assumed 3% inflation, for a total net gain of 1% returns. It&rsquo;s not exact math, but it&rsquo;s close enough for estimates.</p>

<p>You can get 180k, but without adding that 120k back into the principal every year, your return will decrease over time with inflation.</p>

      <label for="l818ayb" class="commentText"><p>Or the NBA in general?</p>

<p>Imagine if even 20% of his job is to get his guys to do better on fundamentals and losing some bad habits they might have picked up from AAU. Cleaning up their footwork. Making sure they don&rsquo;t carry. Playing defense correctly.</p>

<p>And then the NBA&rsquo;s Rule of Cool basically makes none of that relevant.</p>

<p>The reason why NBA coaches come from NBA teams or players is they know how the NBA works. The learning curve from college can be steep. We&rsquo;ve not had a ton of successful college coaches ever come over. They&rsquo;re comfortable in their field the position they have etc.</p>

<p>Also if the Lakers somehow drafted the next LeBron and he said, &ldquo;I want to play under a black coach&rdquo;. It really wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Hurley was 5 years into setting up his system and had a great track record. He&rsquo;d be fired.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest difference in the NBA. They players run the show. In College, the coaches do.</p>

<p>He’s good on paper with no real nba history. No one else wanted him. Ballmer could have thrown money at him but went with Ty lue. Dude isn’t as valuable as people think. He’s been playing with a stacked uconn squad who were heave favorites from day 1. That isn’t the same as coaching LA.</p>

<p>I am not paying this guy more than Steve Kerr. You just can’t do that. This dude hasn’t proved shit in the nba. He’s a big fish in a small pond in the NCAA.</p>

But the new salary cap rules are pretty restrictive and rich af owners can no longer just say fuck it and pay deep into the tax. I am convinced this is why Bob Meyers left the Warriors. He didn’t want to deal with the choices that needed making.</p>

<p>He’s a highly coveted coach, he can get into the NBA whenever he wants essentially, he wants to on his own terms. His first NBA head coaching gig being LeBron’s scapegoat and having to rework a struggling roster with high expectations is a recipe for disaster. Plus, the Lakers lowballed him.</p>

College coaching in football sucks because the portal means you have to recruit your whole roster in addition to bringing in new guys, which is a tough ask for the size of a cfb team. Given player movement, its probably not that much different for a cbb coach in the portal era simce players seem to ignore their contracts anyways to force their way out regardless, and there is only 15 guys you have to keep locked in or fill spots for which is less insane, especially at a powerhouse program.</p>

<p>Edit I know the 13 year olds here wouldn&rsquo;t know this but UConn, academically and athletically, was virtually unknown nationally before the basketball teams started getting good in the 90s. The newfound notoriety has improved the university drastically in that time frame. UConn athletics are the best thing that ever happened to the school and state. Anyone who comes from out of state and complains tuition is going to athletics wouldn&rsquo;t even be going here if it weren&rsquo;t for that spending.</p>
