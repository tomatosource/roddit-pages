      <label for="lry8cy7" class="commentText"><p>Lebron got ripped for that move more than KD did for going to GS. That first year in Miami was one for the record books. They got booed damn near every arena. Everyone was dogging them to the point you had women in hair salons who didn’t usually care for “mens sports” that was talking shit about Lebron lol</p>

<p>And when they lost to Dallas?? Bro summer 2011 with the lockout was crazy. Lebron was getting meme’d crazy. Multiple YouTube videos slamming him, calling him all sorts of punks and pussies</p>

<p>They even wrote book about him called “the whore of Akron”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A native son of Akron, Ohio, LeBron James seemed like a miracle heaven-sent by God to transform Cleveland’s losing ways when he was drafted by the Cavaliers in 2003. But after seven years—and still no parade down Euclid Avenue—he left, announcing his move to South Beach on a nationally televised ESPN production with a sly title that echoed fifty years of misery. The Catch, The Drive, The Shot &hellip; The Decision.
Out of James’s treachery grew a monster. Scott Raab, a fifty-nine-year-old, 350-pound Jewish Santa Claus with a Chief Wahoo tattoo, would bear witness to LeBron’s every move, and in so doing would act as the eyes and ears of Cleveland itself. Crude but warmhearted, poetic but raving, hilarious, profane (and profound), The Whore of Akron is both a rabid fan’s indictment of a traitorous athlete and the story of Raab’s obsessive quest to reveal the “wee jewel-box” of LeBron James’s soul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.scottraab.com/youre-welcome-cleveland-1" target="_blank">The Whore of Akron</a></p>

<p>Ain’t nobody write no fucking book about no damn KD lmaoo. I feel like the difference is people who don’t watch basketball/sports couldn’t care any less that KD went to Golden State. In fact if you were rooting for a tanking team at the time or if you were team chaos, you didn’t care that he went to GS either and probably found it amusing cause of all the bullshit that would transpire after.</p>

<p><em>everybody</em> cared about LeBron going to Miami. I remember when they did Beat OKC in 2012, they flashed the cameras over to a bar in Ohio and everyone was looking depressed. The crowd stretched from the bar to the outside lmaooo</p>

<p>down 3-2 heading to boston, goes and gets 45/15/5</p>

<p>Obviously Wade&rsquo;s playoff success completely trounces Harden&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s tough cause Harden has like 5 seasons at an MVP level, while Wade really only has 1. Playoff success is more important than anything else, so yeah Wade</p>

<p>I think there are times in sports people expect perfection from athletes.</p>

<p>Also, should watch the clip of Mark Cuban getting onto Skip for calling LeBron a failure. Game plans work out, they had their system to nullify Bron and gamble on what the others will do, hoping they fail on plays.</p>

      <label for="lryx2it" class="commentText"><p>It adds to his story, but at the same time it’s only a “stain” because he’s competing with Michael Jordan for the GOAT debate. Tom Brady’s losses to the Giants are “stains” but then he went on to win 4 more SuperBowls and surpass Joe Montana’s rings by a LOT. So unless Lebron can somehow win 2-3 more rings, I think that it doesn’t work in the same way that it does for Brady</p>

      <label for="lryg8fr" class="commentText"><p>Nah, LeBron got ripped apart largely bc he dumped his hometown team on a self orchestrated TV special to announce he’s joining a super team in Miami. He would’ve gotten ripped apart regardless, but doing “The Decision” like he did just made the hate go up exponentially.</p>

<p>I would also argue that KD has gotten SIGNIFICANTLY more hate for going to GS than LeBron got for going to Miami. The LeBron hate fest was largely over by the time he was done in Miami, and was 100% done once he won that legendary championship with Cleveland.</p>

<p>If you want to say the intensity of the hate in the moment was greater for LeBron, you definitely have a point. With that said, KD still gets shit on for going to GSW. I would argue the collective amount of hate KD has gotten over the last 8+ years is more than what LeBron faced.</p>

<p>They’re <strong>VERY</strong> different situations, and KD’s is objectively worse since he joined the team that they just lost to in the WCF. KD doesn’t really have a shot at a redemption arc, so he’s kinda just stuck with this stain forever.</p>

      <label for="lrytq33" class="commentText"><p>Thank you for bringing The Decision up. I feel like every time a commentator or a podcaster talks about LeBron going to Miami leaves that out.</p>

<p>He made a spectacle of it. I remember when the special was announced my mom asked if he was gonna stay or go and I said he knows what Cleveland’s been thru, there’s no way he’d be so stupid as to rip their heart out on live tv.</p>

<p>Was the immediate reaction overblown? Sure, burning jerseys is crazy, but at the same time LeBron did himself zero favors by announcing he was taking his talents to south beach on national television.</p>

<p>People also forget that Ilgauskas also went to Miami, and he was actually cheered when they came back to Cleveland. Know why? Because he was classy about it and took a full page out of the Plain Dealer thanking the city. The tiniest bit of grace from LeBron would’ve gone a long way.</p>

<p>And yeah, I’m totally over it. God I feel like I’m 14 again</p>

      <label for="ls00ynk" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>If we are just talking about moves, KD to GSW is way worse than Lebron to Heat.</p>

<p>But that &lsquo;The decision&rsquo; thing is just absolutely cruel to Cavs fans. I mean, I can appreciate Lebron now but I would still say this is the biggest mistake of his career, and would forever taint his legacy. But young kids do dumb stuff. It&rsquo;s alright.</p>

I remember that whole era cause I was one of the many hating. I also remember the reaction to KD’s decision. KD’s decision was really only relevant in the sports landscape but I swear everybody really was on Lebron’s ass in 2010. There were people I didn’t know watched ball that were on twitter calling him Lebitch and Letraitor. KD’s situation only drew maybe half the hate especially since the warriors went on to win. LeBron doing all of that just to choke in 2011 was truly a moment in sports history. Everything LeBron has done to since will never change that.</p>

Then there was the not one, not two, not… press conference.  I loved Lebron when he came into the league,  but the whole taking his talents to South Beach really turned me off of him.</p>

<p>Plus as great as Durant is, he isn’t in the goat discussion.  The greatest player of this century abandoning his team in his prime isn’t something we have seen often.</p>

      <label for="lrysf5m" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll agree with you in terms of sheer volume, but in terms of legacy and duration most people don&rsquo;t really give much of a fuck anymore and I feel like you&rsquo;re kinda doing revisionist history in terms of just how hated the Durant to warriors thing is JUST to try and prop up what happened to Bron. People thought LeBron was a traitor and did a weak move. People were legitimately saying shit like &ldquo;The Warriors ruined basketball&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But the sheer level of hate for Miami was absurd and kinda funny in hindsight. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever get a book about KD but even to this day people still hate Durant for the move whereas 5 years after Bron did his move after winning in Cleveland nobody gave a fuck.</p>

<p>Even now if you express the opinion that Teague had (ie; Durant&rsquo;s move was worse but that it was basically just Bron&rsquo;s move on steroids) you&rsquo;ll get people typing until their fingers fall off about how it wasn&rsquo;t the same and even comparing them is ridiculous.</p>

<p>And you know what? I’m ok rewarding him for that. He earned the fuck out of his rewards tbh. Plus, his particular flavor of psychosis is relatively non toxic.</p>

<p>I will just always point out that there ARE all-time greats who seem to be genuinely cool and not psycho freaks. Hakeem and Kareem are often my go-to examples, but I know there are others.</p>

      <label for="ls2jeu8" class="commentText"><p>As a lifelong LeBron fan, I will always argue that Danny Ferry simply wasn&rsquo;t doing enough to get LeBron a strong enough supporting cast for the playoffs and Mike Brown was consistently out coached in match ups.</p>

<p>Take the Celtics series;</p>

<p>Several times we saw the Celtics struggle with the Big Z, JJ Hickson line up throughout the season, but instead Brown would roll Shaq&rsquo;s 450lb fat ass out onto the floor causing spacing issues for LeBron&rsquo;s drive and kick game.</p>

<p>Antawn Jamison couldn&rsquo;t guard a traffic cone in that series and JJ had been regulated to the bench after starting 73 games for the Cavs in the regular season. It was no surprise that the Cavs went on runs in that series whenever he had those two in the game with Bron.</p>

<p>Pat Riley simply sold him the dream of &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve won championships before, we can do it again&rdquo; after Bron was being told &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not good enough&rdquo; by the 24 hour sports media cycle.</p>

<p>He also made the decision on national T.V at 25 years old.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t even explain how dumb I was at 25 years old. I can&rsquo;t even explain how dumb I am now, but I can definitely tell you that whilst I still think it was stupid, I could understand.</p>

Im a New Yorker who has been to Cali like 3 months out of my life. The impact of one player on the court makes it easier for fans to get behind a great player instead of a great franchise. Especially when some of these franchises have shit front offices that we can see.</p>

<p>Cleveland didn&rsquo;t deserve nor appreciate LeBron, so it always felt like it was bound to happen. I guess some people had hopes that Cleveland will invest money and build team around LeBron, but that didn&rsquo;t happen and rest is history.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect Heat to become &ldquo;this&rdquo;&hellip;.but honestly It was fun to watch and it was exactly what we needed after Boston shenanigans.</p>

<p>But yeah&hellip; I think after coming back and winning the tittle with Cleveland. Just imagine if Westbrook or Durant came back to OKC to lead the team to win the tittle. LeBron is crazy for achieving this.</p>

<p>But I also respect that LeBron carried that Cavs team ridiculously hard until he hit free agency, knew his org couldn’t build a championship team, and had already been hearing the “he needs a ring” chatter for most of the career. I also just generally understand the appeal of playing with other elite level players - especially after the Olympics, at a point in your career where your best NBA teammate was Mo Williams.</p>

<p>You can try to justify this as much as you like because you like LeBron more the KD but as Charles Barkley said, the concept is the same behind both moves. It’s to stack the deck so much you cannot not win a championship from it.</p>

Running the trio of post prime Scottie with washed up Chuck and Hakeem was not a super team and they all knew it.  Scottie was scoring under 15 a game by then though he was still a good defender, Chuck and Hakeem were at 16 and 19.  That big 3 was scoring fewer than 50 a game.  Lebron and DWade alone scored over 50, and they were two of the best players in the league in their primes.  Scottie, Chuck, and Hakeem were 33, 35, and 36.  LeBron, DWade, and Bosh were 26, 29 and 26.  All of that being said, KD was still a bigger bitch move and I wish the Warriors hadn’t done it.</p>

<p>Lebron was out here coordinating pay cuts with other players and their agents, getting assurances that he was going to have all-nba teammates before signing with a team in free agency, getting 50-win coaches fired etc. He&rsquo;s exercised power and influence in a way that no player ever has.</p>

<p>At least he, at the minimum, ran down his contracts and not ask for trade/not play until a situation was resolved. It is an ass move but his career he always gave 100% and committed to the contracts he signed. He just liked to have control of his future which I think is fine.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty fundamentally different from how the Heatles came together through player coordination and free agency. Bron and Bosh were both 26 as well with Wade being in the middle of his prime so the ages are also different compared to the tail end of prime trio in Boston.</p>

<p>and 2012 - bosh injured, wade&rsquo;s getting benched and arguing with spo, lebron goes and gets 40/18/9, wade gets his knees drained, is good for 5 games, literally, and then back to like 80% of wade, lebron goes and gets 45/15/5</p>

<p>2013 - i&rsquo;m convinced of either 2 things. 1. you&rsquo;re all gaslighting me, 2. some of yall were just not alive to watch it. because wade&rsquo;s knees were DONE, i don&rsquo;t blame him at all, it&rsquo;s all about health, but that was a one man show + defense + just smart vets, it was not a oh we have 2 top 5 guys and we&rsquo;re just dominating l</p>

He would then injure his knee during that streak, which was near the end of the season, and never be the same again. His playoffs were horrible he averaged 16 points on 45/25/75 in 2013 and it would go downhill from there</p>

The &ldquo;best player in the league teaming up with his buddies because he can&rsquo;t win with the team that was given&rdquo; will always be an argument used against Lebron in GOAT debates. Ring chasing has always been a thing but it&rsquo;s incredibly rare for the best player in the league to ring chase this obviously. Lebron&rsquo;s return to Cleveland obviously meant he had a high level of organizational control and brought about the &ldquo;LeGM&rdquo; memes that are still enduring today.</p>

      <label for="lrz3zfd" class="commentText"><p>The problem is that the narrative has shifted, thanks to his stans, to the point where the suggestion is that he was absolutely justified in doing that because &lsquo;the Cavs were trash and he had no help&rsquo;.<br>
All you need to do is a little research to see how laughably dumb that narrative is. In both 2009 &amp; 2010 the Cavs had the <em>best record in the entire league.</em> They were literally the best team in the NBA in successive seasons winning 60+ games both times with a 66 win season in 2009. Any team capable of winning that many games is absolutely elite. Sometimes a team with just one superstar is enough because the rest of the team play their particular roles perfectly to complement their star. You don&rsquo;t need a big three or multiple All Stars to succeed. Ironically, LeBron is probably to blame for this myth. His success has come via superteams and, as such, it has warped fans&rsquo; perceptions of what is required to succeed in the league.<br>
Regardless, the following season he did actually have a team full of All Star quality players. Outside of himself, there were four players who had made the All Star team in their career and he also had another teammate who would make the All Defensive team <em>that season.</em><br>
You know how often Jordan had that many teammates with an All Star on their resume? Never.<br>
So why did they fail?<br>
In 2009 they made it to the Conference Finals without losing a single game. Their overall record was 74-16 (0.822) at that point. Jordan&rsquo;s Bulls had a better record heading into a Conference Finals just twice, both times going on to win the championship. The Cavs&rsquo; opponents were the Dwight led Magic who had an overall record of 67-28 (0.705). They had struggled in the playoffs to that point, winning both series in six and then seven games as opposed to the Cavs so far sweeping their way to that point. Heading into game six, LeBron was absolutely dominating the series averaging an insane 42ppg on great efficiency. Continuing that form would have seen a Cavs victory and the series move back to their home court for game 7. But it wasn&rsquo;t LeBron who would come up big with a 40 point game it was, instead, Dwight Howard who scored 40 and led his team to victory. LeBron managed to only score 17 less than his series average on just 40% shooting. He choked and the LeChoke nickname was born.<br>
The following season would see another terrible elimination game performance from him, shooting just 38% and famously quitting on his team late in that game. He choked, again.<br>
He then ran with his tail between his legs to form what is probably the first player built superteam which of course breaks every anti tampering and collusion rule in the book. It was one of the weakest moves in NBA history, probably only surpassed by KD going to the Warriors. Of course that doesn&rsquo;t stop the hypocrisy pouring out of the LeBron fan base, chiding KD for that move at every opportunity, not considering the fact it was LeBron who paved the way for that move to happen.<br>
People also forget the abhorrent way he left Miami, after his good buddy Wade left millions on the table in his own contract negotiation with the sole reason being so that the team could afford to resign LeBron. How was he repaid for his insanely good deed? LeBron went radio silent, ignoring him and the team as they tried to get in contact with him before he eventually announced his decision to go back home to the Cavs &lsquo;for the good of the local economy&rsquo; and highly suggesting he was there for good and would retire a Cavalier. That didn&rsquo;t last long. Before his four year contract was up he would be in deep negotiations with Anthony Davis, convincing him to breach his contract with NO and join him in LA. Probably unsurprisingly Kawhi would also demand a trade to LA at the same time with rumours rife that he was wanting to join the Lakers. What a surprise, I wonder who gave him that idea?<br>
LeBron has walked the easiest path to success he could possibly pave, shying away from hard work and actually building a team the right way because of his utter obsession to be considered the GOAT. Too bad for him it&rsquo;s mostly just kids too young to know any better who have been convinced of his deluded opinion of himself so far.</p>

If a so called one man army can win 61 and 66 games consecutively, why does he not have enough to win a championship? </p>

At the time these were two mvp level players and a 26 year old 5x Allstar who many thought had the potential to be as good as garnett, Duncan, and dirk. It was unheard of.

Don’t get me wrong what KD did was bad but Lebron basically screwed the eastern conference twice, screwed Toronto and Cleveland and then screwed Miami when it was already even weaker than it was before. Weak moves. Choosing to stay in the eastern conference twice is weak af especially after leaving CLE. If he went to HOU in 2010 even w Bosh and Wade (I don’t think they had the money for all 3 but let’s play it out) his tenure would be much more respected as that would’ve meant they had to play quality competition to get to the finals, not 1 team in 3 rounds smh</p>
