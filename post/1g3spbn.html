      <label for="lry8cy7" class="commentText"><p>Lebron got ripped for that move more than KD did for going to GS. That first year in Miami was one for the record books. They got booed damn near every arena. Everyone was dogging them to the point you had women in hair salons who didn’t usually care for “mens sports” that was talking shit about Lebron lol</p>

<p>And when they lost to Dallas?? Bro summer 2011 with the lockout was crazy. Lebron was getting meme’d crazy. Multiple YouTube videos slamming him, calling him all sorts of punks and pussies</p>

<p>They even wrote book about him called “the whore of Akron”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A native son of Akron, Ohio, LeBron James seemed like a miracle heaven-sent by God to transform Cleveland’s losing ways when he was drafted by the Cavaliers in 2003. But after seven years—and still no parade down Euclid Avenue—he left, announcing his move to South Beach on a nationally televised ESPN production with a sly title that echoed fifty years of misery. The Catch, The Drive, The Shot &hellip; The Decision.
Out of James’s treachery grew a monster. Scott Raab, a fifty-nine-year-old, 350-pound Jewish Santa Claus with a Chief Wahoo tattoo, would bear witness to LeBron’s every move, and in so doing would act as the eyes and ears of Cleveland itself. Crude but warmhearted, poetic but raving, hilarious, profane (and profound), The Whore of Akron is both a rabid fan’s indictment of a traitorous athlete and the story of Raab’s obsessive quest to reveal the “wee jewel-box” of LeBron James’s soul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.scottraab.com/youre-welcome-cleveland-1" target="_blank">The Whore of Akron</a></p>

<p>Ain’t nobody write no fucking book about no damn KD lmaoo. I feel like the difference is people who don’t watch basketball/sports couldn’t care any less that KD went to Golden State. In fact if you were rooting for a tanking team at the time or if you were team chaos, you didn’t care that he went to GS either and probably found it amusing cause of all the bullshit that would transpire after.</p>

<p><em>everybody</em> cared about LeBron going to Miami. I remember when they did Beat OKC in 2012, they flashed the cameras over to a bar in Ohio and everyone was looking depressed. The crowd stretched from the bar to the outside lmaooo</p>

<p>2012 bosh is injured most the playoffs, wade&rsquo;s knees are up and down, benched, arguing with spo, getting them drained, down 2-1 in indy he goes and gets 40/18/9</p>

<p>down 3-2 heading to boston, goes and gets 45/15/5</p>

<p>i love KD, but he never really had to overcome&hellip; the most was the 2018 rockets but CP got injured</p>

<p>playoffs is all that matters</p>

<p>in the 2012 RS he was awesome, but still missed like 20 games because of knee stuff, which hurt him int he playoffs too, first 8 games he was 20 ppg on bad shooting, his final game was <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub> where him and spo went at it, he got his knees drained, was elite for 5 games, and then went back to 80% of wade averaging like 22 on 42% shooting</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t blame him for any of it, like at all, it&rsquo;s all about health, and by the playoffs, he was 75-80% of his RS self</p>

<p>it got worse and worse to the point where Spo had to be like can you relax with some of these shots and Wade had to have Haslem and Juwan be like bro calm down, and then he gets his knees drained, is ELITE for 5 games, and then back to 80% of Wade</p>

<p>if i&rsquo;m being honest, ya&rsquo;ll are the ones slandering Wade really if ya&rsquo;ll think that Wade is still peak Wade</p>

<p>edit: because this was peak me being in HS and having no job, i was watching all the sports shows on ESPN, THEY WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT HIS KNEE TOO AND HOW HE EVEN KNOWS HE&rsquo;S NOT PLAYING LIKE HE COULD BE BECAUSE OF IT</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s just reality, i love wade, top 3 SG ever still over Harden to me clearly, it&rsquo;s all about health, and his body couldn&rsquo;t do full seasons anymore, and it got worse each year in the playoffs</p>

<p>I think there are times in sports people expect perfection from athletes.</p>

<p>Also, should watch the clip of Mark Cuban getting onto Skip for calling LeBron a failure. Game plans work out, they had their system to nullify Bron and gamble on what the others will do, hoping they fail on plays.</p>

I remember that whole era cause I was one of the many hating. I also remember the reaction to KD’s decision. KD’s decision was really only relevant in the sports landscape but I swear everybody really was on Lebron’s ass in 2010. There were people I didn’t know watched ball that were on twitter calling him Lebitch and Letraitor. KD’s situation only drew maybe half the hate especially since the warriors went in to win. LeBron doing all of that and losing in 2011 was truly a moment in sports history</p>

      <label for="lryg8fr" class="commentText"><p>Nah, LeBron got ripped apart largely bc he dumped his hometown team on a self orchestrated TV special to announce he’s joining a super team in Miami. He would’ve gotten ripped apart regardless, but doing “The Decision” like he did just made the hate go up exponentially.</p>

<p>I would also argue that KD has gotten SIGNIFICANTLY more hate for going to GS than LeBron got for going to Miami. The LeBron hate fest was largely over by the time he was done in Miami, and was 100% done once he won that legendary championship with Cleveland.</p>

<p>If you want to say the intensity of the hate in the moment was greater for LeBron, you definitely have a point. With that said, KD still gets shit on for going to GSW. I would argue the collective amount of hate KD has gotten over the last 8+ years is more than what LeBron.</p>

<p>They’re <strong>VERY</strong> different situations, and KD’s is objectively worse since he joined the team that they just lost to in the WCF. KD doesn’t really have a shot at a redemption arc, so he’s kinda just stuck with this stain forever.</p>

      <label for="lrydmwd" class="commentText"><p>Still the most lame uncompetitive move I’ve seen in sports tbh. KD was close but at least the rest of the teams core was built through the draft. Besides D Wade and Haslem the rest of Miami was a bunch of mercenaries gathered around to help LeBron get some free rings.</p>

<p>It was the right move too because the amount of people who hindsight it and say those rings were legit are 10,000x greater than they were back when they won them.</p>

<p>The 2011 Heatles team also didn’t even have role players. They also all did it while they all happened to be free agents with a teams cap space - much different than the forced trade business that goes around now.</p>

<p>despite playing with PG, Kawhi, AD, Harden, Beal, Lebron in the 8 years since 2016, Westbrook has yet to win a full playoff series. what KD did with Westbrook is added legacy points</p>

<li>kg played til 2016, a full 8 years after the first deal, that’s one less year between 2010 and 2019 when wade retired. also wade pretty much had no legs, 2 years into the heatles</li>
</ul>

<p>-paul pierce played until 2017, 9 years afterwards, bron does blow this out of the water though, still in the league 12 years after the heatles began</p>

<p>-allen played until 2014 6 years afterwards 2008 (with a reduced role for the final 2 years), bosh (i understand there are different circumstances regarding boshs blood clots that may make it unfair to compare him to allen, but i’m trying to make a point here) retired in 2016, 6 years (the same time period) after the heatles first began</p>

<p>Lebron was out here coordinating pay cuts with other players and their agents, getting assurances that he was going to have all-nba teammates before signing with a team in free agency, getting 50-win coaches fired etc. He&rsquo;s exercised power and influence in a way that no player ever has.</p>

<p>If teams have so much power to move pieces and trade at no notice. There was gonna come a time players will do the same.</p>

<p>At least he, at the minimum, ran down his contracts and not ask for trade/not play until a situation was resolved. It is an ass move but his career he always gave 100% and committed to the contracts he signed. He just liked to have control of his future which I think is fine.</p>

<p>You can try to justify this as much as you like because you like LeBron more the KD but as Charles Barkley said, the concept is the same behind both moves. It’s to stack the deck so much you cannot not win a championship from it.</p>

      <label for="lry9jwk" class="commentText"><p>only reason lebron was able to shed it is cause winning a title as the guy is showing that you&rsquo;re really that guy</p>

<p>and 2012 - bosh injured, wade&rsquo;s getting benched and arguing with spo, lebron goes and gets 40/18/9, wade gets his knees drained, is good for 5 games, literally, and then back to like 80% of wade, lebron goes and gets 45/15/5</p>

<p>2013 - i&rsquo;m convinced of either 2 things. 1. you&rsquo;re all gaslighting me, 2. some of yall were just not alive to watch it. because wade&rsquo;s knees were DONE, i don&rsquo;t blame him at all, it&rsquo;s all about health, but that was a one man show + defense + just smart vets, it was not a oh we have 2 top 5 guys and we&rsquo;re just dominating l</p>

<p>Edit: 9 players, in the entire NBA scored 20+ per game in 2012-2013. 9. Absolutely unreal. Knees probably didn’t work though.</p>

<p>idk where the 21/5/5 you&rsquo;re talking about is coming from, i&rsquo;m guessing the RS which literally does not matter, it&rsquo;s about the playoffs</p>

<p>edit: once again, because i have to make this clear, i love wade, top 3 sg ever, it&rsquo;s all about health, i don&rsquo;t blame him at all</p>

He was amazing in the regular season and they went on a winning streak to come close to the all time record. He would then injure his knee during that streak, which was near the end of the season, and never be the same again. His playoffs were horrible he averaged 16 points on 45/25/75 in 2013 and it would go downhill from there</p>

      <label for="lrydg50" class="commentText"><p>Lebron going to Miami was universally viewed all-time weak move. The &ldquo;best player in the league teaming up with his buddies because he can&rsquo;t win with the team that was given&rdquo; will always be an argument used against Lebron in GOAT debates. Ring chasing has always been a thing but it&rsquo;s incredibly rare for the best player in the league to ring chase this obviously. Lebron&rsquo;s return to Cleveland obviously meant he had a high level of organizational control and brought about the &ldquo;LeGM&rdquo; memes that are still enduring today.</p>

      <label for="lryc0to" class="commentText"><p>Doing this twice in a pathetic conference makes it more embarrassing than what KD did. Don’t get me wrong what KD did was bad but Lebron basically screwed the eastern conference twice, screwed Toronto and Cleveland and then screwed Miami when it was already even weaker than it was before. Weak moves. Choosing to stay in the eastern conference twice is weak af especially after leaving CLE. If he went to HOU in 2010 even w Bosh and Wade (I don’t think they had the money for all 3 but let’s play it out) his tenure would be much more respected as that would’ve meant they had to play quality competition to get to the finals, not 1 team in 3 rounds smh</p>

      <label for="lrycudb" class="commentText"><p>It honestly ended up not being as OP as people expected. Like yeah they were great ofc but none of those Heat teams are actually considered up there with the greatest teams ever (the best Warriors, Bulls, Celtics teams for example). The championships weren’t even that dominant. People forget that baby 2012 OKC team was actually <em>favored</em> in the Finals. Even the 2011 Mavs, while underdogs, had better odds than teams like the 2024 Mavs.</p>

<p>This is especially notable because… they had LeBron! One of the greatest peaks ever, if not the greatest!</p>

<p>I think this is mainly due to (a) Wade and Bosh declining sooner than expected, health being a factor, (b) the playstyle synergy of the stars was never that great, it was just friends wanting to play together, and &copy; Spoelstra’s one of the finest coaches in the history of the game but I think he improved a ton post-Heatles.</p>

<p>Point (b) is underlooked imo - Wade and LeBron were never really the best fit. They’re a very similar mold of player - best with the ball in their hands and attacking the paint, not quite as effective off-ball, don’t space the floor much. And of course Bosh had to adapt his game significantly in order to fit. I’d go as far as to say that the Heatles were worse than the sum of their parts.</p>

      <label for="lryep4b" class="commentText"><p>The LeBron-Miami move, and how it got re-litigated after KD, with people trying to say after the fact that people &ldquo;understood the move&rdquo; or &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t the same thing&rdquo; is the best piece of evidence that as a player you should do the selfish thing, and with time someone else will do the other selfish thing and your selfish thing won&rsquo;t look so bad in retrospect. I remember hearing a decade ago how much Bron&rsquo;s two in Miami didn&rsquo;t count, and yet here we are, outside of stuff like this, I never hear about how the Miami rings were fugazi</p>
