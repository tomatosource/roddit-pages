</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As of today, SGA, Jalen Williams, and Chet are 26, 23, and 22 respectively. For comparison, KD, Westbrook, and Harden were 23, 23, and 22 in the 2012 finals. If we add up the current OKC big 3&rsquo;s ages as of today&rsquo;s date and compare it to the sum of the old big 3&rsquo;s ages on June 21st 2012, we get 26197 days vs 25623 days.</p>

<p>Actually crazy how different the 2 teams are viewed. Today&rsquo;s OKC is the second youngest team in the league and one of the contenders for the next dynasty with everybody saying they&rsquo;ll probably run the league one day. Their future is seemingly bright after making the playoffs for the first time with SGA as the first option. Meanwhile, 2012 OKC had been to the CF the previous year and looked monstrous in the playoffs. They swept defending champs Mavs, beat Lakers in 6, beat Spurs who were on fire in 6, and were the favorites against the Miami superteam with 27 year old Lebron. The 2012 big 3 would go on to all join Team USA at the olympics that summer before the end of an era when James Harden got traded.</p>

<p>Correct me if I’m wrong but don’t they also have Collison and Nazr Mohammed on the bench as well if they need any big bodies? Perkins salary really destroyed that team.</p>

It&rsquo;s one of those freak things that I can&rsquo;t see happening again at least for multiple decades. The stars need to align perfectly with a team having high picks for 3 years in a row, as well drafting the best player all 3 times, who also happens to actually amount to MVP level. There&rsquo;s plenty of drafts who never even produce one MVP. To have 3 drafts in a row that have an MVP, all 3 of those MVPS being picked by a team 3 years in a row is just absurd.</p>

If they dont, then depending on 2nd round pull, we could be bounced again easily. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Best shot at a title is this year which is why I personally thought you guys should have traded the picks for lauri.</p>

<p>Caruso is a big time get so you&rsquo;ll be in the mix but not overpaying for lauri was a mistake imo.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t personally feel like hartenstein is gonna do that great. He has only ever looked that good with the knicks under thibs.</p>

To me he seems like a great fit for OKC, can space the floor a little, great on the boards (which we needed desperately) and a good passer for a big man.

<p>Things weren&rsquo;t as clear cut as people make it out to be. Not every team was dedicated to just shooting and defense.</p>

<p>in all the playoff series Westbrook played with KD, he shot under 40% in 40% of them lol. you can&rsquo;t consistently win with a guy who&rsquo;s that inefficient and high volume</p>

The team wasn&rsquo;t stacked, but if there were no drops in KD&rsquo;s game in the playoffs, he for sure has 2 rings by now imo</p>

<p>the 2011-12 team had 4 players shoot over 35% from 3 (KD, Harden, Sefalosha and Eric Maynor). This Thunder team has 9 guys that shot at least 37% from three last year.</p>

<p>and the draft capital between these two iterations of the thunder is astronomical.</p>

      <label for="libvq29" class="commentText"><p>na. fit matters not just 3pt %. literally the point of role players is to find roles and adjust to starters. perk being the big body bully allows ibaka the freedom to make defensive plays and take pressure off gaurding post. perk would be better vs joker then isiah. harden russ both were able to and did run point allowing thabos to cover them on defense and slide in at the 2 or 3 since kd could fill 3 and 4. and nick as a solid big as well. caruso dort shai willaims. theres not enough minutes there. isiah was a crucial pick up for chet but whos behind them. they wont stop joker unlike a perk ibaka combo potentially could. having to sit alex or lou makes it where i think 12 wins. honesly i woulda kept josh but thats a hot take </p>

      <label for="lic40dl" class="commentText"><p>There are a few reasons the first being that people forget about his rookie year with the Clippers because while he showed some flashes he wasn’t anything crazy at that time and the second being that 3 years of his career from 21-23 were during the Thunder’s tanking years where most people weren’t paying attention to the Thunder. As a result even though he is 26 and entering his 7th year in the league people group him in with guys like Ant, Scottie Barnes and Tyrese Haliburton, who are still under or just finishing up their rookie contracts.</p>

<p>What people don&rsquo;t realise is that people are arguably more excited for this squad, because the best three players are so complementary. </p>

<p>That 2012 squad, though very talented had huge overlaps in skill set. They absolutely overpowered team on talent, but this team will continue to grow and actually has a runway (versus 2012).</p>

<p>This year will be the equivalent year (24-25) to 2012 and I think it may be shocking just how good this team is.</p>

      <label for="libvexo" class="commentText"><p>Question: is the top end talent in the league (i.e. top 15 or so players) worse than a decade ago?</p>

<p>There’s zero doubt in my mind that the supporting casts would wipe the floor with those of years past, but the top end talent doesn’t seem to be there right now. Giannis, Luka, and Jokic are good, but they don’t really compare to LeBron/KD/Steph, Magic/Bird/Jordan, or even Shaq/Kobe/Duncan.</p>

<p>On the other hand maybe it just feels like that cause we’re entering an interesting era where your superstar can no longer guarantee you a conference finals appearance regardless of supporting cast like they could a decade ago.</p>

      <label for="lic1dix" class="commentText"><p>Giannis, Luka, and Jokic are honestly pretty comparable, considering how early into their careers they are. They already have as many MVPs as Shaq, Kobe, and Duncan. They have very good stats, even relative to their peers when considering inflation for pace and playstyle. Championships are lower, but they&rsquo;re still playing, and the league has the most parity it has seen since the 70s.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not even counting the fact that the top 75 players in this era would wipe the top 75 in any previous era. They&rsquo;re doing it against better competition. (No disrespect, that&rsquo;s the evolution of pretty much any sport)</p>

      <label for="licaosg" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough, hindsight skews toward the past.</p>

<p>I think a different way to look at it is we’re around the tail end of the generational transition period. I think the true big 3 of this decade is still to come, and my best bet would be that it’s Wemby, Luka, and Giannis/Jokic (depending on who accomplishes more in the next few years).</p>

<p>I think this weird Giannis, Embiid, and Jokic era feels kinda like those few years between Shaq leaving LA and LeBron ascending to certified best player in the league. There were all time greats like KG, Duncan, and Kobe holding it down, but when you think back on the titans of the sport it’s not the first place your mind goes. You think of the Bird and Magics, the Jordans, the LeBron and Stephs, the Shaq and Kobes. Giannis, Luka, and Jokic feel like Duncan, KG, and Kobe, and to attribute them one to one I’ll say Giannis=KG, Jokic=Duncan, and Luka=Kobe. I think we’re approaching our next LeBron (Wemby), and maybe even our next KD (Flagg).</p>

      <label for="lic1oez" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think this is the case tbh. Giannis and Jokic will probably be looked at similarly to KD/ steph by the times their careers are done, considering their unique skill sets and the way they impact the game. Luka is still a bit young for this conversation too imo, idt we’ve seen his proper prime yet. Lebron is an outlier, but wemby seems like he could (still super early) be on that trajectory, although he’s in the next era of the nba.</p>

<p>I think you’re kinda cherry picking in terms of players too - Magic and bird were done by the early 90s while Jordan was winning all of his rings, Lebron could easily be grouped with older players instead of KD and steph, while Kobe could be replaced with someone a little older like KG. Either way, even though Luka, Giannis and Jokic look like the best right now, we might reconsider in a few years once all is said and done. I’m not saying this was intentional by you but it’s sort of just what happens when we look to the past.</p>

<p>There was no way Lebron was being denied that year. Not after finally exorcising the Boston demons. On the other end very rarely do super young teams like the Thunder win their first Finals appearance vs a far more experienced opponent in their primes like the Heatles were. See also Celtics &lsquo;22.</p>

      <label for="licxlvh" class="commentText"><p>I’m just not sure what a highlight reel from 6 years ago has to do with the media commentary from 2012. Doesn’t prove your point or disprove mine. Might just be an agree to disagree situation haha.</p>

<p>When I Google 2012 finals predictions, there are countless articles of people doubting the heat.</p>

<p>Here’s a quote from SB nation relevant to your argument.  “Miami needs LeBron to be at that Game 6, “F—k You” level for 4-5 games here, and I’m not sure he’s got it in him. Thunder in 6.”</p>

<p>The level of disrespect and hate that Lebron faced after the 2011 finals has been majorly down played because of how elite he has been since then.</p>

      <label for="lid0aib" class="commentText"><p>??? 6 years ago? Again, did you watch the video or not?? It was literally 2 games before the start of the Finals lmfao. If he doesn&rsquo;t play the clutchest game of his life he gets bounced by Boston AGAIN, the Heatles probably break up, and his legacy is prob permanently stained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Miami needs LeBron to be at that Game 6</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that would be the game they&rsquo;re referencing lmfao. And yes he was at that level in the Finals. Again, only contrarians thought he wouldn&rsquo;t be, it&rsquo;s fucking SBNation of course they&rsquo;re idiot clickbaiters. You don&rsquo;t get past the biggest obstacle that&rsquo;s been blocking you for 4 years with an all-time great performance just to lose to the baby Thunder. That&rsquo;d be like MJ losing to the old and washed Lakers with Magic with HIV after finally getting past the Bad Boy Pistons. You&rsquo;re simply delusional if you really thought Lebron was going to lose that Finals lmfao.</p>

It’s also a highlight reel. That in no way shows what the media landscape at the time was like. It’s not just SBnation. It’s easily googled right there. Many many people wrongly picked the thunder purely from Lebron hate. Quite literally never said I thought Lebron would lose those finals.</p>

      <label for="licay45" class="commentText"><p>They weren’t really a big three because Harden came off of the bench. That’s what worked best for the team, but that’s not technically what a big three is. He is the same thing that Jalen Brunson was when he played for the Mavericks. Every team needs that guy off the bench, but that guy eventually wants to start and get paid like a starter. And that’s why it’s hard to keep teams together.</p>

      <label for="lickgu2" class="commentText"><p>Yep, Thunder&rsquo;s biggest problem right now is the new CBA rules. When it kicks in, it kills your depth and star power. They will have to decide in a year or two which 2 of the 3 they max and who will they trade/leave in free agency. Also why picks are so important now and teams are hesitant to move them, because you can draft some older players who can be a role player on a team.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of ironic they went from being cheap to now being able to spend money but restricted by the new rules. Judging by the replies in this thread, I don&rsquo;t think most of OKC fans realize just how much this will hamper their young core.</p>
