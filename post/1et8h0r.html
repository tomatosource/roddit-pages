</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As of today, SGA, Jalen Williams, and Chet are 26, 23, and 22 respectively. For comparison, KD, Westbrook, and Harden were 23, 23, and 22 in the 2012 finals. If we add up the current OKC big 3&rsquo;s ages as of today&rsquo;s date and compare it to the sum of the old big 3&rsquo;s ages on June 21st 2012, we get 26197 days vs 25623 days.</p>

<p>Actually crazy how different the 2 teams are viewed. Today&rsquo;s OKC is the second youngest team in the league and one of the contenders for the next dynasty with everybody saying they&rsquo;ll probably run the league one day. Their future is seemingly bright after making the playoffs for the first time with SGA as the first option. Meanwhile, 2012 OKC had been to the CF the previous year and looked monstrous in the playoffs. They swept defending champs Mavs, beat Lakers in 6, beat Spurs who were on fire in 6, and were the favorites against the Miami superteam with 27 year old Lebron. The 2012 big 3 would go on to all join Team USA at the olympics that summer before the end of an era when James Harden got traded.</p>

<p>i mean the two guards who went after him are jerryd bayless and dj augustin, undersized and unathletic guards that no one projected into meaningful nba careers. there wasn&rsquo;t much competition that year, that&rsquo;s why westbrook went so high.</p>

<p>Correct me if I’m wrong but don’t they also have Collison and Nazr Mohammed on the bench as well if they need any big bodies? Perkins salary really destroyed that team.</p>

But Ibaka had great Defense against pau and showed off his athleticism on the offesnsive end. That was amazing the next year is when we beat Kobe and Russ made that crazy and 1 being held back by one of their guards. That was An amazing time for our team</p>

It&rsquo;s one of those freak things that I can&rsquo;t see happening again at least for multiple decades. The stars need to align perfectly with a team having high picks for 3 years in a row, as well drafting the best player all 3 times, who also happens to actually amount to MVP level. There&rsquo;s plenty of drafts who never even produce one MVP. To have 3 drafts in a row that have an MVP, all 3 of those MVPS being picked by a team 3 years in a row is just absurd.</p>

      <label for="licwy4k" class="commentText"><p>There is something to be said for proving it. However last year I felt like they were at least a year away simply because they needed to actually see the playoffs (Shai had but not as the primary defensive assignment for the other team) so they could spend the next season tuning up with actual understanding of what comes next.</p>

<p>Adding Caruso also helps since he was a real contributor to a title.</p>

Hence the Thunder trading for Kendrick Perkins rather than putting Ibaka at the 5 and getting another shooter. The Warriors eventually demonstrated the value of offensive skill players, but even they traded for Andrew Bogut once upon a time, and played Draymond at the 3.</p>

      <label for="liezmxs" class="commentText"><p>And the team construction makes more sense particularly with better shooting surrounding the big 3. Further, the draft assets the Thunder have are going to be important in either trading for players or drafting young cheap talent around the big 3 for a sustainable run. We’ll find out if they ever win a chip. However, they are better positioned with a better team buildout for long term success.</p>

<p>Also, people reacting to redditors talking about the Thunder running the league or random online personalities talking about the next dynasty it’s pretty obviously either A) people just saying shit when they’re excited or B) people trying to make the claim now on the chance we look back in 10 years and say that dude called it. Like we can acknowledge the team is well positioned with an exciting future, and just disregard the ridiculous “the next Warriors/Spurs” takes. Let’s just see what happens and have some fun.</p>

Chandler absolutely would have been the difference.</p>

      <label for="lidcyyq" class="commentText"><p>I do think he deserves credit for that. He was genuinely one of the most important locker room voices on a team with fundamental leadership issues, and there was absolutely a marked difference in both their defensive attitude and intensity after his arrival. He was one of the main reasons we beat the Spurs in the 2012 WCF, playing on a torn groin and wrist.</p>

<p>He also did one of the most important thing a diminished locker room vet can do by stepping up and mentoring Steven when he arrived, then happily giving up his starting spot to him when the time came. In early 2014-2015 when injuries had us down to like 7 fucking players, he was visibly the leader of the team (&ldquo;These motherfuckers are STILL the Sacramento Kings!&rdquo;). As funny/frustrating as watching him try and fail to put the ball in the basket was, he mattered a lot to those teams</p>

      <label for="lie485u" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s funny, but Perkins greatest attributes weren&rsquo;t what he did for your team, but what he took away from the other team. Perkins would get destroyed by the modern big man who can shoot, but that was straight up not a thing during his career and he made his living mucking it up with the other teams center. He pretty much guaranteed that post play wasn&rsquo;t going to be where the other team beat you. He wasn&rsquo;t winning you games, but he wasn&rsquo;t losing you games either.</p>

They could have just stuck it out with Kristic and play Ibaka at the 5 in crunch time and slide KD to the 4 or some shit. It&rsquo;s not like the 2010 teams had overpowering fives. I guess the Bynum/Gasol/Odom frontline was gonna be a problem but they needed to guard KD too.</p>

If we assume (which I often do) that Tyson happens and doesn’t change the team’s ability to draft Harden, then that’s a dynasty. Sorry to make you relive that pain, but it’s not one title. As is they were formidable, much less if they had that death squad. The landscape entirely changes, not sure the Heatles or Dubs can really slow them down. We probably wouldn’t even know who Draymond is, and Klay would have been at best a 2x all-star.</p>

The team wasn&rsquo;t stacked, but if there were no drops in KD&rsquo;s game in the playoffs, he for sure has 2 rings by now imo</p>

<p>the 2011-12 team had 4 players shoot over 35% from 3 (KD, Harden, Sefalosha and Eric Maynor). This Thunder team has 9 guys that shot at least 37% from three last year.</p>

<p>and the draft capital between these two iterations of the thunder is astronomical.</p>

      <label for="libvq29" class="commentText"><p>na. fit matters not just 3pt %. literally the point of role players is to find roles and adjust to starters. perk being the big body bully allows ibaka the freedom to make defensive plays and take pressure off gaurding post. perk would be better vs joker then isiah. harden russ both were able to and did run point allowing thabos to cover them on defense and slide in at the 2 or 3 since kd could fill 3 and 4. and nick as a solid big as well. caruso dort shai willaims. theres not enough minutes there. isiah was a crucial pick up for chet but whos behind them. they wont stop joker unlike a perk ibaka combo potentially could. having to sit alex or lou makes it where i think 12 wins. honesly i woulda kept josh but thats a hot take </p>

<p>the &ldquo;big three&rdquo; might not be as good this time around, but the team has a chance to be a lot better</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except this is already objectively wrong. KD, Harden and Westbrook made it into the finals at a younger age than the current OKC big 3, losing only to prime Lebron, Wade and Bosh. They already went deeper into the playoffs, at a younger age.</p>

<p>If the big old 3 stay together, there is no chance in hell they are not a better team than the current OKC team. I am taking a 26 year old Durant, Harden and Westbrook on the same team over any other team in this league right now.</p>

      <label for="lic40dl" class="commentText"><p>There are a few reasons the first being that people forget about his rookie year with the Clippers because while he showed some flashes he wasn’t anything crazy at that time and the second being that 3 years of his career from 21-23 were during the Thunder’s tanking years where most people weren’t paying attention to the Thunder. As a result even though he is 26 and entering his 7th year in the league people group him in with guys like Ant, Scottie Barnes and Tyrese Haliburton, who are still under or just finishing up their rookie contracts.</p>

<p>What people don&rsquo;t realise is that people are arguably more excited for this squad, because the best three players are so complementary. </p>

<p>That 2012 squad, though very talented had huge overlaps in skill set. They absolutely overpowered team on talent, but this team will continue to grow and actually has a runway (versus 2012).</p>

<p>This year will be the equivalent year (24-25) to 2012 and I think it may be shocking just how good this team is.</p>

      <label for="lid3n9i" class="commentText"><p>After adding Hartenstein (shoring up their biggest weakness) and Caruso along with the growth of the young players and having an MVP candidate I&rsquo;m not sure how many people are going to be shocked. Most will have them as one of the best teams in the league and a championship contender. The Shai, Dort, JDub, Chet, Hartenstein lineup will rival any other team&rsquo;s best lineup and they have good bench depth. The only question mark they have is playmaking with Giddey gone so Wallace&rsquo;s growth as the backup PG will be the key for them.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between this core and the last one is the last one had 3 alphas on offense and 2 of them didn&rsquo;t make major impacts on the game when they didn&rsquo;t have the ball in their hands, so the sum of their parts was less than their individual talents. This core has 3 2-way players with 1 alpha and 1 of them is a big. The big+little synergy is a big advantage and allows them to play off each other much better than 3 ball dominant perimeter players.</p>

      <label for="libvexo" class="commentText"><p>Question: is the top end talent in the league (i.e. top 15 or so players) worse than a decade ago?</p>

<p>There’s zero doubt in my mind that the supporting casts would wipe the floor with those of years past, but the top end talent doesn’t seem to be there right now. Giannis, Luka, and Jokic are good, but they don’t really compare to LeBron/KD/Steph, Magic/Bird/Jordan, or even Shaq/Kobe/Duncan.</p>

<p>On the other hand maybe it just feels like that cause we’re entering an interesting era where your superstar can no longer guarantee you a conference finals appearance regardless of supporting cast like they could a decade ago.</p>

      <label for="lic1dix" class="commentText"><p>Giannis, Luka, and Jokic are honestly pretty comparable, considering how early into their careers they are. They already have as many MVPs as Shaq, Kobe, and Duncan. They have very good stats, even relative to their peers when considering inflation for pace and playstyle. Championships are lower, but they&rsquo;re still playing, and the league has the most parity it has seen since the 70s.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not even counting the fact that the top 75 players in this era would wipe the top 75 in any previous era. They&rsquo;re doing it against better competition. (No disrespect, that&rsquo;s the evolution of pretty much any sport)</p>

      <label for="licaosg" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough, hindsight skews toward the past.</p>

<p>I think a different way to look at it is we’re around the tail end of the generational transition period. I think the true big 3 of this decade is still to come, and my best bet would be that it’s Wemby, Luka, and Giannis/Jokic (depending on who accomplishes more in the next few years).</p>

<p>I think this weird Giannis, Embiid, and Jokic era feels kinda like those few years between Shaq leaving LA and LeBron ascending to certified best player in the league. There were all time greats like KG, Duncan, and Kobe holding it down, but when you think back on the titans of the sport it’s not the first place your mind goes. You think of the Bird and Magics, the Jordans, the LeBron and Stephs, the Shaq and Kobes. Giannis, Luka, and Jokic feel like Duncan, KG, and Kobe, and to attribute them one to one I’ll say Giannis=KG, Jokic=Duncan, and Luka=Kobe. I think we’re approaching our next LeBron (Wemby), and maybe even our next KD (Flagg).</p>

      <label for="lic1oez" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think this is the case tbh. Giannis and Jokic will probably be looked at similarly to KD/ steph by the times their careers are done, considering their unique skill sets and the way they impact the game. Luka is still a bit young for this conversation too imo, idt we’ve seen his proper prime yet. Lebron is an outlier, but wemby seems like he could (still super early) be on that trajectory, although he’s in the next era of the nba.</p>

<p>I think you’re kinda cherry picking in terms of players too - Magic and bird were done by the early 90s while Jordan was winning all of his rings, Lebron could easily be grouped with older players instead of KD and steph, while Kobe could be replaced with someone a little older like KG. Either way, even though Luka, Giannis and Jokic look like the best right now, we might reconsider in a few years once all is said and done. I’m not saying this was intentional by you but it’s sort of just what happens when we look to the past.</p>

That Thunder team had a stronger star trio, but the team depth wasn&rsquo;t quite as good and they didn&rsquo;t have the boatload of picks coming down the line. They were largely done building the team. This team still has moves left in it</p>

      <label for="licay45" class="commentText"><p>They weren’t really a big three because Harden came off of the bench. That’s what worked best for the team, but that’s not technically what a big three is. He is the same thing that Jalen Brunson was when he played for the Mavericks. Every team needs that guy off the bench, but that guy eventually wants to start and get paid like a starter. And that’s why it’s hard to keep teams together.</p>
