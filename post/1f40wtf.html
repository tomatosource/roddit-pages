</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I checked all nba first team from 1950s to now.</p>

<p>There were no repeated All Nba First Team in bcak to back seasons!!!</p>

<p>After 77 years, nba didn&rsquo;t experience to have a set of 5 players who are in all nba first team in back to back season.</p>

<p>There were some almost moments (like <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> players repeated). But no complete <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> players repeated as All Nba First Team</p>

<p>For ex:</p>

<p>2024: Jokic, SGA, Luka, Giannis Tatum</p>

<p>For it to be back to back,</p>

<p>2025 must have the same 5 all nba first team members too.</p>

<p>Never happened in history yet</p>

<p>Do you think we will see it in 2025? To have the same all nba first team members as 2024?🤔</p>

      <label for="lkik3p0" class="commentText"><p>I admit I’m irrationally high on Zion. I get he’s been injured and has his flaws but he’s the only other player in the last 5 years besides Wemby that I think had insane potential coming into the league and if he reaches that potential I think he can be absolutely better than any of those guys you listed and dominate the game in a way those 4 can’t. He’s younger than Fox and Brunson and the same age as Haliburton too.</p>

<p>But he should probably be in the dark horse category</p>

He belongs on the darkhorse list&hellip;dude was a solid 2nd teamer last year if not for the minimum games qualifier.

      <label for="lkijan3" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think the Cavs have the team around them to really highlight him that way. Timberwolves won 56 games last year and Ant was 2nd team. Mitchell, Booker and Ant are not players that are averaging near triple doubles or 30 PPG like most of the first teamers.</p>

<p>The only reason I’m putting Booker is because he’s been 1st team before. He’s also been All-NBA multiple times in the past 3 years, something only 10 players have done (Jokic, Giannis, Luka, Tatum, SGA, Embiid, LeBron, Curry, Durant, Booker).</p>

<p>And for Ant, he’s only 23 and is only going to get better. It’s not unreasonable to expect him to make a jump, but I’m not sure it’s a lock so that’s why I have him as a dark horse.</p>

<p>For Mitchell, he’s in his prime and so I don’t think he’s going to put up significantly better stats and he already averages slightly less points, assists, more turnovers, and slightly worse shooting percentages than Booker.</p>

<p>He could have a better year than Booker, but I think Booker is better. Your path to Mitchell being 1st team was a top 3 seed, when the teams around them (Philadelphia, New York, Orlando) got better and Cleveland more or less stayed the same. You’re basically banking on health led by a guy who has averaged 62 games the last 4 years, which isn’t even enough to qualify for awards anymore.</p>

<p>For the other comment about Ja, people forget how good he is because he’s been injured. Like Ant, he was 2nd team at 23 and can give you 27/8/6 on teams winning 50+ games. He was Ant before Ant.</p>

<p>For example next year, if embiid does not make 65 games again, I think the All nba 1st team from this year can repeat</p>

      <label for="lki7o8j" class="commentText"><p>Tatum got the gentlemen&rsquo;s vote. Technically the best guy on the best team, but the Celtics had two olympic caliber players that weren&rsquo;t him and it feels like that was the basis of their success. They are like those mid 2000s pistons teams.</p>

<p>I see him and brown on the second team and any number of people taking his spot.</p>

      <label for="lkic18b" class="commentText"><p>I love how “Olympic caliber player” has turned into the new Tatum cope. Please name one second team player who was better than Tatum last season for me. You said it was a gentleman’s vote so I’d like to hear who you think the actual second teamer who deserved it was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 guys on the team were role players on the Olympics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Celtics in 2022-23 were a 2 seed (best bet rating in the league) with horford, Jaylen, smart, and white as starters (only 1 role player on the olympic roster).</p>

<p>They made the finals in 2021-22 (2 seed with the best net rating in the league) with Jaylen (non all star who couldn’t dribble at that point), smart, theis, and horford as the starters (0 role players at the Olympics starting).</p>

<p>He’s better rn than he was in either of those years. Clearly “Olympic caliber players” aren’t the common denominator here.</p>

<p>I know people here are constantly seething over the Celtics rings but let’s be absolutely fr. There aren’t many players dragging a borderline all star+3 good role players to the finals/conference finals every year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mid 2000s pistons teams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chauncey billups (best player on the pistons) is closer in terms of basketball skill to a failed abortion than he is to tatum.</p>

<p>Tatum is a top 5 player in 0 statistical categories and is like 15th in win shares per 48.  He&rsquo;s just not a top 5 player by any measure except being the number one guy on a stacked team.</p>

<p>Consensus was that he didn’t deserve it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>win shares per 48</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As per NBA GMs, the best publically available stat to track player ability is Darko DPM. Tatum is third in that behind embiid and jokic (Giannis was playing hurt but usually he’s third).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>stacked team in 2023-24</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still doesn’t really explain him going to the finals with a borderline all star and 3 role players as help in 2022 though.</p>

<p>That’s a team that was supposed to be a play in squad that Tatum dragged to the finals.</p>

<p>IF you want to talk about dragging teams to the finals, you are looking for Jimmy Butler.</p>
