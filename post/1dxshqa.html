That&rsquo;s really good. And that&rsquo;s with them starting the season without Harden and going on a losing streak when they first integrated Harden. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if their squad has 50 wins this season.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why Clipper fans keep blaming Lue for that, look at the rosters the team has given him. Who exactly should he be playing instead? Did you guys want to see a bunch of Zubac/Theis or Plumlee/Tucker frontcourts out there with Kawhi, PG and Harden? When the Clippers had an actual PF in Marcus Morris, you guys complained that he played him too much. Morris was bad, but what other options did he have?</p>

<p>Yet again this year the Clippers have assembled a strange roster of Zubac and everyone else is guards and wings (unless Tucker or Mo Bamba actually get legit minutes). The Clippers do play a ton of small ball, but I&rsquo;d blame the FO for that, not Lue, unless you have proof that this is the kind of roster that Lue demands the FO give him.</p>

      <label for="lc46ugj" class="commentText"><p>I agree with everything you posted and injuries play a part too but there&rsquo;s no excuse for Kawhi playing 10% of his minutes last year at C and Mann playing as much as he did at PF. Norm played almost half his minutes at SF. Lue has always had a shorter rotation and will play guys out of position to stick to his rotation. He will tend to go small ending games regardless of the opponent matchup.</p>

<p>Do I think the front office is predominantly to blame? Yes, but I also think Lue has his tendencies and is quite stubborn with those tendencies.</p>

      <label for="lc47prj" class="commentText"><p>I would tend to put that all on the FO. Like I said, when Lue had an actual PF he could play (Morris), he played him, way more than most Clipper fans liked. Kawhi at C was competing for the spot with Plumlee, Theis and Tucker whenever Zubac was sitting. That&rsquo;s like nothing but bad options for Lue, and going with Kawhi there is a defensible position given the alternatives.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Lue is telling the FO he only wants a glut of guards and wings or if that&rsquo;s just Lawrence Frank who has a fetish for those positions, but the Clippers big moves this free agency were again to get more of those guys while leaving the frontcourt basically unaddressed (unless you think swapping in Bamba for Plumlee is some kind of major upgrade).</p>

<p>Lue can only play the guys that are on the roster. That&rsquo;s all this is.</p>

      <label for="lc48f4d" class="commentText"><p>I do think the Clippers brass and probably Lue himself prefers &ldquo;big wings/swing forwards&rdquo; than traditional 4&rsquo;s. It should be said, Morris himself played over 20% of his minutes in his final year at C although that made a little more sense since he can&rsquo;t move anymore and couldn&rsquo;t then.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with anything you&rsquo;ve posted. You&rsquo;re right.</p>

      <label for="lc45f7a" class="commentText"><p>People forgets that Ty Lue only got the head coaching job back then BECAUSE of LeBron.   They sacked David Blatt and LeBron basically hired Ty Lue.   Everyone questioned that hiring back then, because Ty Lue had no experience.   That&rsquo;s also &ldquo;nepotism&rdquo;, but LeBron just knew Ty&rsquo;s value and it worked out.</p>

<p>LeBron is already the most unique basketball mind and leader, with the highest BBIQ.  If you have LeBron, you don&rsquo;t need much from a coach anyway.  All you need is a Player&rsquo;s coach.  Someone who can manage the locker room during pressure,  someone who can heighten the defensive value, and handle rotations.   Especially the rotations when LeBron is OFF the floor..    Ty Lue was perfect for that.   Players like him</p>
