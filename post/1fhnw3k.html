      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fhnw3k/is_there_an_advanced_stat_that_takes_difficulty/"><p>Is there an advanced stat that takes difficulty level of shot attempts into account?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’m curious if there are any analytics or advanced stat that would account for the degree of difficulty involved in different attempts of the same shot type (e.g. a contested step back 3 from 26 ft out vs an open 22 ft corner 3 in transition)? I think a metric like this could help people look beyond percentages to show why certain players are more valuable despite having lower FG or 3pt percentages.</p>

<p>For example, in the 2014-15 regular season, Kyle Korver was the leader in 3 point percentage at 49.2%. Steph Curry, the leader in total 3PM for the season and that season’s MVP, was 3rd at 44.3%. Despite Korver being 4.9% more accurate from 3, I would argue that Curry was still more valuable that season as a 3 point shooter because he took deeper attempts, created those shots off the dribble more often than Korver, and converted more heavily contested shots later in the shot clock. Do we have a metric that takes these factors into account to determine which players are making more difficult shots?</p>

<p>TLDR - Which analytics take degree of difficulty into account when determining who is a better shooter?</p>

<p>Average wingspan is height + 2 inches. Average height for a man is 5’9 so average wingspan is 5’11. On average basically all adult men have a 6 foot wingspan.</p>

<p>I’d assume most of them have longer wingspan than their height, and if the average height is 6’7-6’8 you’re regularly dealing with people that boast 6’9 and above wingspans.</p>

<p>I think having 6ft of space against an 6’9+ wingspan nba player would still result in a contested shot. Not to mention if they’re leaping towards you haha</p>

      <label for="lncudoe" class="commentText"><p>That is true. But you’re leaving out how tall they are, how quick they are to get to the ball, etc. take for example Draymond Green. He plays the 5 at 6’8. He could potentially be an inch shorter or taller, but his wing span is bigger than he is. If you need an example of this listen to Iggy explain how his shot was blocked by Draymond.</p>

      <label for="lnbh0cl" class="commentText"><p>I dunno, but it seems a bit pointless to me.</p>

<p>The thing about shot dificulty is that guys that take easier shots (especially the superstars) more times than not are just able to create easy shots for themselves.</p>

<p>Centers by posting up for instance or guards and wings with their handle, throwing the other guy off.</p>

<p>Or just being more physically dominant or taller.</p>

<p>KD can just straight up shoot over guys so most of his shots come easier than it would for someone like Booker in the same situation.</p>

<p>Also just knowing when and when not to take a shot.</p>

      <label for="lnbswop" class="commentText"><p>Sometimes, you just need to make a bucket out of nothing. Say the set play breaks down, and there&rsquo;s 8 left on the shot clock. Some players thrive in those situations, but those are gonna be lower percentage shots than set plays. An advanced stat that measures shot difficulty will be helpful in determining who you can count on for a contested bucket.</p>

      <label for="lnbvhep" class="commentText"><p>But really good players just go and make an easy shot for themselves.</p>

<p>Giannis goes downhill and just cant be stoped or Jokic posts a guy up and get to an easy floater or KD  dribles a bit, gets to his spot and makes the shot.</p>

<p>Now what you say has some merit, but realisticly the best players dont take that many bad shots often in general.</p>

      <label for="lnbw0h7" class="commentText"><p>True, but you have to admit Jokic running a play designed for his strength probably yields higher field goal percentage than him playing some desperation end of shot clock one-on-one, right?</p>

<p>This theoretical stat would identify the best players at creating something out of nothing. Would not be surprised if Jokic was on there, or Kyrie and Kobe, who also happen to be some of the best players. Would also not be surprised if players who aren&rsquo;t considered overall greats also score high, like Jamal Crawford.</p>

<p>There really isnt anything you can get out of them in all honesty other than which guy can shoot best.</p>

<p>And i dont really see Kobe being super high up there. He took a ton of those shots and made a ton too, so people have this image of him being great at them. But he missed probably even more of those.</p>

<p>And Kobe might have a worse percentage in these situations vs his regular percentage, but I bet he&rsquo;d be better than most. We won&rsquo;t know since this stat doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>I like how you used Book here too. Because Book takes the same shots as KD despite being so much smaller and it&rsquo;s barely harder because of his playstyle and jump shot.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s actually pretty interesting thinking about it.</p>

      <label for="lnbv2en" class="commentText"><p>Yeah people dont really think about it much, but in general how tough your shot is to take depends on who is guarding your, where you are on the court and just your ability to get open.</p>

<p>Getting easy shots is a skill in and of itself and a defenders true value is in how hard they can make a shot for the guy they defend.</p>

<p>Kyrie is a guy that takes some of the hardest shots in the league. Yes his drible is insane and he can get past guys quite well with it, but he doesnt actually open himself up for easy shots. Instead he just takes and makes really tough ones.</p>

<p>Which fair enough, the dude can make some insanely tough shots, but his handle wouldnt be half as effective if he couldnt make those acrobatic finishes of his.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth examining this statement.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s true that sometimes basketball relies on tough shot making, it also reduces the <em>benefits</em> of tough shot-making to individual metrics, which cuts out the <em>team benefit</em> of the kinds of things you&rsquo;re trying to describe.</p>

<p>Like, a <a href="https://perthirtysix.com/nba/player-shot-chart?season=2014_regular&amp;playerOneId=2594&amp;playerTwoId=201939&amp;dayRange=0_170&amp;distanceRange=0_40&amp;streakRange=-5_5&amp;shotTypes=100_101_102_103_104_105_106_200_201_202_203_204_300_301_302_303_401_402_403&amp;shotMetadataTypes=101_102_201_202_301_302_401_402_501_502_503_504_505&amp;chartType=hexbin" target="_blank">deep Steph 3 in 2015 is different from a Korver corner 3</a> not because hitting a deep 3 is worth more than a corner 3, but because a deep 3 in 2015 from the main ballhandler is (1) easier/faster to get than an action designed to get the corner open, (2) causes the defense to stretch out and creates more space for teammates, and (3) can happen from more parts of the floor, so the defense can&rsquo;t scheme to take it away in the same way.</p>

<p>So these things are going to ultimately be expressed in things like offensive rating or team efficiency <em>and</em> in the fact that the Warriors combined their best ballhandler and shooter into one guy also allowed them to field the best defense in the NBA that year.</p>

<p>Like, I think you could make a metric that could measure how good a guy is at making contested shots, how accurate they are in late shot clock situations, weight that stuff based on shot distance to try and include overall spacing considerations, etc. (I think there&rsquo;s some shooting metric from some 3rd party company, but their results from last season raised some question, so I can&rsquo;t speak to it&rsquo;s quality). But a metric won&rsquo;t necessarily indicate players who are <em>better</em>, it&rsquo;ll just describe a particular skill.</p>

<p>Like, I&rsquo;m sure a metric like that would probably <em>really</em> like DeMar DeRozan over the last few years, but the long run of his career has shown that, while his skill set is super useful in particular situations, the overall team offense impact of your best scorer being that guy isn&rsquo;t really all that great ultimately.</p>

      <label for="lnbom43" class="commentText"><p>Obviously there are limits like the ones you mentioned, and different players will find different shots more difficult. Other commenters brought up factors we can account for, such as distance, how closely the shot was contested, whether the shot came off the dribble or pass, whether the shot was assisted or created without help, etc.</p>

<p>I guess we can compare a player’s accuracy in these different situations to the league average to see how far above average a player’s success rate is when different factors are taken into account.</p>

      <label for="lnc1nyi" class="commentText"><p>I’d think looking for uncontested shots or less difficult shots is a reflection of basketball IQ and basketball skill for basketball players. After all, 2 points are 2 points regardless how difficult they are. From the day the game was invented, it was a contest to score more points and it’s never the difficulty of these shots or points scored.</p>

      <label for="lnbmavz" class="commentText"><p>What you&rsquo;re asking for is a functionally useless statistic. You don&rsquo;t score more points by shooting with 3 people guarding you than by shooting wide open. What matters is if they go in or not, and how often you make them go in or not. Obviously Curry is better than Korver, but that&rsquo;s because of a combination of volume and efficiency, not just efficiency and not just volume.</p>

<p>Now if you care about volume + efficiency you can look at &lsquo;TS added&rsquo; and &lsquo;eFG added&rsquo;, which shows you how many points they created vs. an average scorer that year. It won&rsquo;t absolve poor volume scorers from their sins, but it will put into perspective how great guys like Jokic and Curry are.</p>

      <label for="lnbrv6o" class="commentText"><p>I would disagree that this type of analysis would be useless for several reasons.</p>

<p>First, in certain key situations (ex. down 3 with &amp;lt;2 seconds left) a coach might rather draw up a play for a shooter who is known to be more effective shooting a heavily contested catch and shoot due to his athleticism despite his teammate being a more accurate 3pt shooter overall.</p>

<p>Next, a player who can score using a variety of different shots in different situations adds more value to the team. There are lots of bench players who are just as good as anyone shooting a stand-still 3 in practice. But part of the reason some of them don’t see the floor in the final minutes of a close game is that they aren’t nearly as effective as creating and making difficult shots as the players ahead of them in the rotation. A player who can make different types of “tough” shots also offers certain strategic advantages beyond style and the psychological effect on the defense. For example, players who can shoot deep 3s can stretch the floor and for that reason can use their gravity to help get other players open, as well as have an easier time accelerating past their defender who cannot give them an inch of space. Another example is an iso with 5 seconds to go in the shot clock, where a more creative/athletic player will be more effective than a spot up specialist. Hope this provides more clarity on the thought process here!</p>

The shot you take should be in line with a shot you are efficient at if you want to be great. What we do know is that if you make those shots at certain percentages it makes you &ldquo;great&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t make them, then you aren&rsquo;t as great. You can toss up all kinds of garbage and chuck all day, it doesn&rsquo;t matter and nobody cares.</p>
