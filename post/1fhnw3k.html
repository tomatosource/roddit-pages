      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fhnw3k/is_there_an_advanced_stat_that_takes_difficulty/"><p>Is there an advanced stat that takes difficulty level of shot attempts into account?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’m curious if there are any analytics or advanced stat that would account for the degree of difficulty involved in different attempts of the same shot type (e.g. a contested step back 3 from 26 ft out vs an open 22 ft corner 3 in transition)? I think a metric like this could help people look beyond percentages to show why certain players are more valuable despite having lower FG or 3pt percentages.</p>

<p>For example, in the 2014-15 regular season, Kyle Korver was the leader in 3 point percentage at 49.2%. Steph Curry, the leader in total 3PM for the season and that season’s MVP, was 3rd at 44.3%. Despite Korver being 4.9% more accurate from 3, I would argue that Curry was still more valuable that season as a 3 point shooter because he took deeper attempts, created those shots off the dribble more often than Korver, and converted more heavily contested shots later in the shot clock. Do we have a metric that takes these factors into account to determine which players are making more difficult shots?</p>

<p>TLDR - Which analytics take degree of difficulty into account when determining who is a better shooter?</p>

      <label for="lnbh0cl" class="commentText"><p>I dunno, but it seems a bit pointless to me.</p>

<p>The thing about shot dificulty is that guys that take easier shots (especially the superstars) more times than not are just able to create easy shots for themselves.</p>

<p>Centers by posting up for instance or guards and wings with their handle, throwing the other guy off.</p>

<p>Or just being more physically dominant or taller.</p>

<p>KD can just straight up shoot over guys so most of his shots come easier than it would for someone like Booker in the same situation.</p>

<p>Also just knowing when and when not to take a shot.</p>

      <label for="lnbmavz" class="commentText"><p>What you&rsquo;re asking for is a functionally useless statistic. You don&rsquo;t score more points by shooting with 3 people guarding you than by shooting wide open. What matters is if they go in or not, and how often you make them go in or not. Obviously Curry is better than Korver, but that&rsquo;s because of a combination of volume and efficiency, not just efficiency and not just volume.</p>

<p>Now if you care about volume + efficiency you can look at &lsquo;TS added&rsquo; and &lsquo;eFG added&rsquo;, which shows you how many points they created vs. an average scorer that year. It won&rsquo;t absolve poor volume scorers from their sins, but it will put into perspective how great guys like Jokic and Curry are.</p>

      <label for="lnbfqcy" class="commentText"><p>Oh lord lol is this another Kobe stan trying to elevate his mediocre FG%? It never stops. The shot you take should be in line with a shot you are efficient at if you want to be great. What we do know is that if you make those shots at certain percentages it makes you &ldquo;great&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t make them, then you aren&rsquo;t as great. You can toss up all kinds of garbage and chuck all day, it doesn&rsquo;t matter and nobody cares.</p>
