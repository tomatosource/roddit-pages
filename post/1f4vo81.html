      <label for="lko7kdr" class="commentText"><p>She’s right, this is the relevant part of the rules:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pivot foot may be lifted, but not returned to the playing court, before the ball is released on a pass or try for goal;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She can’t bring her pivot foot back down to the court before shooting (or passing), but she didn’t.</p>

<p>Having said that, growing up I always thought that shit was a walk too tbh, just like KG. I learned never to pick up your pivot foot at all once it’s planted. But by the rule book, you can.</p>

It’s not taught as a travel in any level of sports by rule. It’s simply misinformation from coaches and outside influences.

      <label for="lkonnh0" class="commentText"><p>It has always been legal, but until the last 5 years or so most NBA players (like KG in this clip) were playing the way you mentioned, that lifting your pivot foot first creates a new pivot foot and is thus a travel. That&rsquo;s why on stopped plays when trying to shake a defender, even when they did a partial step through, they still at least tried and jump off both feet at the same time (Look at the Dream Shake, and now imagine instead of just planting his off foot and jumping, he took a full step through. Would basically have been able to dunk).</p>

<p>Back in the day you would almost never see full step throughs off a stopped play (not counting straight up layups). We are going to see a LOT more full step throughs in the future now that players fully understand the rule, and it will be so much harder to prevent a player from getting a shot off.</p>

      <label for="lkoh055" class="commentText"><p>To me that’s more of a gather I can wrap my small brain around. You can take two steps after the gather, eg for a dunk or layup. I think the gather is reasonable enough even if still mildly murky, this one just strikes me as a sort of gather to the layup from a static post-up, though I guess more appropriately called a step-through.</p>

<p>But a lot of us probably due to high school ball (this is ancient for me, over 20 years ago) were conditioned that the pivot foot should stay basically glued to the floor unless you’re jumping off both feet.</p>

      <label for="lkoofgq" class="commentText"><p>To be honest I&rsquo;m an old head and played like your brothers. I agree now that the rule does allow step throughs, but it just makes it way too easy for the offensive player. With no step through you&rsquo;ve got like a 3 foot radius of shot to defend, but with a full step through the offensive player is getting another 5 feet in any direction (think how far you can step with one foot and jump). Games already too easy for offense.</p>

      <label for="lkok34j" class="commentText"><p>The problem I have with it, in my own head, is that once the other foot it set down, and the pivot is lifted FIRST, then it is now establishing the foot you’re jumping off as a pivot foot. Changing the pivot is a travel.</p>

<p>During a layup, you’re gathering and jumping while moving. You have not stopped and established a pivot. Once you’ve stopped and established, that pivot foot can leave the ground for a shot or pass, but jumping off the other foot once stopped is changing the pivot.</p>

<p>I’m ok with the game changing over time, and this being now established as not a travel, but my old ass can’t do it without feeing like I’m traveling, and still won’t do it instinctually, because that’s not how I grew up playing.</p>

I dont know when this changed, but all over the world you see players make this move like in the clip and its not a travel anymore. My instincts still always tell me that its a travel though lol.</p>

Otherwise jump shots and two step layups would be illegal. People were misinformed about the rule, but the rule has never changed. It’s always been legal in FIBA as they share the same definition of a travel as the NBA and College and High School Ball. Now the only difference is the NBA has a gather step.

<p>This rule was only applicable to jump stops when we were taught it as kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/5XrbKIdbf0o?t=25" target="_blank">Dirk Nowitzki&rsquo;</a>s classic turnaround fade-away was sometimes done off a pivot where the pivot foot is first into the air. Parker&rsquo;s jump in the above is pretty much simultaneous between both feet.</p>

      <label for="lkohxk3" class="commentText"><p>The issue is switching feet.  Let’s say you’re at the 3PT line jab stepping with your right foot (left is pivot).  Is it ok for you to step in the direction you’re jabbing placing all of your weight on your right foot (while picking your left foot up) without dribbling, then shooting?  That’d be called a travel 100 out of 100 times.</p>

      <label for="lko8qp4" class="commentText"><p>It’s called a step-through and it’s been perfectly legal for a while but honestly it wasn’t until pretty recently that we’ve seen guys like Luka and Shai really take advantage of it.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that Luka’s step-through, in particular, is often SOOOOOO SLOW and deliberate looking so I’ve seen many many many more casual fans react negatively to it and cry violation. I understand their perspective and honestly it can leave defenses helpless at times.</p>

<p>If you go back and watch the mid range post up game employed by guys like Kobe and MJ you’ll see this pivot foot lifted for a move to free up space and shoot very often but they’re so athletic and smooth that it can be hard to really discern in real time.</p>

<p>Lmao there’s also tons of footage of KG doing it after his signature shimmy so it honestly makes him look way worse here.</p>

<p>Based on the actual rules, technically, I guess you could step through to your off-foot and one-footed flamingo for as long as you can keep your balance without it being a travel (as long as you get rid of the ball before your pivot foot comes back down).</p>

I would be in favor of changing the rules so that 1. a step through on a layup/drive is fine (otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t have layups), 2. once you are stopped, your pivot foot should be the last thing to leave the ground, or same time as your other foot. Having a full step through just gives the stopped player way too much range to get off a shot. The game already favors offense enough.</p>

<p>That’s what it is—her right foot is her pivot, then she picks it up with her left foot on the ground, and technically it’s not a travel until her right comes back to the ground. They taught us for years you can’t move your pivot, and then in the last 15 years, it’s felt like 1) the euro step and 2) the nba made a conscious decision to make the game more aesthetically pleasing on offense and give more weapons to the individual player, so they interpreted the rule differently.</p>

<p>I play a lot of basketball and a few weeks ago, my pick up team was playing a group of high school kids, maybe sophomores/juniors. A friend told me, “wrap this shit up quick so we can play you again.” The kids SMOKED us because none of us could guard them on the perimeter. It was 5 out, all one on one, and dribble drive kick or finish. It was after that game that I said, fuck, things have completely changed and I’m going to be a role player the rest of my life because I do not have it like these young guys lol</p>

<p>The players today train the nuances so well that it’s impossible to play defense. They’re going to have to change defensive rules, ie you can hand check or defensive 3 in the key, because it’s so unfair right now. It’s happened across all sports because of the advent of fantasy and tv and lower attention spans—they think fans want scoring and offense, and it was cool for a minute, but man do I think it’s gone so far the other way.</p>

<p>Another way of thinking about it, what if she went through the motion of the step through and didn’t actually shoot? Like now her left foot is on the ground and her initial pivot foot (right) is in the air. Can she just stand like that because she technically didn’t return her pivot foot to the ground?

I don’t play basketball with people who don’t know the rules tho and I don’t let people bully me with opinions they can’t prove so 🤷🏾‍♂️ whether people know the rules or not doesn’t change the rules.</p>

You couldn&rsquo;t Eurostep, that was also a travel for dragging your back foot.  It&rsquo;s not like nobody had the idea to Eurostep until the 2000s.  It just wasn&rsquo;t legal.  My buddy did that in high school practice this one time, insisting it was two steps, and we all laughed him out of the gym.  Dragging your back foot, travelling, bzzt.</p>

<p>edit: I guess you guys are right.  I had to watch some Kevin McHale to convince myself.  I swore McHale was travelling every time, too, then, so maybe this tracks.</p>

      <label for="lkobdhw" class="commentText"><p>She planted her non-pivot foot before she lifted her pivot foot up. You&rsquo;re allowed to lift your pivot foot to shoot or pass. If you think otherwise, you think that every jumpshot after ending your dribble is a travel.</p>
