      <label for="l79ljbx" class="commentText"><p>Zach Lowe has spoken about it a couple times in his podcast.</p>

<p>This post has the headline about how Russ set exactly ZERO screens for Carmelo when they were together</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=1" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=1</a></p>

<p>This article has some counts for when Russ was on the Lakers (also quoting Lowe)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/lakers/news/lakers-news-russell-westbrook-refused-to-regularly-set-screens-for-lebron-james-rm94" target="_blank">https://www.si.com/nba/lakers/news/lakers-news-russell-westbrook-refused-to-regularly-set-screens-for-lebron-james-rm94</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;You can tell they had a team meeting about Russ screening for LeBron before the second game of the season against the Memphis Grizzlies. Screened 8 times for Lebron in that game, it worked pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that game, here are the number of ball screens Russ set in the 6 subsequent games, this is from Second Spectrum 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1. He did not set more than 2 in a basketball game in which the professional Los Angeles Lakers were involved until March. He didn’t set more than 4 in any other game in the entire season.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l79ztf4" class="commentText"><p>Horrible take. You’re nuts. Smart was a great team player. Some fans just can’t get over the negativity bias from his bad 3 nights.</p>

<p>Jrue is just a better player on a better team who better fits on this slightly different team. Our whole starting 5, including Jrue is shooting 40% from 3 (career high and he shot 35% last season). Smart shot 32% last season and probably would have done better on this team.</p>

<p>And Smart’s last season he shot almost the exact same amount of 3s as Jrue did this season with us. The narrative that Smart played selfishly is just insane. We’re better this year for a ton of reasons and have yet to play a single decent team due to injuries.</p>

<p>Wild to see any C’s fan call Smart selfish after what an outstanding team player he was. May all your Dunkin’s hot regular coffees turn to ashes in your mouth.</p>

<p>Basketball has such an individualized narrative for such a team sport.  A stud can carry, but only so far (e.g. LeBron 2007 or 2015).  An elite individual putting a team on his back very rarely overcomes an elite team at the NBA level.  I&rsquo;d love to see what prime Dame could do with prime Shaq, for example.</p>

      <label for="l7ac98r" class="commentText"><p>Fact is winning a championship is really really hard. Lot of moments have to go your way. One loss could completely reshape your career legacy. Imagine if the 08 celtics lost in 7 to the Hawks? All 3 guys legacies are completely different. You often get injury luck as well. Almost a test of who the healthiest team is rather than the best team some times.</p>

      <label for="l7a6oxu" class="commentText"><p>This is just pointless shade. By that argument, Jordan&rsquo;s success was &ldquo;mostly luck.&rdquo; He had the three-headed monster at center, Pippen, Kerr, Rodman, Grant, etc.</p>

<p>If Kobe had only won chips with Shaq - <em>the</em> most dominant player at the time and perhaps all-time at his peak - then maybe an argument could be made.</p>

<p>Kobe won two chips as the centerpiece on his own. Of course, Gasol is a legend and the supporting class was fantastic as well. &ldquo;Mostly luck&rdquo; is just one of those bitter, casual hot takes.</p>

<p>They are counting his cuts off screens he sets, so it&rsquo;s kind of a weird stat maybe cuz I don&rsquo;t think they count the screens he sets, but doesn&rsquo;t cut off from? I dunno.</p>

<p>Curry was the pindown king in the regular season, leading the league in total cuts off of those screens by a huge margin</p>

      <label for="l79ldx2" class="commentText"><p>I would be curious as well. Best I could find was screen assists. He ranks 11th on the clippers in terms of screen assists per game. To be fair to WB he has twice as many per game as harden, .4 vs .2 lol.

      <label for="l79phdz" class="commentText"><p>Follow up. This is actually a large increase in screen assists for Westbrook from when he was a star. In his last season with the Thunder WB got a total of 11 screen assists in 80 games. Which rounds to .1 per game lol. Also among guards, it seems that everyone&rsquo;s favorite player Ben Simmons is the goat of screen assists. Averaging 2.9 screen assists per game this year, over twice as much as second place at 1.1 (Curry). Last year despite playing only 42 games Simmons had nearly twice as many total screen assists as second-place, with 117 vs 60. Don&rsquo;t yell at me that he&rsquo;s not a guard it&rsquo;s not my classification system lol.</p>

      <label for="l79doy4" class="commentText"><p>Similar to NFL when WRs/RBs know they aren’t getting the ball, they help give away the type of play they’re running. Certain players don’t know how to play off ball and understand how they can help without the ball. Should appreciate players like Curry, is always moving without the ball, running all around or relocating while being chased. The endurance on this man cannot be said enough. No other superstars expend that kind of energy when they ain’t getting the ball.</p>

He&rsquo;s good enough and established enough that he could realistically decide he wants to play like Houston James Harden and just iso or run in PnR all game and he&rsquo;d still be really really good and it&rsquo;s not like the coaches or front office could really say shit to him at this point in his career. But the team wouldn&rsquo;t be as good if he did that so he still cuts and screens and never stops moving like he&rsquo;s some spot up specialist whose only chance at a bucket is running through three screens to get a catch and shoot.</p>

      <label for="l79mt76" class="commentText"><p>Not just that, the warriors offense is predicated on misdirection, curry knows even if he doesn’t get the ball, if he runs around, he’s gonna attract so much attention and it’s still gonna fuck up the defence. Imagine if the harden rockets had even a quarter of this.</p>

      <label for="l79u6oz" class="commentText"><p>Curry&rsquo;s screening is such an underrated part of his game that not many guys his size are willing to do, and his screening is so particularly valuable because of how threatening his shooting is to defenses.</p>

<p>Like even Klay and even when Durant was on the Warriors, those guys didn&rsquo;t set nearly the same amount of screens as Steph did, and neither of them had the kind of activity and motor that he had off-ball.</p>

<p>Dray and Steph are really similar in the fact that they both do so many little things that don&rsquo;t show up in the box score, but in Steph&rsquo;s case it&rsquo;s offensively, and in Dray&rsquo;s case it&rsquo;s defensively. Think this is part of the reason why Steph and Dray consistently looked like outliers on their teams and in the league during their prime in plus-minus/impact based metrics. A noticeable chunk of their value that they add to their teams come from stuff that is not picked up by the box score.</p>

<p>Turns out, LeBron was more prepared. Arenas spent off days during the series at LeBron’s house, where he and James’s crew played cards, talked shit, and gambled. Meanwhile, LeBron was nearby, watching game film. “[It] was like watching a machine absorb information,” Arenas remembers.</p>

Of course the story concludes with MJ continuing to shoot and eventually turning it around but let&rsquo;s not pretend he was mister 100% preparation. It&rsquo;s honestly part of what makes his dominance so insane, he was way better than all of his peers while also producing legendary partying and gambling stories at the same time.</p>

But his parents were super rich, nice pool and hot tub, every video game release, surround sound movie theater (with 16 chairs), etc.  This is a kid who was lucky to play 2-3 minutes a game. But his dad owned a popular business, was on the school board, a big-Whig in town. </p>

<p>He would always house 3-4 of the best players of the opposing team. Start off with Mexican food for dinner, a bunch of spicy tacos and enchiladas, tamales. And would sneak tons of booze and cigars down to his floor of the house. And these dudes would get hammered, smoke cigars, sit in the hot tub forever, play videos games until 3-4 on the morning.  </p>

<p>It was pretty hilarious as even the local sports editor called it the “my hometown” Curse.  It happened so many times. We would lose the Friday night game but then always come back and win the Saturday night game by 20 points. Lol because half their studs would be wore out and hungover. </p>

      <label for="l7amhwl" class="commentText"><p>My problem with his is I feel like his finishing game relied so much on speed and explosiveness he just never had finesse. Like this sound crazy to say but he is not great at layups. There’s no finesse no ball spin so when the athleticism was gone it was just him throwing the ball off of the backboard. Compare that to Kyrie.</p>

      <label for="l7a9uj3" class="commentText"><p>He only had 100 &amp; 0. This post makes it out like selfishness, and there is some of that esp with his shot selection, but really I think he only had the two modes across the board. His rim finishing suffered because there was no deceleration under control, just 100% full send. It&rsquo;s not so simple of an adjustment because it would actually require a lot of additional skills. He had the bbiq to be a brilliant passer, but it feels like it never went beyond that to soundness in reading the overall action on offense and defense, or not taking bad shots. Very much like AI in that way except he was a better passer &amp; defender.</p>

In interviews, he’s always like “I’ll play the same way no matter who the opponent is” and sometimes I thought, there in lies the problem.</p>

He had <strong>a lot</strong> of off shooting nights, but most players who really want to win (like Kobe did) was that they would hustle a little harder, set harder screens, start moving off ball&hellip;if their shots weren&rsquo;t falling. Westbrook did not care to do the little things, he just wanted the ball and wanted to win or lose his own way.</p>

<p>But my god he was a hard watch this playoffs. Looked like he had the yips out there, couldnt even finish layups. When he can’t exploit a defender sagging off him he just has to come off ngl.</p>

<p>That being said hes being paid a vet min. if he’s not doing well he shouldn’t be playing and def not starting. Has to be a depth issue right? Or do we just blame lue atp. but i don’t get paid millions to coach so i wouldn’t know better.</p>

      <label for="l79zw5w" class="commentText"><p>Not inexplicable, although it is strange. The reason for his FT% drop was the free throw shot clock. If you go watch his free throw ritual before the FT shot clock. He would catch the ball from the ref and walk all the way to half court, touch the half court line and walk back slowly with the ball at his hip then shoot the free throw. It was ridiculous, but for some reason this worked for him.</p>

<p>The season the FT shot clock was introduced and he was no longer allowed to do his long ritual before every FT his FT% dropped. He has acknowledged it and it would seem to be entirely a mental thing, but he&rsquo;s never been able to replicate his success with his old long-ass ritual.</p>

      <label for="l7a5wk5" class="commentText"><p>I wonder does he have a personal PG coach or consultation PG.  It is sad to see if he just had some better decision making he&rsquo;d probably have a championship. He has all the physical tools of course.  Stats and effort are amazing, but Tony Allen&rsquo;s quote here shows the decision making and style of play has obvious flaws.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if he averages 50 a game and you don&rsquo;t make the game winning plays and decisions down the stretch. You can have the 50 and other teams/players will take the win.</p>

<p>Most promising he played to me may have been the final GS series before KD left. That OKC team looked amazing, the 3-1 lead, he seemed to be picking his spots better in the first half or so of the series.</p>
