      <label for="l79ljbx" class="commentText"><p>Zach Lowe has spoken about it a couple times in his podcast.</p>

<p>This post has the headline about how Russ set exactly ZERO screens for Carmelo when they were together</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=1" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=1</a></p>

<p>This article has some counts for when Russ was on the Lakers (also quoting Lowe)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/lakers/news/lakers-news-russell-westbrook-refused-to-regularly-set-screens-for-lebron-james-rm94" target="_blank">https://www.si.com/nba/lakers/news/lakers-news-russell-westbrook-refused-to-regularly-set-screens-for-lebron-james-rm94</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;You can tell they had a team meeting about Russ screening for LeBron before the second game of the season against the Memphis Grizzlies. Screened 8 times for Lebron in that game, it worked pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that game, here are the number of ball screens Russ set in the 6 subsequent games, this is from Second Spectrum 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1. He did not set more than 2 in a basketball game in which the professional Los Angeles Lakers were involved until March. He didn’t set more than 4 in any other game in the entire season.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l79ztf4" class="commentText"><p>Horrible take. You’re nuts. Smart was a great team player. Some fans just can’t get over the negativity bias from his bad 3 nights.</p>

<p>Jrue is just a better player on a better team who better fits on this slightly different team. Our whole starting 5, including Jrue is shooting 40% from 3 (career high and he shot 35% last season). Smart shot 32% last season and probably would have done better on this team.</p>

<p>And Smart’s last season he shot almost the exact same amount of 3s as Jrue did this season with us. The narrative that Smart played selfishly is just insane. We’re better this year for a ton of reasons and have yet to play a single decent team due to injuries.</p>

<p>Wild to see any C’s fan call Smart selfish after what an outstanding team player he was. May all your Dunkin’s hot regular coffees turn to ashes in your mouth.</p>

But he would often times try to be the hero and make the bucket when he has 2 better scoring options in Tatum and Brown.

<p>Basketball has such an individualized narrative for such a team sport.  A stud can carry, but only so far (e.g. LeBron 2007 or 2015).  An elite individual putting a team on his back very rarely overcomes an elite team at the NBA level.  I&rsquo;d love to see what prime Dame could do with prime Shaq, for example.</p>

<p>If Kobe had only won chips with Shaq - <em>the</em> most dominant player at the time and perhaps all-time at his peak - then maybe an argument could be made.</p>

<p>Kobe won two chips as the centerpiece on his own. Of course, Gasol is a legend and the supporting class was fantastic as well. &ldquo;Mostly luck&rdquo; is just one of those bitter, casual hot takes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it as a criticism of Shaq, but just that while Russ may have had some &lsquo;unbelievable natural ability&rsquo; he was also known for putting in the time off the court, which is admirable too.</p>

      <label for="l79xv22" class="commentText"><p>Yeah Russ clearly works hard and is in incredible shape. The criticism of him is that he didn’t develop his game more with his ability to shoot, play off the ball, and play more disciplined defense.</p>

<p>So much of his game relies on out athleting the other team. He obviously worked hard to develop those physical tools but the big what if is if he had put more energy into the mental/technical side of the game?</p>

<p>With a different mindset he could have been an all time great. But just like Shaq it’s hard to criticize too much because they ended up with better careers than 99%+ of all nba players.</p>

      <label for="l79y76h" class="commentText"><p>yeah i would regret it if people took that as i think russ and shaq had the same work ethic. i dont. but its interesting to look at the two and see how the source of their issue was ultimately something ego-based and then it resulted in them not establishing themselves into a player that could play well into their 30s.</p>

<p>I really think both of them never really thought that far ahead. Its probably so easy to feel like you will always be this dominant at what you do. Then one day you arent and it was never up to you when that happens.</p>

      <label for="l7a8wxi" class="commentText"><p>Shaq didn&rsquo;t start really declining to being less than a clear All-Star until he was 35, and he was willing to not be the guy anymore. He deferred to Wade and won a championship. He had good longevity, and the idea that he didn&rsquo;t is just not true. He played for 19 years and was an All-Star 15 times and All-NBA 14 times.</p>

<p>Westbrook has been an obvious negative on the court for at least the past three years, and he&rsquo;s only 35. Moreover, his obsession with triple doubles and just general decision making made him questionable for a few years prior, despite his box score stats. He&rsquo;s closer to Iverson than he is to Shaq. Electrifying athletic guards whose game was inefficient and whose egos made them resistant to being anything other than the guy.</p>

If you’re Russ’s man, you can leave him open off ball and don’t have to worry about being forced to think about a screen.</p>

<p>They are counting his cuts off screens he sets, so it&rsquo;s kind of a weird stat maybe cuz I don&rsquo;t think they count the screens he sets, but doesn&rsquo;t cut off from? I dunno.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Curry was the pindown king in the regular season, leading the league in total cuts off of those screens by a huge margin</p>

<p>TLDR, Curry sets a bunch of screens.</p>

I mean Curry setting an off-ball screen for Klay was terrifying because you couldn&rsquo;t leave either of them.</p>

<p>My guess is that LeBron was hoping Russ would be a willing screener like Kyrie. The Lebron/Kyrie PNR was good enough for Zach Lowe to write an entire article about it</p>

      <label for="l79on60" class="commentText"><p>The crazy part is that for how much he loves driving, he could have been part of a good PnR but reversed role of a guard setting for a big and then rolling to the basket. That actually doesn’t seem so far fetched to me cause he was a decent kick out passer if they collapsed.</p>

      <label for="l79ldx2" class="commentText"><p>I would be curious as well. Best I could find was screen assists. He ranks 11th on the clippers in terms of screen assists per game. To be fair to WB he has twice as many per game as harden, .4 vs .2 lol.

      <label for="l79phdz" class="commentText"><p>Follow up. This is actually a large increase in screen assists for Westbrook from when he was a star. In his last season with the Thunder WB got a total of 11 screen assists in 80 games. Which rounds to .1 per game lol. Also among guards, it seems that everyone&rsquo;s favorite player Ben Simmons is the goat of screen assists. Averaging 2.9 screen assists per game this year, over twice as much as second place at 1.1 (Curry). Last year despite playing only 42 games Simmons had nearly twice as many total screen assists as second-place, with 117 vs 60. Don&rsquo;t yell at me that he&rsquo;s not a guard it&rsquo;s not my classification system lol.</p>

      <label for="l79doy4" class="commentText"><p>Similar to NFL when WRs/RBs know they aren’t getting the ball, they help give away the type of play they’re running. Certain players don’t know how to play off ball and understand how they can help without the ball. Should appreciate players like Curry, is always moving without the ball, running all around or relocating while being chased. The endurance on this man cannot be said enough. No other superstars expend that kind of energy when they ain’t getting the ball.</p>

      <label for="l79u6oz" class="commentText"><p>Curry&rsquo;s screening is such an underrated part of his game that not many guys his size are willing to do, and his screening is so particularly valuable because of how threatening his shooting is to defenses.</p>

<p>Like even Klay and even when Durant was on the Warriors, those guys didn&rsquo;t set nearly the same amount of screens as Steph did, and neither of them had the kind of activity and motor that he had off-ball.</p>

<p>Dray and Steph are really similar in the fact that they both do so many little things that don&rsquo;t show up in the box score, but in Steph&rsquo;s case it&rsquo;s offensively, and in Dray&rsquo;s case it&rsquo;s defensively. Think this is part of the reason why Steph and Dray consistently looked like outliers on their teams and in the league during their prime in plus-minus/impact based metrics. A noticeable chunk of their value that they add to their teams come from stuff that is not picked up by the box score.</p>

He&rsquo;s good enough and established enough that he could realistically decide he wants to play like Houston James Harden and just iso or run in PnR all game and he&rsquo;d still be really really good and it&rsquo;s not like the coaches or front office could really say shit to him at this point in his career. But the team wouldn&rsquo;t be as good if he did that so he still cuts and screens and never stops moving like he&rsquo;s some spot up specialist whose only chance at a bucket is running through three screens to get a catch and shoot.</p>

<p>people talk about him being unable to finish at the rim on the Lakers yet his FG% at the rim in LA was better than his OKC career. he&rsquo;s never been a good finisher</p>

<p>But my god he was a hard watch this playoffs. Looked like he had the yips out there, couldnt even finish layups. When he can’t exploit a defender sagging off him he just has to come off ngl.</p>

<p>That being said hes being paid a vet min. if he’s not doing well he shouldn’t be playing and def not starting. Has to be a depth issue right? Or do we just blame lue atp. but i don’t get paid millions to coach so i wouldn’t know better.</p>

      <label for="l79zw5w" class="commentText"><p>Not inexplicable, although it is strange. The reason for his FT% drop was the free throw shot clock. If you go watch his free throw ritual before the FT shot clock. He would catch the ball from the ref and walk all the way to half court, touch the half court line and walk back slowly with the ball at his hip then shoot the free throw. It was ridiculous, but for some reason this worked for him.</p>

<p>The season the FT shot clock was introduced and he was no longer allowed to do his long ritual before every FT his FT% dropped. He has acknowledged it and it would seem to be entirely a mental thing, but he&rsquo;s never been able to replicate his success with his old long-ass ritual.</p>

      <label for="l79m4v7" class="commentText"><p>I know this whole thread is a circle jerk against Westbrook, but that Lakers rim FG% point lacks so much context</p>

<p>This comment here explains it well</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/n11OXCBcbe" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/n11OXCBcbe</a></p>

<p>Essentially, he’s not being guarded as tightly as on OKC and doesn’t collapse the defense as well as he did in his prime. If he got as much attention as he did in ‘16, his finishing would be way worse on the Lakers</p>

<p>But I doubt you guys care, you just find whatever stat fits your narrative and run with it. Thinking Lakers Westbrook is the same guy as he was during his prime is silly.</p>

<p>Stats like RAPTOR, EPM….etc. showcase that, you can even look at his on-offs from 2012-2017 and it’ll tell you the same thing</p>

      <label for="l79pa8l" class="commentText"><p>15-16 is the defining Russell Westbrook year. His prime was legit. Beat an elite Spurs team (one of the higher net ratings in history) then took 3 off a superteam. He had better playoff on/off than KD that year. If those 3 games had just been in a different order, his legacy would be completely different. Harden, of course, did the exact same thing, 3 games off a superteam and it is frequently brought up as his pinnacle achievement.</p>

From 2010 to 2022, the FG% at the rim league wide went from like 60% to 67%. So Russ was still just as bad as he always was, the league just got better around him.</p>

<p>I’m not defending Arenas here, but for the kind of player he was, he did what he could do and that probably doesn’t take as much prep as someone running the offense. It’s just getting to your spots.</p>

He’s been very open about Vogel being fired because of Westbrook and not AD or LeBron. The FO tied themselves to Westbrook and desperately tried to make it work. They brought in Ham but that didn’t help, either. If they hadn’t fucked up that trade, he’d probably still be the coach of the Lakers.</p>

      <label for="l7a9uj3" class="commentText"><p>He only had 100 &amp; 0. This post makes it out like selfishness, and there is some of that esp with his shot selection, but really I think he only had the two modes across the board. His rim finishing suffered because there was no deceleration under control, just 100% full send. It&rsquo;s not so simple of an adjustment because it would actually require a lot of additional skills. He had the bbiq to be a brilliant passer, but it feels like it never went beyond that to soundness in reading the overall action on offense and defense, or not taking bad shots. Very much like AI in that way except he was a better passer &amp; defender.</p>
