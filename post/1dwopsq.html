      <label for="lbvyuht" class="commentText"><p>Yea, the prevailing narrative around him should have shifted this year. His shooting was legit good, like you said, especially for the types of shots he&rsquo;s taking. He&rsquo;s only getting better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sold on him as a PG yet, which it seems the Magic are heading in that direction, but Paolo could play that role more and the Magic have like 2-3 PG&rsquo;s on their bench as well. Suggs could certainly get their though.</p>

      <label for="lbw1p4g" class="commentText"><p>The play-making and creation off the dribble aren&rsquo;t there yet for me to be confident in him being my full-time starting PG. I think he&rsquo;s one of the best starting SG&rsquo;s you can ask for that isn&rsquo;t a star. He&rsquo;s going into just his 4th year though and has already shown significant improvements on the offensive side of the ball, so I can see the Magic having him be their PG to try to develop those skills, but not necessarily because he currently possesses those skills at a level you&rsquo;d want.</p>

      <label for="lbw4f9f" class="commentText"><p>Watching the Magic play this year I was really impressed with Suggs. He is exactly what I think Josh Green could be if he played with confidence and consistency. Green never had though.</p>

<p>The one place I think the Magic could upgrade is Cole Anthony. I just don&rsquo;t think he has great decision making a a point guard</p>

      <label for="lbw2d6z" class="commentText"><p>Was really down on Suggs after his rookie year tbh. His jump in 3pt shooting is the kind of thing you try to convince yourself will actually happen with a young player shooting as poorly as he did as a rookie lol. Don’t think he’ll become a legit point guard but hopefully learning how to change speed/slow down and see more of the court comes next. He still commits a lot of unforced turnovers by only going 100mph with the ball in his hands lol.</p>

<p>But man, he’s going to be good for a long time. What a luxury to have him as our third guy.</p>

      <label for="lbwcuzw" class="commentText"><p>Thank you OP, I honestly was just in a debate with someone about how Suggs is clearly better than Anfernee.</p>

<p>Many still believe Suggs is some terrible offensive player and is only playable because of his defense and its honestly crazy. Jalen is a legit 3rd option on a top playoff team. He is playing the same role Philly Jimmy did, or KP (from Boston), or Andrew Wiggins from recent championship Warriors, he is guarding the other teams best player most of the minutes while also being a top scoring threat. Suggs isnt the same as before.</p>

<p>I absolutely take him over Anfernee going back to the recent debate. Suggs is an all-world defender, who would have been all nba first team if the rules didnt change this season, and is a guy that can pretty easily drop 15+ and sometimes pop off and drop 20+. He needs consistency and throughout the season we saw his usage get higher and higher as honestly the Magic had no other options and Suggs was filling the role as a top reliable scorer. Gary Harris was a negative offensive option, so Suggs stepped up and did it extremely well despite also having to run around and put pressure on the entire opposing team the entire game. It must be extremely hard to play that elite defense and still be the main playmaker (his playmaking stats are actually very high just maybe not raw stats), 3rd option scorer, who needs to also play offball and keep the opposing team on their toes, and be the best fastbreak threat on our team. Suggs filled alot of shoes because of necessity and he did it more than well enough.</p>

<p>I keep telling anybody that will listen but Suggs could be an All Star very soon, the guy is a top 10 athlete in the NBA, it goes under the radar because he isnt always offensively minded but his strength, speed, burst, flexibility, and honestly most importantly stamina and durability are all elite. The guy plays hard every minute on the court, while taking punishment for his risky playstyle.  Suggs isnt the same as he was his first 2 years, he added something to his game every offseason, and this season he fully blossomed a unique playstyle that I cant see any other player emulate. Its a playstyle that fits Jalens motor, its a playstyle that fits his intensity, its a playstyle that allows him to push his limits and grow.  If Jalen Suggs gets the max, I think its absolutely worth it. I truly see him as a top guard in this league not that far away, he is a growing 3 level offensive and defensive threat , with all world defense, deep range, insane athleticism, leadership, and gamechanging momentum shifting intensity. If he continues his developmental trend, I can see Suggs being the most talked about player on our team and I am serious.</p>
