      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1db4jwb/in_game_1_boston_held_dallas_to_the_lowest_true/"><p>In Game 1, Boston held Dallas to the lowest True AST% for any team in a game this postseason (28.1%).</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>By assigning Tatum to Dallas&rsquo; screen-and-roll big men and turning those actions into switches, Dallas was mostly unable to use their pet action to generate catch-and-shoot looks.</p>

<p>I define <strong>True AST%</strong> as the potentially assisted proportion of a team&rsquo;s <strong>True Shot Attempts</strong> (FGA+0.44*FTA; Used in formula for TS%). This lets you get a better idea at what percentage of a team&rsquo;s shot attempts would have been assisted so that the numbers aren&rsquo;t reliant on shots going in to tell the full story of a team&rsquo;s offensive process. <strong>Formula:  TrueAST% = (PotentialAST + FtAST) / TSA</strong></p>

So we still don&rsquo;t know if Boston is going to smother Dallas all series. I think that&rsquo;s something that people tend to extrapolate a bit too much. Establishing a trend is important and it&rsquo;s just not possible with a single data point.</p>

      <label for="l7p3w1q" class="commentText"><p>What makes me believe that Boston&rsquo;s defense is going to stick for the remainder of the series is that they has been playing this way all year and Dallas certainly had to know it was coming, yet they didn&rsquo;t seem like they had any answers just yet. I will acknowledge that it&rsquo;s hard to figure out that defense without seeing it firsthand, but Dallas had to know they were going to get this look from Boston going in.</p>

<p>I am sure they will figure out some wrinkles, but the core idea of &ldquo;make their worst shooter beat us with above the break 3s&rdquo; will likely remain.</p>

<p>Luka and Kyrie will really have to perform and find ways to get production from their role-players.</p>

<p>Boston is just a bad matchup on both sides of the court. When Horford is in they can comfortably switch everything which Minny couldn&rsquo;t. When KP is in they can still switch 1-4 and shut down the lob threat by having Tatum on Lively. Only OKC really had this ability (held mavs to a 111 ORTG) but they had spacing issues with Giddey and J-Dub was not good in his first playoffs so they couldn&rsquo;t score until game 6 and by then it was too late.</p>

<p>Thought this is an underated thing going into this series. Especially with the Mavs relying so heavily on players without playoff experience, including relying so much on a rookie (Lively) who didn&rsquo;t receive the same scrutiny and counterplanning that Chet did.</p>

      <label for="l7otbb8" class="commentText"><p>Chet was clearly viewed differently by the league, though. You had LeBron on his podcast breaking down how tough he was to guard in detail, and bringing up that the Lakers had developed countermeasures <em>specifically for dealing with him in the postseason</em> before the regular season even ended. No one was focused on Lively like that&ndash;he wasn&rsquo;t even the starter, and people didn&rsquo;t consider the Mavs a serious postseason threat at the time. Lively also had huge improvements to end the season while Chet was basically amazing from the getgo and then gradually slowed down as the wear and tear of the season built up and teams started to figure out counters.</p>

      <label for="l7rzgzh" class="commentText"><p>This is exactly why they killed the Wolves - their scheme matches well to always help off of Gobert who has no offense. You can tell the Wolves tried to draw up something for him but he just couldn’t create</p>

      <label for="l7qkbs8" class="commentText"><p>Are they? Based on what? They&rsquo;ve been locked in this playoffs. The game 2s against Miami and Cleveland were the hear Heat and Cavs playing out of their minds and the C&rsquo;s shooting catching the bad side of variance, not dumb play. The Celtics may still lose games this series but it&rsquo;ll be because the Mavs performed, not because the Celtics didn&rsquo;t</p>
