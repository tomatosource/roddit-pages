      <label for="lsn4cc8" class="commentText"><p>JHS and Maxwell Lewis is what happens when you completely ignore analytics and draft using only the eye test (a faulty eye test) and nothing else. </p>

<p>Analytics had both of them like 25 spots lower than where they were drafted. A quick check on any basic analytics website would have filtered them out of any draft board. Both players had a terrible, historically low BPM of under 2 in their last college season. There’s no player in the history of the NBA draft who outperformed their draft day slot and became an average player with a BPM of under 1 on their last college season except maybe GG Jackson one day and at least so far (but he had very special circumstances with his situation and was the youngest player). </p>

<p>Looks like they learned their lesson with Knecht. </p>

<p>EDIT: Just in case you were curious, here’s the list of recent players with a college BPM under 1 in their last season: Ziaire Williams, Blake Wesley, Archie Goodwin, Stephon Zimmerman, Max Christie, Bryce McGowens, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Nick Smith Jr, Emoni Bates, GG Jackson, and Bronny James.</p>

<p>Some of these players were first round picks too so it isn’t even like they are a throwaway late pick and got plenty of development. None are expected to be average except GG Jackson at this point. </p>

<p>If you expand this to BPM under 2 without either a OBPM or DBPM over 2, then you get an even bigger list of similar names which includes Maxwell Lewis and many others. You do have some more potential players like Peyton Watson with BPM between 1 and 2 (but Watson had a nearly 4 DBPM and a negative OBPM, so he doesn’t fit the full filter). </p>

<p>Anyways you can always confirm yourself. Just look up any player for their college stats and you will see pretty much every average player in the NBA had a BPM of over 2 in their last college season (the closest you’ll get is Zach Lavine but he had 2.9). BPM isn’t a good stat actually but the BPM low threshold filter is for quick analytical checks to remove people from the pool. </p>

<p>Here’s the crazy part, the Lakers love drafting these players. Along with these 2 and Bronny James, Max Christie is also on this list (and he’s one of the best outcomes). </p>

      <label for="lsn51wy" class="commentText"><p>Caruso and Reaves were undrafted and actually had really good advanced stats. Kuzma also had solid advanced stats.</p>

<p>Those guys would have been valued using analytics. I’m talking about guys only picked on the eye test. Those 3 would have been picked with a combination of eye test and analytics, which also is Knecht. The other 2 were picked only on the eye test, not a combination.</p>

<p>More and more teams are using the basic analytics filter though before going to the eye test next. It was quite clear because Collier fell to the late first and Justin Edwards went undrafted, and those 2 would have completely failed any analytics filter. </p>

<p>EDIT: Also to be clear, I’m not saying only use analytics so hopefully that didn’t come off that way. I’m saying you at least need an analytics filter first before going to the eye test. A combination is always the best. Using both is optimal and JHS is someone who actually would have failed all analytics filters so unless they were extraordinary outlier level high on the eye test, I don’t quite see why he was picked.</p>

      <label for="lsn6mgr" class="commentText"><p>I’m just saying the eye test shouldn’t even matter for players who fail a super low threshold analytics filter. It doesn’t matter who’s eyes it is, unless they have some special circumstance, don’t even bother watching them. </p>

<p>As I said, no player in the history of the NBA draft has ever become an average NBA player with a final season college BPM of under 2. JHS and Maxwell Lewis both had that, as did lottery picks like Ziaire Williams who clearly are busts. So why even bother with an eye test of them unless you think they are some outlier exception to history. </p>

<p>GG Jackson might actually finally break this streak but GG actually had very special circumstances those 2 don’t have being one of the youngest drafted players ever in the one and done era as a reclass up prospect. </p>

<p>Also want to add its almost impossible to fail this analytics filter. Players like Jaylen Brown who were super raw and had shaky analytics and a perfect example of eye test over analytics still had a BPM of 3.6 so not even close to the 2 threshold. JHS had a BPM of 0.7. Very few players fail this per year and the Lakers drafted 2 who did (the others were Emoni Bates and Nick Smith Jr from that draft year, plus GG)</p>

      <label for="lsnddu2" class="commentText"><p>No.</p>

<p>Because for a winning team who actually has the pieces to do it, fans won&rsquo;t be satisfied with nepo hires alone, even if it&rsquo;s from one of the gods of the game. And sure as fuck fans won&rsquo;t ever tolerate the offspring of said god being shit at the game, because to them, it reflects poorly on the father and the organization as a whole.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t me agreeing with fan takes (fuck &lsquo;em), but me trying to distill what makes Bronny so easy and consistent to hate. All the expectations compound so that nothing satisfies. He could win a ring this year by whipping Wemby-Paul Spurs and crushing the Celtics at their best and people will NEVER EVER give Bronny props for it even if video evidence proves he played as good as his dad.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just the inherent price for being the son of a great performing at the biggest stage: he&rsquo;s a commodity now, and the audience have deemed his value too low to count.</p>

<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s barely begun. LeBron isn&rsquo;t making this easier for his son, it&rsquo;s clear from the get-go. If social media existed in the &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s, Ken Griffey Jr. will never have become a Hall of Famer.</p>

<p>A late 2nd round pick, almost never sees playtime outside of preseason and spends most of their time in the development league. 2nd round picks are disposable, have the lowest pay, which makes it comparable of a paid internship job.</p>

      <label for="lsn8667" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s probably a combination of people&rsquo;s moral crusade against nepotism and LeBron haters putting Bronny in the crosshairs as well.</p>

<p>Year and year again they wait for him LeBron to get washed but he just showed out in the Olympics.</p>

<p>At least with Bronny he&rsquo;ll be pretty bad in most games and they can make the excuse that it&rsquo;s actually the nepotism they hate instead. Forget about all the past cases of nepotism in the league which never had this much of a spotlight though.</p>

<p>Oh, and when they get called out for hating a fucking teenager they&rsquo;ll just say it&rsquo;s LeBron&rsquo;s fault for forcing him into this position.</p>

Tough to decide who i was more wrong about between him, McLemore, and Josh Jackson. I really decided to overlook his poor college season and believe he was the next Paul George</p>
