      <p>Not sure what happened this off-season but I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of Rockets fans saying he shouldn&rsquo;t get the max and that the FO should corner him into a sub-max deal.</p>

      <label for="lsydbq9" class="commentText"><p>Why can&rsquo;t Sengun be both praise-worthy and not worth a max contract? Also there are a lot of rocket fans, its not that unusual for a fan base to be split on various topics. Just because some people are saying he shouldn&rsquo;t get the max doesn&rsquo;t mean its the exact same people that were praising him all season long.</p>

      <label for="lsyf4bc" class="commentText"><p>Well there’s a very obvious answer to why that can’t be the case, it’s called Sengun’s agent and contract demands. The Rockets will have to pay him a max or very close to it to keep him, and so effectively the conversation is, do we pay the max to him or watch him walk.</p>

<p>It’s a completely reasonable discussion to have because the decision tree is basically binary in this case. There is a zero percent chance he accepts a mid level deal, he’s going to want $40m+ per year</p>

<p>A. Better rim protection</p>

<p> B.An outside shot and better Free throw shooting    </p>

<p> He’s an amazing ball handler, scorer, passer but imo I wouldn’t max him if he doesn’t get an outside shot but I’m optimistic on his shot or else he’s pretty hard to build around.  Kind of reminds me of kings demarcous cousins for some reason. That’s just my opinion though</p>

<p>The fact is that you have to do more than score and pass the ball to succeed as a slow big in the modern NBA, and the new CBA makes it much more damaging to teams who want to pay big money to centers who can&rsquo;t contribute max-level value</p>

It literally infuriates me how people compare this guy to Jokic when they were similar ages. This man Jokic literally can shoot from anywhere on the court very efficiently. His playmaking is tiers above Sengun plus he&rsquo;s 7 foot and not an undersized center that will get bullied. Sengun is so overrated lmao.</p>

      <label for="lsyeyu8" class="commentText"><p>Teams don&rsquo;t use restricted free agency to their advantage when it is literally the reason it exists. Sengun is a good player, but why offer him the max if you dont need to? Especially when next season only 2 or 3 teams would actually be able to offer it to him. Teams are more worried about hurting a dudes feelings when this is what leaves you with albatross contracts that dismantle your ability to team build. If someone offers him a max, match it&hellip; or not, im still not completely sold on Sengun.</p>

<p>Houston is in an interesting spot, and if I had to put money on it, I would bet against Sungun being the best player on the team the next time the rockets win a playoff series.</p>

<p>Teams are more worried about hurting a dudes feelings when this is what leaves you with albatross contracts that dismantle your ability to team build. If someone offers him a max, match it&hellip; or not, im still not completely sold on Sengun.</p>

<p>This notoriously worked well with Deandre Ayton, and it also opens the door for the team to get screwed over later</p>

<li><p>He may actually be worth the (rookie extension) max, but is probably not a guy that you need to make that decision now - but rather can just wait a year and either you then pay it if that&rsquo;s what the RFA market dictates, or you will get to sign him for less.</p></li>

<li><p>Although he can be a great floor raiser in the regular season, there are questions over what his role can be on a playoff team. That is why he fell so far in the draft IMO - everyone knew his talent in the post. It&rsquo;s gonna be about whether he can play good enough defence to be your 5, or whether can provide spacing to be a 4 alongside a true 5? If you don&rsquo;t have an answer to those questions &lsquo;do you really want him taking a max contract for the next 4-5 years when you are trying to build a contender?</p></li>

<li><p>Houston has so many good young players/prospects, that they still need to see what works. I personally think there is is still a decent chance that with the defensive versatility of both Jabari and Eason, particularly as they get older and stronger, they might be able to defend big enough to cover for Sengun as your 5. OR they might not and you are stuck at my last question. Or you might have 1 or 2 of the guards/wings really take a leap and you suddenly decide that going forward your offence is better being run through Amen (or Green), in which case you probably don&rsquo;t want Sengun near the lane.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But you don&rsquo;t need to answer any of these questions right now. You have another year to wait, and then you can just match any RFA offers that are put in front of him (which I am sure Houston will do) and just pay whatever the market rate is. But this way you aren&rsquo;t committing to that money a year early, and will have a better idea of what your future rotation might look like. (And maybe you float Sengun as a S&amp;T option as well if the packages are good enough).</p>

<p>(And all this also applies to Jalen Green, but just probably a tier down right now).</p>

      <label for="lsyhkng" class="commentText"><p>The new CBA makes it too punishing if one of your max players can&rsquo;t get you to the top of the mountain. He&rsquo;s really good but I don&rsquo;t see his defense improving to be impactful, nor do I think he has the shooting touch needed to be the centerpiece like Jokic is. I&rsquo;d be more comfortable with those if he was two inches taller.</p>

<p>I think other members of the team are going to pan out better and be more valuable.</p>

      <label for="lsyf17a" class="commentText"><p>I am aware of their record last year after he went out and also aware Green played better without him.  I still think it is WAY smarter to build around Sengun than Green &ndash; I don&rsquo;t really care that Green played better without him, if Green can&rsquo;t figure out how to play with him then you move on from Green and focus on Sengun. I simply think that Sengun has shown enough thus far  in his career to be worthy of a rookie max extension, which aren&rsquo;t even super crazy deals. He is worth that.  If anything you are the one box score watching by just listing the stats frmo when he was out, that ignores the on court impact he has shown he has been capable of for a couple years now.  He is really good, the fact that a terrible team that is not constucted with the idea of him as a centerpiece played a little better for a month or two after he went down doesnt really move the needle much for me in my judgment of him as a player.  He is worthy of that contract imo</p>
