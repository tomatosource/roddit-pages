Also there are a lot of rocket fans, its not that unusual for a fan base to be split on various topics. Just because some people are saying he shouldn&rsquo;t get the max doesn&rsquo;t mean its the exact same people that were praising him all season long.</p>

      <label for="lsyf4bc" class="commentText"><p>Well there’s a very obvious answer to why that can’t be the case, it’s called Sengun’s agent and contract demands. The Rockets will have to pay him a max or very close to it to keep him, and so effectively the conversation is, do we pay the max to him or watch him walk.</p>

<p>It’s a completely reasonable discussion to have because the decision tree is basically binary in this case. There is a zero percent chance he accepts a mid level deal, he’s going to want $40m+ per year</p>

      <label for="lsyksyz" class="commentText"><p>So wait to pay him, and offer him the max after this season. He literally has no leverage, he&rsquo;s not the level of player to where you should worry about upsetting him.</p>

<p>The rockets are in a very interesting situation and they need to be absolutely SURE that this is the route they want to go. contracts like these (and potentially green&rsquo;s) can destroy your ability to build, especially with the new CBA. There is literally no rush to pay him when he&rsquo;s an RFA</p>

      <label for="lsynont" class="commentText"><p>I agree, which is why I was shocked the Magic decided to max extend Franz Wagner a year before RFA. Like those guys aren’t at the level where you care about upsetting them and would rather wait for more info because there’s a real chance Wagner doesn’t improve as much as you want for a max player (Sixers even waited for Maxey and Maxey is just fine). The Magic should only max extend one player and that’s Banchero because he’s too good and you don’t need a fourth year anyways to know how good he is. Everyone else should wait until RFA. Rockets should wait until RFA too, and Sengun will still get his max anyways so it’s all good. </p>

<p>A. Better rim protection</p>

<p> B.An outside shot and better Free throw shooting    </p>

<p> He’s an amazing ball handler, scorer, passer but imo I wouldn’t max him if he doesn’t get an outside shot but I’m optimistic on his shot or else he’s pretty hard to build around.  Kind of reminds me of kings demarcous cousins for some reason. That’s just my opinion though</p>

      <label for="lsyk5w8" class="commentText"><p>Sabonis is very high up there in terms of most attempted field goals while being closely guarded by a defender, and it&rsquo;s not like he was bricking them either. I think this just shows that he&rsquo;s a very aggressive scorer, but averages 2 points fewer than Sengun probably because of scheme and role.</p>

<p>Sabonis has 252 total FGAs while closely guarded, and he hit them at 56.7%.</p>

<p>Sengun has 189 total FGAs, and he hit them at 47.6%.</p>

<p>For context, Giannis is at 237 FGAs and 65.4%, Jokic is at 228 and 57.5%, AD is at 228 and 55.3%, and Zion is at 289 and 53.6%.</p>

<p>To be clear here, the purpose of this stat is to just see who&rsquo;s taking shots while being smothered by their defender. In my opinion, that&rsquo;s a sign of scoring aggressiveness.</p>

      <label for="lt07147" class="commentText"><p>Sengun played 63 total games vs Sabonis&rsquo; 82 which just completely invalidates your number. If we look extrapolate Sengun&rsquo;s number out to 82 games, then Sengun is actually right with Sabonis at 246. You can&rsquo;t just compare counting stats when one guy played 19 more games than the other&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>If we want to look at &ldquo;scoring aggressiveness&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s just a bad stat to look at. That just shows me if someone is either taking bad shots, or can&rsquo;t create separation on their shots. There are a bunch of better stats to look at for scoring aggressiveness.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sengun has nearly 3 more FGA per game compared to Sabonis</li>
<li>Sengun has 2.2 isolation per game to Sabonis&rsquo; 0.6</li>
<li>Sengun has 3.6 post ups per game to Sabonis&rsquo; 2.6</li>
<li>Sabonis has 91.5 touches per game to Sengun&rsquo;s 61.5</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, that&rsquo;s just showing that Sengun is being asked to take more shots, and in possession types that are historically more difficult to do as a 1-on-1 scorer, while still touching the ball less times per game. IMO, that shows that Sengun is being more aggressive as a 1-on-1 scorer than Sabonis.</p>

      <label for="lt0dhqy" class="commentText"><p>I used total FGAs just to show people the sample sizes that we&rsquo;re working with here. You can go on NBA.com and click &ldquo;per game&rdquo; instead and all the top centers basically average 3 highly-contested 2&rsquo;s per game, including Sabonis, Jokic, and Sengun.</p>

<p>You can also play with the distances on that stat, which will then tell you if the players are taking bad shots, or if they&rsquo;re pounding their defenders and taking the shots they can.</p>

<p>With defenders 2-4 feet away, Sabonis averages 6.3 FGAs per game at 61.8%, while Sengun averages 7.3 FGAs at 59.1%.</p>

<p>With defenders 4-6 feet away, which is pretty rare for a big man, Sabonis averages 1.9 FGAs at 69.7%, while Sengun averages 2.6 FGAs at 59.3%.</p>

<p>The touch per game metric is a bad metric to use in this case, since all it should tell you is that Sabonis plays a different role in the offense than Sengun does, as most of his touches are setting up passes. This was something that people in this comment chain already appear to be aware of, so I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to mention it until now.</p>

<p>What all these numbers should tell us is that Sabonis averages about as many points as Sengun on better efficiencies despite defenders staying attached to them. It&rsquo;s not like their teams are scrubs either, so the fact that Sabonis is attempting those shots and making them, says to me that he is very aggressive and efficient with the ball, much more so than most centers in this league.</p>

      <label for="lsyib89" class="commentText"><p>sabonis focuses on setting his teammates up more than sengun which is why he isn&rsquo;t aggressive scoring wise. he&rsquo;s much more efficient than sengun is also. i think if he wanted to he could score more which would also tank his efficiency</p>

<p>Domantas (2021-22 to present)</p>

<p>10FT-3PT range - 1.22 attempts per game (9.79% of total FGA) .430 shooting percentage in this range.</p>

<p>Alperen Sengun (2021-22 to present)</p>

      <label for="lsywuee" class="commentText"><p>Interesting stat for sure, but just look at Sabonis&rsquo; time on the kings, since I only started watching him then and it&rsquo;s how he currently plays. He averaged 1.1 3PT attempts a game all 3 seasons and he&rsquo;s literally left open there all game long. When he shoots his one attempt a game, you can see he&rsquo;s hesitant and there&rsquo;s no confidence in it. Amazing playmaker, just limited offensive bag.</p>

<p>Now, only compare with Sengun&rsquo;s last season, since it&rsquo;s the first one with major starter minutes and FGAs. He already has a higher PPG than Sabonis has ever had, on 1.8 3PT attempts, and while playing 3 less minutes per game. His per 36 minutes is an even 2.0 3PT attempts a game, so double Sabonis.</p>

<p>Really, it&rsquo;s just the quality of shots and the confidence behind them. Just look at Sengun highlights vs. Sabonis and you&rsquo;ll see he&rsquo;s a more willing shooter from range than Sabonis with a much deeper bag. In just his third season, I see a lot more potential there for further offensive development and shooting %.</p>

<p>The fact is that you have to do more than score and pass the ball to succeed as a slow big in the modern NBA, and the new CBA makes it much more damaging to teams who want to pay big money to centers who can&rsquo;t contribute max-level value</p>

<p>With the new CBA, we aren&rsquo;t going to be able to keep everyone, but any slight overpay means another young guy probably needs to be shipped out. The Rockets in general just need to be a lot more stringent with their extensions than other teams.</p>

      <label for="lt06odr" class="commentText"><p>Yep. Exactly this. It&rsquo;s why Dynasties will be harder to put together and kept long term. The minute a rotation player tastes the limelight, that player becomes unsignable. Aaron Gordon is a wonderful super roleplayer. 150 million, is a lot of money for a 3rd/4th option if you want a real bench and a complete starting 5. That&rsquo;s around 40 mil a year when you already paid Jokic (worth every penny) and Jamal (yikes) and porter Jr making more every year (also close to 40). The Rockets are a season away from finding out who their future stars are and who aren&rsquo;t. Paying Sengun is not an easy decision.</p>

<p>Pretty much all the responses are saying Sengun will get one or deserves to get one (but just next year in RFA rather than now) and Green doesn’t. The one person saying Sengun doesn’t deserve it got downvoted. Seems like the Rockets fans love Sengun and think he’s deserving. </p>

<p>I think the consensus opinion is don’t give him a max extension now, wait a year for RFA, match all offers in RFA, which will end up being a max for Sengun anyways. Green probably won’t get one. </p>

      </div>
      <label for="lt07p4u" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. There are two big Houston specific factors at play for why Sengun hasn&rsquo;t got an extension:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sengun has a low cap hold next summer, and it the Rockets decline FVV&rsquo;s player option, they can open up a max cap space slot and extend Sengun after FA (like Philly did with Maxey).</li>
<li>The Rockets have 5 other young guys after Sengun and Green they need to worry about extending. The Rockets needs to be more stringent than other teams because if they give out max contracts too easily, they&rsquo;re going to run out of cap space real quick.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I also think the Rockets are just being more cautious building their team with the new CBA rules. Having a bad max contract on your team hurts more than ever, so everyone probably needs to worry more about handing them out than prior years. I think Houston is just taking a more cautious approach with this new CBA.</p>

<p>The bulk of the fanbase thinks he deserves a max but that they favor Philly/Maxey strategy of saving your cap space by not doing a max before you need to, which is next summer</p>

      <label for="lsynat5" class="commentText"><p>There are also cap hold implications as well. Sengun&rsquo;s cap hold goes up from <span class="math inline">\(16M to about \)</span>36M for the 2025 off season if he signs an extension.</p>

<p>So it is to the Rockets advantage to have that extra $20M to spend in FA before signing Sengun in RFA.</p>

<p>Sengun makes the same amount of money in the end, but the Rockets could squeeze out another max cap space by not picking up FVV&rsquo;s option and not extending Green and Sengun until after the FA is signed.</p>

      <label for="lsyeyu8" class="commentText"><p>Teams don&rsquo;t use restricted free agency to their advantage when it is literally the reason it exists. Sengun is a good player, but why offer him the max if you dont need to? Especially when next season only 2 or 3 teams would actually be able to offer it to him. Teams are more worried about hurting a dudes feelings when this is what leaves you with albatross contracts that dismantle your ability to team build. If someone offers him a max, match it&hellip; or not, im still not completely sold on Sengun.</p>

<p>Houston is in an interesting spot, and if I had to put money on it, I would bet against Sungun being the best player on the team the next time the rockets win a playoff series.</p>

<p>This notoriously worked well with Deandre Ayton, and it also opens the door for the team to get screwed over later</p>

<p>But the point is that letting a borderline star go to RFA only results in 1 less year of control (4 years versus 5) with potentially less (as in the Gordon Hayward case already mentioned by someone else), and pisses your player off while guaranteeing his paycheck. All for potentially saving 3-4 million a year when you’re going to be over the cap anyways</p>

      <label for="lsyrsoh" class="commentText"><p>I misremembered the John Collins thing thats my bad.</p>

<p>I genuinely just believe that Sengun is a player whose contract would be best settled at the end of this upcoming season, especially with having to essentially choose between Green and Sengun (sengun is definitely the right choice currently).</p>

<p>Also the Ayton thing seems a little different since the suns actually had a team to match in the Pacers. Realistically the only teams that will be able to offer Sengun the max are the Nets or Wizards, two teams that would be unlikely to do so IMO (and once again you could just match if they do). If Sengun balls out he will get the max from the rockets regardless, but say he either stagnates or regresses, the Rockets will have more leverage. 3-4 million can become valuable with this new CBA, since low-middle end players are getting screwed and having to sign for much less than they are worth. 3-4 million could end up being the price of an important 7th man to help your playoff run. If the rockets can move salary around that small amount of money can be useful.</p>

<p>Sengun being mad shouldn&rsquo;t be a worry for them, because if he does end up being great, the Rockets will be able to offer him significantly more for his next contract.</p>

Gordon Hayward ended up taking a sub max offer sheet with a 4th year player option, opted out, and left for nothing.</p>

2- Sengun was a near All Star last year. If Houston had that easy schedule after his injury before the All Star break they would be in Play-in picture therefore he would be an All Star.<br>
3- In what world a franchise with a horrible team who just started their rebuild, if given chance, would pass on a guy like this? There is just no way.</p>

<p>You are going with the assumption that Sengun is not gonna develop. He showed time and time again that he can develop his game every single year significantly. And lastly, He got a good touch he will improve his shooting and ft%. In fact last year he was pretty nice with his midrange. He also shot 81% ft in Turkey so As his coach Udoka stated it&rsquo;s a confidence thing with him and there are signs of him being a good enough shooter.</p>

<li><p>He may actually be worth the (rookie extension) max, but is probably not a guy that you need to make that decision now - but rather can just wait a year and either you then pay it if that&rsquo;s what the RFA market dictates, or you will get to sign him for less.</p></li>

<li><p>Although he can be a great floor raiser in the regular season, there are questions over what his role can be on a playoff team. That is why he fell so far in the draft IMO - everyone knew his talent in the post. It&rsquo;s gonna be about whether he can play good enough defence to be your 5, or whether can provide spacing to be a 4 alongside a true 5? If you don&rsquo;t have an answer to those questions &lsquo;do you really want him taking a max contract for the next 4-5 years when you are trying to build a contender?</p></li>

<li><p>Houston has so many good young players/prospects, that they still need to see what works. I personally think there is is still a decent chance that with the defensive versatility of both Jabari and Eason, particularly as they get older and stronger, they might be able to defend big enough to cover for Sengun as your 5. OR they might not and you are stuck at my last question. Or you might have 1 or 2 of the guards/wings really take a leap and you suddenly decide that going forward your offence is better being run through Amen (or Green), in which case you probably don&rsquo;t want Sengun near the lane.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But you don&rsquo;t need to answer any of these questions right now. You have another year to wait, and then you can just match any RFA offers that are put in front of him (which I am sure Houston will do) and just pay whatever the market rate is. But this way you aren&rsquo;t committing to that money a year early, and will have a better idea of what your future rotation might look like. (And maybe you float Sengun as a S&amp;T option as well if the packages are good enough).</p>

<p>(And all this also applies to Jalen Green, but just probably a tier down right now).</p>

      <label for="lsyf17a" class="commentText"><p>I am aware of their record last year after he went out and also aware Green played better without him.  I still think it is WAY smarter to build around Sengun than Green &ndash; I don&rsquo;t really care that Green played better without him, if Green can&rsquo;t figure out how to play with him then you move on from Green and focus on Sengun. I simply think that Sengun has shown enough thus far  in his career to be worthy of a rookie max extension, which aren&rsquo;t even super crazy deals. He is worth that.  If anything you are the one box score watching by just listing the stats frmo when he was out, that ignores the on court impact he has shown he has been capable of for a couple years now.  He is really good, the fact that a terrible team that is not constucted with the idea of him as a centerpiece played a little better for a month or two after he went down doesnt really move the needle much for me in my judgment of him as a player.  He is worthy of that contract imo</p>

      <label for="lsymx5w" class="commentText"><p>the problem is that the Rockets are soon going to have to make decisions about their young guys, and first up is Green and Sengun.</p>

<p>There was a period of time last year when Sengun was injured that the team went through Jalen Green instead on offense and they played better.</p>

<p>If they max both of them they&rsquo;re going to have huge problems retaining their talent in the future. Remember, Jabari Smith Jr and Amen Thompson are also high lottery picks.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s likely to happen is that all these guys can&rsquo;t be retained and some hard choices will have to be made. Sengun was seen as a borderline all-star last year, yet the team performed better without him, which might indicate he is at the top of his value as a player and it is time to sell.</p>

<p>Someone is going to give this guy a max. There are franchises in this league that have nothing going on and would gladly build around him. If Houston isn&rsquo;t willing to do that it&rsquo;s time for them to get some assets for him rather than have him leave for nothing.</p>

If he could be had for 10M a year for three more years, that seems like an asset to lock up. He&rsquo;s only 31 and was starting for a very good team just a season and a half ago. I suppose Stone decided you don&rsquo;t pay a guy who was out for more than a year coming off knee surgery. And his expiring contract could be worth something in a trade if he stays healthy. Imagine you&rsquo;re a contending team and you pick up Steven fucking Adams at the trade deadline.</p>

<p>[I feel funny saying this because I&rsquo;ve also been advocating for the Rockets to play small in the non-Sengun minutes, which wouldn&rsquo;t leave many minutes for Adams. Hell, even Landale gets up and down faster than Adams/Sengun. What I&rsquo;d really love to see is Bari/Tari/Uncle Jeff at the 5 running with some of Green, Amen, Shep, Cam, FVV, Brooks and others. I was only able to watch a couple of Houston&rsquo;s preseason games but apparently Ime has other ideas (using Adams as a traditional backup big).]</p>
