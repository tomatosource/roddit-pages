Because everyone here is kinda shitting on him for this but I think it&rsquo;s a reasonable statement. He says he&rsquo;s cool with the new generation and each generation builds on what the generation before them did. He basically just doesn&rsquo;t want to be thought of as a &ldquo;plumber&rdquo; by the new generation which is fair.</p>

Not quite Curry level three, but close enough at his peak without much practice. Imagine Bird shooting more and more threes and putting in serious practice while being huge compared to Curry lol.

Like I said, that Dpoy was coached off his natural physical talents by an amazing coach. It was his only dpoy, he cried and hugged his coach when he got it. Then let’s see, oh the bulls, under Phil and MJ. Yeah can you see the pattern that whenever he was well coached he was actually a net positive instead of a head case that wouldn’t buy in. I think Rodman is fine but acting like he wasn’t a complete party animal asshole to basically everyone is revisionist history</p>

      <label for="llioyu6" class="commentText"><p>What Nique is saying is totally true but he&rsquo;s glossing over the fact that there are plenty of guys from his era who do trash the current generation out of spite/jealousy. It&rsquo;s understandable that they&rsquo;re salty about the reach of social media and how much more they get paid but these guys in their 40s/50s/60s could afford to maybe be a little more mature than Ant Edwards?</p>

<p>I mean, if they said it&rsquo;s easier to score now and they could have averaged 10-20% more that&rsquo;s not unreasonable IMO but it&rsquo;s always like &ldquo;I could have scored 40!&rdquo;. Yeah&hellip; no you couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="llj3qei" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s what always gets me it&rsquo;s the. 1) Apparently ANYONE who was dominate would just score <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub> like it&rsquo;s nothing 2) Also they could basically lock up any player from this generation 3) They don&rsquo;t want it more which is funny players use to smoke/drink before games.</p>

<p>The overwhelming consensus is nothing but hate. I hear Niq but it&rsquo;s just ignoring that the majority of his peers just shit on players of this generation.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think the old heads understand just how much advanced analytics go into the game now and taking away strengths. It&rsquo;s alot harder imo to score in the PLAYOFFS now when teams fully lock in on your beat attributes.</p>

      <label for="llimong" class="commentText"><p>MJ has a quote in his book (and a few interviews around the same time), where he talks about being “the best”. It was in reference to bringing the same energy on both ends of the court, day in and day out. “That’s where I feel like I’m the best [in the league right now]. The best ever? I can’t say that - I’d never say that. We all play in different eras; I never played against Jerry West, Bill Russell, Wilt, Doc [in his prime]…” etc. “I love the game, it’s been good to me, and I like to think I’ve been good to it. All things evolve, and the game has to grow. I’m excited to see it continue to do so. Unless they fundamentally change the rules of the game, there will be someone FAR greater than Michael Jordan.”</p>

You don’t think he felt he was the goat, and said so behind closed doors? He knew how to play to his image and that’s part of why he has the greatest legacy via basketball of all time. I do love how he was a two way player though, too much offense and not enough defense by “great” players now a days.</p>

      <label for="llj0jj0" class="commentText"><p>As guys should. No one is saying that guys in the NBA shouldn&rsquo;t have an ego, especially when they are as great as Michael Jordan.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s having an ego and then there&rsquo;s calling yourself the best ever. No one who was ever the best at anything ever referred to themselves as the best. They let their actions speak for them out of respect for the competition.</p>

<p>Crowning yourself is an action that seeks validation from others. Someone who is unquestionably the best doesn&rsquo;t need to seek that validation, they know they already have it.</p>

      <label for="llijtn4" class="commentText"><p>The interesting part to me is (at least from what I see) how this talk about eras isn&rsquo;t part of the discussion for other sports. Like you don&rsquo;t really see NFL fans talking about the quality of competition Jim Brown was going against or something. I follow other sports, but this definitely seems like more of an NBA thing.  *edit: Mainly mean this from the aspect of the quality of players from past eras isn&rsquo;t as discussed in other sports nearly as often</p>

      <label for="llimzh6" class="commentText"><p>Every sport does it, but the NBA is by far the worse. I blame the NBA itself. The league does a terrible job of persevering history and exposing legends to new fans. For example, the NFL has plenty of documentaries on older players, film sessions with former and current players, and that NFL 100 players of all time list. The NBA rolls out the same 6 legends once a year at all star weekend and calls it a day. I also think the NBA cares more about online engagement rather than the product. That plays a factor in how narratives are built.</p>

      <label for="llj2dsk" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a product of how they market the game, which is player-focused, so they&rsquo;re constantly convincing fans that players are elite and special and better than we&rsquo;ve ever seen before.  Just watch any of the commercials and how they market playoff series, etc.  Every young player is marketed like they&rsquo;re the greatest player in franchise history.  This is at direct odds with lifting up past players and showing them reverence/repsect.  The marketing for the NBA and the discourse is generally just way more dramatic for all of these reasons.  They also treat the league like a soap opera more so than any other sports league, and this creates a heightened sense of emotion and drama for everything <em>current</em> versus anything that happened in the <em>past</em>.  It&rsquo;s especially true if you weren&rsquo;t around to experience what happened in the past.</p>

      <label for="llj19pp" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s because the NBA markets itself on the players being the best in the world. It&rsquo;s a strategy they&rsquo;ve used since the 80&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a strategy that has built them into what they are.</p>

<p>But they can&rsquo;t use that kind of marketing without perpetuating recency bias. Very rarely when something happens in the NBA is it actually the best thing ever, the NBA wants to keep hyping it like it is, because fans like to feel like they are a part of something great right now even if they&rsquo;re not.</p>

Mostly on how the rule changes have made passing and offense in general easier. A lot of QB discussion involves this specifically.</p>

<p>Like, I just googled Dan Marino Yardage to look up an example, and first line on the top result is &ldquo;Although Marino played at a time when it wasn&rsquo;t easy to throw the ball&rdquo;</p>

<p>NFL fans have a much better appreciation for the difference in eras.
 People recognize that achievements like Marino passing for 5000 yards in the 80&rsquo;s was way more difficult than a player doing it today.</p>

<p>Whereas NBA fans tend to do the opposite.  &ldquo;Yeah so and so averaged 30 points but he did it against plumbers!&rdquo;, while totally ignoring how much the rule changes of today have elevated offense.</p>

<p>Which is why for me personally all GOAT discussions are centered around how good a player was relative to his competition at the time. If you want to pick the best player, just look at the most recent season&rsquo;s MVP or FMVP.</p>

<p>What matters to me is, was their in-game performance consistently better than their competition? Did they win? Did their peers think they were on the same level? Individual accolades and counting stats obviously factor in, but only as a tiebreaker IMO.</p>

      <label for="lliokzp" class="commentText"><p>because in football money is from sponsors. these guys dont have a pay gap as wide as the nba does between generations. role players make in one year more then stars do their entire career. they will never admit it but if old gen made more money they wouldnt say a word. cant hurt no ones feelings when you swimming in pool of 200mil dollar bills.</p>

      <label for="llipo00" class="commentText"><p>Seeing this question come up a lot.</p>

<p>I think the desire to compare players from different eras is more prevalent in basketball basically because a basketball team only has five players, so if one of them is clearly head and shoulders above everyone else, it really pops out. In baseball or football, there&rsquo;s a much more clear cut way to say who the best defenders are, and it&rsquo;s much less noticable when one single player is making most of the difference because there are just more bodies out there.</p>

<p>This results in it being quite easy to spot who the best players are. In fact it&rsquo;s usually so obvious that people actually get into heated arguments over whether this guy is the number four player on earth or actually the number seven player on earth.</p>

<p>So when you start ranking the players today, the next logical step is to rank them all time. That&rsquo;s just more seemingly possible with basketball players than it is with players in most other team sports.</p>

<p>Fwiw, I&rsquo;ve never really been a fan of comparing eras, mostly because people overdo it on both ends.</p>

<p>Fans of old heads mythologize them and their era, way more than is justified. But fans of the modern game tend to be way too dismissive of older guys. Like I&rsquo;ve seen people say Larry Bird wouldn&rsquo;t make an all star team if he played today, which is just idiotic. But I&rsquo;ve also seen people say Jaylen Brown would dominate like MJ if he played in 1989, which is equally idiotic.</p>

<p>Wilkins&rsquo; thoughts are rational. Look, basketball is meant to be competitive and fun. Not divisive. Anthony Edward&rsquo;s, while talented, his commentary reeks of ignorance.</p>

<p>As Wilkens said in his piece; the game of basketball will continuously evolve over time.</p>

<p>I totally agree with Nique that it&rsquo;s silly to compare across generations in general, but it&rsquo;s extra silly to have that debate when you&rsquo;re still 23 and the most notable thing you&rsquo;ve done is dunk on Yuta Watanabe.</p>

<p>No one is genuinely arguing that Ant wouldn&rsquo;t dominate if you could magically drop him into 80&rsquo;s competition, it&rsquo;s such a narrow-minded argument to make. I&rsquo;d bet anything that in 40 year&rsquo;s the best players would be able to cook whatever prime Ant looks like if you magically dropped them into the 2020&rsquo;s NBA. The game will continue to evolve and improve.</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t misconstrue this as Ant hate, I love him on the court.</p>

Do these nba players realize how much their games would change if they called palming, hand checks and travels. Players nowadays legit are playing with one extra step and numerous others rules which allows them to appear more skilled. What can Anthony Edwards do skill wise or dribble wise that any pg couldn’t do in the 90s. Y’all think Vince Carter can’t dribble like Anthony Edwards? Tmac had even better handles. The hesi carry that Durant does which allows him to get off his shot, yall think tmac couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>The next generation should be allowed to take four steps and let’s see them create moves never imagined and then watch them take a shit on our current players for not being able to do them.</p>

Also, to use your own point against you: the game was completely different back then and it wasn’t centered around the three-point line and there wasn’t as much of a premium on shooting as there was on low post play, etc. It goes both ways. Also, there were guys who could absolutely light it up.</p>

<p>Yes it would have been easier for them to do certain things on the court, especially offensively. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they would just magically know how to pull off the moves that todays stars do, without seeing the guys before them.</p>

<p>Would Giannis be euro-step dunking on people today if Ginobli didn&rsquo;t come first and popularize the euro-step? If you can find a player doing a modern euro-step in the 70&rsquo;s and getting called for a travel because they picked up on their 0-step, I&rsquo;ll take it all back.</p>

I actually get the general sentiment that the guy I replied to was saying but it feels mistargeted. Like if Paul Pierce came out like this i&rsquo;d totally get it but Nique&rsquo; has always seemed to love welcoming in younger players from my experience.</p>

They went out and got run over by other teams, injured left and right, forced to play every game in the season, and made like a tenth of what players today are getting. Let the elders talk, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt much.</p>

<p>I think the old heads are saddened about the lack of love for the game though. The younger generation don’t watch the sport. They treat it like a job. They don’t love it like they do.</p>

      <label for="llino2w" class="commentText"><p>You know, this is true most of wherever you go in life. I&rsquo;m not taking sides here, I&rsquo;m just saying. For example in school or at work, the older guys who have been there for a bit will always sort of talk shit about the younger guys or have them prove themselves first or what not. Hazing, in short. But you will be hard pressed to find young guys who talk shit about the older guys, because they get punished in some sort of way. There is just some level of entitlement that people have when they are ahead of others due to having been there or doing things first. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right or should be accepted, but it&rsquo;s just human behavior, I guess. Magnified 100x due to these people being famous athletes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only logical really. Old heads have nothing better to do(like we do here on Reddit) than to talk about the current players. The current generation don&rsquo;t have time for that shit, they&rsquo;re playing ball.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ironic, All The Smoke podcasts summary on google starts with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALL THE SMOKE pairs two of the most outspoken and controversial players of their time. Known as fiery, intense competitors during their on-court careers, Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson are now two of &hellip;</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t Stephen Jackson one of those people Nique is talking about in reality?</p>
