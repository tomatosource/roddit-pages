He basically just doesn&rsquo;t want to be thought of as a &ldquo;plumber&rdquo; by the new generation which is fair.</p>

<p>Cmon now. People say this about Draymond today too. Draymond wouldn’t be as good if he wasn’t drafted to the Warriors, but he would still be able to play on other teams.</p>

<p>Pistons Rodman would see playing time on any team. He may not be as good as he was in the Pistons, where not only was he a two time DPOY but he even led the league in FG percentage somehow one year, but he would play. </p>

<p>Your own Cavs were playing like Mike Sanders and Hot Rod Williams big mins and you think Rodman would get completely benched?</p>

Not quite Curry level three, but close enough at his peak without much practice. Imagine Bird shooting more and more threes and putting in serious practice while being huge compared to Curry lol.

      <label for="llioyu6" class="commentText"><p>What Nique is saying is totally true but he&rsquo;s glossing over the fact that there are plenty of guys from his era who do trash the current generation out of spite/jealousy. It&rsquo;s understandable that they&rsquo;re salty about the reach of social media and how much more they get paid but these guys in their 40s/50s/60s could afford to maybe be a little more mature than Ant Edwards?</p>

<p>I mean, if they said it&rsquo;s easier to score now and they could have averaged 10-20% more that&rsquo;s not unreasonable IMO but it&rsquo;s always like &ldquo;I could have scored 40!&rdquo;. Yeah&hellip; no you couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The overwhelming consensus is nothing but hate. I hear Niq but it&rsquo;s just ignoring that the majority of his peers just shit on players of this generation.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think the old heads understand just how much advanced analytics go into the game now and taking away strengths. It&rsquo;s alot harder imo to score in the PLAYOFFS now when teams fully lock in on your beat attributes.</p>

It was in reference to bringing the same energy on both ends of the court, day in and day out. “That’s where I feel like I’m the best [in the league right now]. The best ever? I can’t say that - I’d never say that. We all play in different eras; I never played against Jerry West, Bill Russell, Wilt, Doc [in his prime]…” etc. “I love the game, it’s been good to me, and I like to think I’ve been good to it. All things evolve, and the game has to grow. I’m excited to see it continue to do so. Unless they fundamentally change the rules of the game, there will be someone FAR greater than Michael Jordan.”</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, Bolt, Ali, Simone biles, pelé, Ronaldo, Hamilton, etc. You might call it seeking validation, they might call it just speaking facts, opinions and all that. MJ literally called himself Jesus, has the greatest player ever inscribed on air Jordans, and turned a doc about his team into his own personal ode, but I guess as long as never came on ESPN and said ’m the greatest player ever lol.</p>

I follow other sports, but this definitely seems like more of an NBA thing.  *edit: Mainly mean this from the aspect of the quality of players from past eras isn&rsquo;t as discussed in other sports nearly as often</p>

      <label for="llimzh6" class="commentText"><p>Every sport does it, but the NBA is by far the worse. I blame the NBA itself. The league does a terrible job of persevering history and exposing legends to new fans. For example, the NFL has plenty of documentaries on older players, film sessions with former and current players, and that NFL 100 players of all time list. The NBA rolls out the same 6 legends once a year at all star weekend and calls it a day. I also think the NBA cares more about online engagement rather than the product. That plays a factor in how narratives are built.</p>

      <label for="lljgp9l" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d also say that while it&rsquo;s always been about stars to one degree or another, the NBA has less emphasis on team support and fans of teams. Yes, of course, there are diehards in every city, but a lot of younger fans don&rsquo;t care about teams, they care about players.</p>

<p>The NBA &ldquo;player empowerment&rdquo; movement has lead to players changing teams far more often due to shorter contracts and more blockbuster style trades. This leads to fans seeing maybe their favourite player traded to another team more often than other sports.</p>

<p>You think all Lebron fans are holding it down for Cleveland or Miami? Or are they now &ldquo;Laker fans&rdquo;? If Steph somehow got traded, tons of Warriors fans would switch allegiance.</p>

<p>Then you look at the NHL. A top 10 player, Leon Draisaitl just signed an <em>EIGHT</em> year contract with the Oilers. That could be four different contracts for one NBA player.</p>

<p>Player movement has the downside of drawing fans to the team the player is on and not caring so much about the team. When you go from a Lebron championship in Cleveland in 2016, and that team basically tanks for 5 or 6 years before finally being a playoff contender again, lots of newer fans don&rsquo;t want to stick around for that heartache. They&rsquo;d rather watch the guys they enjoy, no matter what team they are on.</p>

<p>Also, contextless Twitter highlights are way too emphasized now.</p>

      <label for="llj2dsk" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a product of how they market the game, which is player-focused, so they&rsquo;re constantly convincing fans that players are elite and special and better than we&rsquo;ve ever seen before.  Just watch any of the commercials and how they market playoff series, etc.  Every young player is marketed like they&rsquo;re the greatest player in franchise history.  This is at direct odds with lifting up past players and showing them reverence/repsect.  The marketing for the NBA and the discourse is generally just way more dramatic for all of these reasons.  They also treat the league like a soap opera more so than any other sports league, and this creates a heightened sense of emotion and drama for everything <em>current</em> versus anything that happened in the <em>past</em>.  It&rsquo;s especially true if you weren&rsquo;t around to experience what happened in the past.</p>

      <label for="llj19pp" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s because the NBA markets itself on the players being the best in the world. It&rsquo;s a strategy they&rsquo;ve used since the 80&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a strategy that has built them into what they are.</p>

<p>But they can&rsquo;t use that kind of marketing without perpetuating recency bias. Very rarely when something happens in the NBA is it actually the best thing ever, the NBA wants to keep hyping it like it is, because fans like to feel like they are a part of something great right now even if they&rsquo;re not.</p>

<p>Like, I just googled Dan Marino Yardage to look up an example, and first line on the top result is &ldquo;Although Marino played at a time when it wasn&rsquo;t easy to throw the ball&rdquo;</p>

<p>NFL fans have a much better appreciation for the difference in eras.
 People recognize that achievements like Marino passing for 5000 yards in the 80&rsquo;s was way more difficult than a player doing it today.</p>

<p>Whereas NBA fans tend to do the opposite.  &ldquo;Yeah so and so averaged 30 points but he did it against plumbers!&rdquo;, while totally ignoring how much the rule changes of today have elevated offense.</p>

<p>Which is why for me personally all GOAT discussions are centered around how good a player was relative to his competition at the time. If you want to pick the best player, just look at the most recent season&rsquo;s MVP or FMVP.</p>

<p>What matters to me is, was their in-game performance consistently better than their competition? Did they win? Did their peers think they were on the same level? Individual accolades and counting stats obviously factor in, but only as a tiebreaker IMO.</p>

      <label for="lljf5lw" class="commentText"><p>You definitely barely follow it. 5 years ago? Nah, those guys aren&rsquo;t from this long forgotten era that couldn&rsquo;t keep up.</p>

<p>Hockey has huge distinct changes throughout it&rsquo;s history though. Defensive revolution happened from around 94 to 05 called the dead puck era. Then they changed the rules making defense harder, and scoring exploded. Then they experimented with goalie pad size changes and scoring got harder again, before they shrunk down the pad sizes to its current level</p>

<p>The best players of the 80s would have no issue with today&rsquo;s game, but their numbers are definitely still inflated. Goalies are they only distinct position that has gotten way better overall throughout the years. The popularization of the butterfly stance with bigger pads has made them way better way more consistently. Other than that, yeah guys like McDavid, MacKinnion, Matthews, and Kucherov are all timers  already, but it&rsquo;s not as though Gretzky, no matter how humble he&rsquo;s always been, LeMieux or any of those guys couldn&rsquo;t hang and still be the best/near the top of today&rsquo;s league. That&rsquo;s just nonsense</p>

<p>Same goes with NBA you guys scale this shit like it&rsquo;s anime power scaling acting like players only get stronger, taller, and more athletic over time which was never true. You all barely pay attention to what is actually changing within the league. Moreso now than ever the non-athletes are thriving because of the importance of 3 pointers and floor spacing. Some (not all) of the top players in the league today aren&rsquo;t impressive athletes in the NBA for any era, but are polished in all facits of the game, and thrive by having great court vision and great BBIQ. Things aren&rsquo;t just increasing on a yearly basis or some I&rsquo;m shit, the game is changing and players/coaches are adapting to the ever changing rules, and philosophies.</p>

<p>people really see anything lebron does and get mad and argue that jordan or kobe did it better. like just stfu and enjoy it. i don&rsquo;t think fans that do this truly enjoy basketball.</p>

      <label for="llipo00" class="commentText"><p>Seeing this question come up a lot.</p>

<p>I think the desire to compare players from different eras is more prevalent in basketball basically because a basketball team only has five players, so if one of them is clearly head and shoulders above everyone else, it really pops out. In baseball or football, there&rsquo;s a much more clear cut way to say who the best defenders are, and it&rsquo;s much less noticable when one single player is making most of the difference because there are just more bodies out there.</p>

<p>This results in it being quite easy to spot who the best players are. In fact it&rsquo;s usually so obvious that people actually get into heated arguments over whether this guy is the number four player on earth or actually the number seven player on earth.</p>

<p>So when you start ranking the players today, the next logical step is to rank them all time. That&rsquo;s just more seemingly possible with basketball players than it is with players in most other team sports.</p>

<p>Fwiw, I&rsquo;ve never really been a fan of comparing eras, mostly because people overdo it on both ends.</p>

<p>Fans of old heads mythologize them and their era, way more than is justified. But fans of the modern game tend to be way too dismissive of older guys. Like I&rsquo;ve seen people say Larry Bird wouldn&rsquo;t make an all star team if he played today, which is just idiotic. But I&rsquo;ve also seen people say Jaylen Brown would dominate like MJ if he played in 1989, which is equally idiotic.</p>

<p>Baseball is a statistician’s sport though, and Wins Above Replacement makes it a lot easier to compare across eras than other sports. Lot of respect for history back to about 1947.</p>

<p>Football glazes a lot of older players tbh</p>

      <label for="lliyabi" class="commentText"><p>Torono Rapture, thank you for this refreshing link from Dominique Wilkens. Unfortunately, in sports, bluster and pride are propped up ahead of humility.</p>

<p>Wilkins&rsquo; thoughts are rational. Look, basketball is meant to be competitive and fun. Not divisive. Anthony Edward&rsquo;s, while talented, his commentary reeks of ignorance.</p>

<p>As Wilkens said in his piece; the game of basketball will continuously evolve over time.</p>

      <label for="lljfxmq" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s obvious to anyone over 18. The way the game is talked about has changed. There&rsquo;s no respect for bygone eras and old players now. Hot take culture melted many of you moron&rsquo;s brains to the point I saw a thread with MJ highlights and saw comments like &ldquo;this is nothing special, just Ja Morant&rsquo;s highlights&rdquo;. Many of you are soooooooooo attached to the concept that you&rsquo;re part of the greatest era, that you can&rsquo;t accept that any era before it had some of the best talent ever too. It&rsquo;s a fucking shame, and it&rsquo;s hilarious how many of you will simultaneously shit talk said culture but let it warp your peanut brains into the shape of an almond.</p>

      <label for="lljlqwt" class="commentText"><p>You know, with some other sports you have it much easier &hellip; if someone breaks the 100m freestyle swimming world record tomorrow, then you can say &ldquo;that guy is the fastest swimmer in the world right now&rdquo; and there would be no debate. Same goes with running the fastest 400m or lifting the most weight ever or throwing a javelin furthest away in the stadium. That&rsquo;s easy to understand because the rules are very basic, whoever runs fastest wins etc. Of course, you could argue that conditions might be different (swimsuits, wind speed, nutrition whatever), but those conditions usually tend to lead to better results in the present compared to the past. Sure, there are certain world records that haven&rsquo;t been broken in decades, probably explained by either execeptional athletes (hard to believe, given the technological progress and the attention given to nutrition etc) or dishonest performances (basically all of the records held by the former GDR athletes, or anyone else that doped). So, if you accept that for some disciplines the results are better now than they were 30 or 50 years ago, some might say it applies to basketball as well. LeBron James has to be better than Jordan or Edwards has to be better than Wilkins just because LeBron and Edwars are the present, while Jordan and Wilkins are the past. Unfortunately, basketball (or gymnastics, or ice-hockey, or tennis or any other sport that isn&rsquo;t constrained by a measurable condition like distance/time or length or whatever) doesn&rsquo;t work like that :) There is certainly a case to be made that the best basketball player played in the 90s (Jordan) or the best heavyweight boxer fought in the 70s (Ali), but that&rsquo;s also hard to accept for people that live in the present. I guess one can assume that well, if swimming or computers or medicine are faster/better now, so should be everything else. I don&rsquo;t really have an opinion on that, but I stand with Wilkinson on that one: nobody is bigger than the game :)</p>

<p>I totally agree with Nique that it&rsquo;s silly to compare across generations in general, but it&rsquo;s extra silly to have that debate when you&rsquo;re still 23 and the most notable thing you&rsquo;ve done is dunk on Yuta Watanabe.</p>

<p>No one is genuinely arguing that Ant wouldn&rsquo;t dominate if you could magically drop him into 80&rsquo;s competition, it&rsquo;s such a narrow-minded argument to make. I&rsquo;d bet anything that in 40 year&rsquo;s the best players would be able to cook whatever prime Ant looks like if you magically dropped them into the 2020&rsquo;s NBA. The game will continue to evolve and improve.</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t misconstrue this as Ant hate, I love him on the court.</p>

      <label for="lliuctp" class="commentText"><p>Tatum an nba champ and top ten ten player was struggling against a slightly different rule set in the Olympics. Do these nba players realize how much their games would change if they called palming, hand checks and travels. Players nowadays legit are playing with one extra step and numerous others rules which allows them to appear more skilled. What can Anthony Edwards do skill wise or dribble wise that any pg couldn’t do in the 90s. Y’all think Vince Carter can’t dribble like Anthony Edwards? Tmac had even better handles. The hesi carry that Durant does which allows him to get off his shot, yall think tmac couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>The next generation should be allowed to take four steps and let’s see them create moves never imagined and then watch them take a shit on our current players for not being able to do them.</p>
