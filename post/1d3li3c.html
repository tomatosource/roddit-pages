<p>Below that there&rsquo;s a pretty big cluster of guys and you could put Tatum pretty much anywhere inside it, and it all depends on how much you value team performance, individual accolades, and health </p>

<p>Tatum, SGA, Embiid, Kawhi, KD, Steph, Brunson, AD, Ant, Lebron, Booker</p>

<p>People are way too quick to add people in who are hot one or two years without any kind of follow up or consistency. That group sans Booker is rising for sure but I need to see that high level of play sustained for longer before I’m willing to put them with that other group.</p>

<p>Like that next tier should really just be Embiid, Kawhi, Tatum, Steph, AD, and LeBron.</p>

      <label for="l68utb3" class="commentText"><p>Book has been very consistent for years lol, go look at his numbers, just put up 27 and 7 on great efficiency, he’s pretty much put up 25ppg+ for 7 seasons is a row, has back to back 27 ppg seasons and finished 4th in mvp voting 2 years ago. Also averages 28ppg on 60%TS for his playoff career and has like double Tatum’s career playoff 40pt games in half the games and same amount as Steph in like 100 less games. He’s been very consistent for years now, If 25ppg+ in 7 straight seasons isn’t consistent then I’m not really sure what consistency is, it’s not like he’s in his 4th year the dude has been in the league 9 seasons now. He was better than edwards pretty much across the board this year statistically, he’s been doing it for years it’s not like he’s had 2 good seasons. Edwards and Brunson is understandable because neither have been bonafide stars very long, back to back 1st team all nba seasons from SGA is pretty damn awesome too and he’s very consistent in general as a player.</p>

Yes, he&rsquo;s basically always had a very solid team around him but I don&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;s asked to do a lot more than what he already has. As a Mavs fan, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t get the title this year because I&rsquo;m hoping we can go get it, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t think the Celtics can&rsquo;t get one with Tatum. He&rsquo;s incredible.</p>

      <label for="l68kaiw" class="commentText"><p>Embiid is always considered a lock on these lists and then without fail cakes his pants in the playoffs every year.</p>

<p>Bro turns in the kind of playoff games that people will rip into Tatum for year after year and it just gets swept under the rug because he’s never in a big enough spotlight for it to be discussed further.</p>

<p>If he’s a consensus top 5 player then at some point he should be able to will a team past the second round like every other player in that conversation has done. It’s not just his team letting him down, his game just does not translate to the next level based on a mountain of evidence at this point</p>

      <label for="l699o0p" class="commentText"><p>And this argument doesn&rsquo;t even get into the topic of availability. Tatum was drafted 3 years after Embiid and he&rsquo;s played 80 more regular season games. He&rsquo;s also never missed a playoff game; Embiid missed 8 due to injury. I could also count all the FIBA games, but point is JT is always available.</p>

He’s the best player on a stacked team that calls for him to be unselfish, incredibly balanced and well rounded. And if you look at Lebrons numbers that season it’s pretty damn close to what Tatum has done this year. And that’s PEAK Lebron. Tatum gets too much hate.</p>

<p>Tatum is just not the “absolute best” at a particular skill, but is top tier at basically everything. I know haters will always hate, but I’m hopeful Jayson finally gets some proper respect if the Celtics win it all this year</p>

      <label for="l68925g" class="commentText"><p>I genuinely think the biggest reason people can’t really appreciate Tatum is bc he doesn’t have any single game-breaking skill or attribute</p>

<p>Jokic and Luka’s scoring and court vision, Embiid’s touch and agility at his size, Giannis’ physique and athleticism, KD’s combo of size and skill, Curry’s shooting, LeBron’s athleticism and IQ - they’re all nearly unstoppable, unteachable traits that are easy for a fan to identify and make them “generational.” even SGA has like a near superhuman ability to create dribble penetration and touch the paint against almost any defense</p>

<p>Tatum doesn’t have a single S-tier ability or trait like other top-end guys have. but he’s A-tier at literally everything you can ask a guy to do on a basketball court, unlike the other top players who almost all have some things they are B or even C-tier at on the court. when you put all those A-tier skills together you get an arguably top 5 player</p>

Personally I think Tatum&rsquo;s a top 5 player, but I still have him out of the top group of players because he just hasn&rsquo;t shown the same level of control over the game as the top 3 guys have.</p>

      <label for="l68acgy" class="commentText"><p>I’ve watched way more SGA than Tatum, but that said, SGA can also do everything well. Tatum’s a better rebounder, possibly a better defender. Shai’s a slightly better playmaker. The big difference is scoring. Tatum’s a very good scorer, but Shai scores with higher efficiency than Tatum on higher usage. Shai’s really in a league of his own when it comes to his combination of scoring volume and efficiency (Jokic has better efficiency on lower volume, Luka has more volume with less efficiency)</p>

      <label for="l68liso" class="commentText"><p>Tatum is a better POA defender than SGA by far. He’s much stronger and can hold his ground. SGA’s defense is overrated due to the steals and playing passing lanes, he never takes the top assignment like a Kawhi would, but SGA is treated as such. Although with Jrue/White Tatum is now taking the third or fourth best player on defense so I guess the argument is pointless since none of them ever take the top assignment anymore.</p>

<p>SGA is a more developed offensive player and also much more consistent. SGA’s floor for a bad game is higher than Tatums by a good bit.</p>

Tatum’s better, but honestly on most nights, I’d argue that SGA has the more important defensive role. His trapping and passing lane interference is critical for allowing OKC to play without size in the post. Against you, it didn’t really show because you never play through your bigs on offense, but against the Pelicans, the only reason Valenciunas didn’t completely kill us was that Shai made it very difficult for him to get or keep the ball in the post for more than a second or two.</p>

      <label for="l68d120" class="commentText"><p>SGA just had a playoff series performance that surpasses any series in Tatum’s entire career:</p>

<p>Shai vs Mavs:</p>

<ul>
<li>32.2 PTS, 8 REB, 7.3 AST, 1.2 STL, 2.3 BLK, 2.0 TO</li>
<li>50.7% FG, 55% 3FG, 83.3% FT, 60% TS</li>
</ul>

<p>Second highest scorer on his team was Jalen Williams — 17 PTS on 42% shooting. Shai didn’t get much help.</p>

<p>I looked through every Tatum playoff series in his career and none of them stack up to this.</p>

<p>Regular season isn’t a discussion either — SGA outperformed him the last two years in a row and this year SGA finished #2 in MVP voting, which is higher than Tatum has ever finished in his career.</p>

<p>Tatum being lower than SGA isn’t a slight either, SGA has simply proven himself as one of the absolute best on the world at this point.</p>

      <label for="l68htsh" class="commentText"><p>Shai is surely a better scorer and creator than Tatum (I think Tatum&rsquo;s passing <em>might</em> be better, but it&rsquo;s close enough and Shai creates more offense with his driving ability anyway). But I really think Tatum is in another tier defensively, he&rsquo;s so disruptive in help defense, both in the lane and at the rim. His series against the KD nets was one of the craziest clamps I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Like, this is almost peak Paul George level of wing defense, he&rsquo;s definitely up there with any of the wing All-Defense guys. The only other guy I&rsquo;ve seen that&rsquo;s significantly superior on that end is peak Kawhi.</p>

<p>So all of this is to say, I think it&rsquo;s hard to just look at counting stats and conclude that Shai had a better series than Tatum has ever had. A lot of what he does is not in the box score.</p>

<p>Tatum’s efficiency tends to drop in the playoffs. Right now he’s at 29% from three this playoff run.</p>

<p>Again — not saying Tatum is bad by any means, just that SGA has outperformed in both regular season and playoffs.</p>

<p>Its Jokic, Luka, Giannis, Tatum and then Shai and Ant. He should have never be given the MVP. It should have been Jokic and maybe this year it would have went to Luka if the media didnt feel like they had to make it right.</p>

People say he’s lucked into a great front office almost always putting competent teams around him, but it also is just that much easier when you literally don’t have to worry about fit ever. All Boston has ever had to worry about is accumulating the most talent possible which makes a GMs job soooo much easier.</p>

He&rsquo;s never really excelled at creating shots for his teammates. He&rsquo;s needed teammates who are capable of carrying more of the ball handling and facilitating compared to some of the other stars around the league.</p>

<p>The discourse around tatum rn is that he&rsquo;s on a team so good that he can be the 2nd best at times. Guaranteed if he was getting 25+ attempts a game and putting up 35+ on a 5-6 seed, people wouldn&rsquo;t argue he&rsquo;s top 5 and would be spamming &ldquo;Get him some help!!!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edit: I just realized my comment sounds like it could be about Luka. It isn&rsquo;t. Mavs are my 2nd favorite team</p>

<p>IF OKC doesn&rsquo;t win it all next year, he&rsquo;s gonna get the playoff choker slander and be consistently ranked around #7-10. That&rsquo;s just how NBA media and fandom works.</p>

<p>Also Guards/Forwards get treated differently than centers for both good and bad cause it’s a smaller players league where even the best center(Jokic) has Guard ability.</p>

<p>SGA will draw more conversation than Embiid and it might be positive now. will it stay that way has yet to be seen. They did this same thing with Booker and even Beal after Wall got hurt and Beal was looking(at the time) like could be a #1. That goes for Ant as well</p>

Pretty much every advanced stat you can find (VORP, BPM, EPM, LEBRON, WS) has Jokic, Giannis, Luka, and SGA top five, and none of them have Tatum top five. Every advanced stat has its limits, but when they literally all agree on something, it probably means that something is true</p>

<p>It bothers them that something like that could happen and I really don&rsquo;t get why.</p>

<p>EDIT: If anything, you think they&rsquo;d be more receptive to that possibility as it then opens the door for your team to believe more if you don&rsquo;t have that Top X player that was previously thought of as necessary to win a championship</p>

The exceptions are the 3 Pistons titles (although Zeke was arguably top 5 for the first 2, probably more like top 10 though) and the 14 Spurs (Duncan wasn’t top 5 anymore and Kawhi wasn’t top 5 yet).</p>

<p>That said, Tatum is enough in that range that it’s not as weird, it’s more like the 89 and 90 Pistons than it is the 04 Pistons</p>

<p>Before Jokic won people were questioning if his style of play and defensive deficits could be a championship calibre number 1 option. After the fact, the narrative changes and suddenly people are saying he was the undisputed number 1 since his first MVP, defining the early decade.</p>

I even have an example of it in my comment, Isiah Thomas arguably wasn’t even the best player on his team in 89 and 90, and yet the fact that there’s an argument for him in the top 5 over ringless guys like Malone, Barkley, and Ewing shows that rangz Erneh alter our perception of players throughout their whole careers.</p>

<p>Steve Nash probably wouldn’t have gotten near the same kind of grief he has over his MVPs if the Horry hip check doesn’t happen and he wins a chip in 07 (the Suns were beating the Cinderella Jazz team and baby LeBron). Instead people claim he had the worst MVPs ever.</p>

<p>The weirdness is rather exactly that our starters are basically 5 all-stars, only 1 is not in their prime (Jrue), and they fit together with limited overlap (you might want more of a handling-passing specialist or a taller/heavier 2-guard than Jrue or White, or a heavier C in some matchups, that&rsquo;s about it).</p>

<p>This is a profound front office success just as 95% of all championships require.</p>

      <label for="l68gqf7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’d say this is the most “balanced” title since the 14 Spurs. That team had 4 Hall of Famers in its closing lineup (counting that since Manu closed but didn’t always start) and then had Danny Green, one of the greatest role players of all time, as its 5th guy. The other team it has a lot in common with is the 04 Pistons, although this team at least has two bona fide stars and one no questions asked top 10 player unlike the 04 Pistons who were basically a team of nobodies (at the time at least) who humiliated the Lakers “Dream Team”.</p>

<p>The Celtics easily have the best starting 5 in the league when healthy. The only team that comes close is the Nuggets but that’s more because of how good they are as a unit, individually they don’t have anyone on the level of Brown and their third best player isn’t close to the level of Porzingis or White.</p>

      <label for="l686ydu" class="commentText"><p>Lol I mean fine I guess but would anyone seriously prefer Joel over the course of an entire season including playoffs for actually winning a title? Do people think Joel can ever string enough games together and then play four rounds together at a high level? Dude has never been past round 2 and has played 433 regular season games in 10!!! Seasons. Even removing the 2 DNP full seasons, we are still talking like 54 games per seasons and zero in the conference finals or finals.</p>

<p>Tatum was drafted 3 years later and has played 80 more regular season games and just about double the playoff games with 5 conference finals appearances and two finals appearances. Tatum is also averaging 24 in those 108 games and his sample is a little messy because it includes 3 rounds his rookie year and another 2 as a sophomore.</p>

<p>I’d rather have Joel for a single game in January or a random few months and he’s most dominant healthy but when is that exactly?</p>

If we are ranking by who is the best at playing basketball i put embiid 3rd maybe 2nd after luka and jokic. If we are talking about who you want on your roster the most obviously embiid is not top 5 since he has such bad injury luck.</p>

<p>I still have homerist faith we get one year were he stays healthy and we can string it all together but so far thats how i see the rank situation.</p>

      <label for="l68avta" class="commentText"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>At some point people here have to understand that the gap in talent between guys ranked 4-10 are barely there at all.</p>

<p>Of course, I a Celtics fan, is going to put Tatum in my Top 5. Because I watch every game he plays, and see the little things he does / stuff that doesn’t get put on a stat sheet. I don’t do that for guys that aren’t on my team, in fact I typically only watch other teams play when the playoffs are on and I have nothing better to do.</p>

<p>Most people here who watch games at all, are like that for their own team. So I have zero issue with a OKC fan saying SGA &amp;gt; Tatum, or any other fanbase who does the same with their own guy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I feel like stuff like this gets lost in history and nostalgia. Like if the Celtics win this year and Tatum gets finals MVP, 20 years down the line people will say “obviously Tatum was a top 5 player!” but we kind of tend to rewrite history based on its results. Like was Duncan a consensus top 5 player in his 2nd season? Was Isiah Thomas considered a consensus top 5 player? History now says Dirk was a top 5 player but I can promise you that was not the consensus at the time. He was viewed as a playoff choker until his championship season. Dr J was an icon but was he a top 5 player in 1983, there was some phenomenal players that year? Chauncey Billups and Paul Pierce obviously not. 2006 Heat are an interesting example as well. Was Kawhi already a top 5 player in 2014? He didn’t even make his first all star team until 2 years later.</p>

<p>Obviously the Kobe’s Jordan’s LeBron’s etc. and top of the top players tend to win a lot of the championships. But we misremember a lot of history where we think that caliber of player is the only one that wins championships</p>

The Celtics are offering up #10, #41, #45, #75, and #93. Two stars plus role players vs. a deeper team that doesn&rsquo;t light up the marquee. &ldquo;People want him to be better than that&rdquo; suggests that people prefer heliocentrism over careful team construction, which I guess the ratings suggests that they do, but still, the &lsquo;04 Pistons beating Shaq + Kobe + ring chasers was one of the NBA&rsquo;s all-time feel-good stories for a reason.</p>

<p>The guy that is First Team All NBA (5 Players)…3 years in a row…is not top 5…</p>

<p>Same age as SGA &amp;gt; More wins than SGA (loaded roster take doesn’t work when you realize his Big 3 was Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart…
both of whom the media negatively cover(ed) to great extents)…More All NBAs than SGA…More playoff success…better shooting numbers…better rebounding…more PPG in 5 year window…comparable upper-class to elite level defense (with Tatum being able to guard forwards/centers…SGA just got smoked by Derrick Jones Jr a week ago.)</p>

<p>SGA has the advantage in maybe playmaking being a point guard?</p>

<p>If you needed to start a franchise today, what makes SGA the clear cut choice over Tatum is my question…</p>

<p>Giannis: shooting and closing
Shai: 3 point shooting
Luka: defense
Jokic: defense
Embiid: health/making it past second round</p>

<p>Tatum can guard 1-4 at a high level and some small 5s and is a highly durable 3 level scorer and a good passer and rebounder.</p>

<p>He gets dinged for having a good supporting cast and being less ball dominant than other players. If tatum played on a worse team he would put up better stats.</p>

      <label for="l68mni5" class="commentText"><p>I get where Lowe’s going and I don’t disagree, I also don’t think these endless ranking conversations are that useful. What’s maybe more valuable is what the floor and ceiling on these guys is, and that’s the most important thing for me with Tatum as a Celtics fan. Tatum can be, and regularly is, the best player on the floor. He’s not every night, nor as consistently as say, Luka, but he’s absolutely capable of getting there and hanging around long enough to win many playoff series.</p>

<p>Plus, he doesn’t get enough credit to my eye for his growth picking his spots and expanding and contracting his game to fit the team, the matchup and the moment. The Cs have so much talent all five starters have had to do this to some degree, but it’s hardest for the first option, and despite the periodic wtf shot selection he’s really good about hanging back and stepping up when he senses the need</p>

      <label for="l68fei3" class="commentText"><p>I mean what&rsquo;s there to argue here, the top 4 of Jokic, Doncic, Giannis, and maybe Embiid are just so good, after that it could be anyone.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget he&rsquo;s a double double machine flirting with triple double lots of time, give him the usage rate of Embiid or Brunson he&rsquo;s gonna average far more than he is now, but the Celtics aren&rsquo;t built like those team.</p>

      <label for="l68gyvx" class="commentText"><p>It’s not easy to judge Tatum v Luka/Embiid/etc. Tatum is asked to do less because the Celtics are a juggernaut of a team, but Tatum is pretty incredible at what he does.</p>

<p>He’s a top-tier player.</p>

      <label for="l68i2pr" class="commentText"><p>Crazy how negative the narrative is about a dude who lost 2 games the entire playoffs, is averaging 26, 10 and 6 with elite defense and despite “underwhelming” efficiency, hes actually had a better TS% than Luka in the playoffs. Tatum somehow gets top 3 player expectations placed onto him… but hes somehow barely a top 10 player lmao. You definitely cant take him over Jokic, Giannis seems clearly above him as well. But after that you can start at least making arguments, especially if you value off ball ability and defense</p>

      <label for="l684qco" class="commentText"><p>I think he’s 5th but 5-8 is all debatable. He is undoubtedly above Embiid who he has beaten over and over his whole career and KD who he completely bottled up and smacked in a sweep. Argue about the rest though</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s clearly 5th and maybe 4th if you want to discount Embiid never being healthy. SGA still needs some miles before being put ahead a guy that has accomplished everything Tatum has when it matters.</p>
