Magic&rsquo;s Finals MVP is cool, but thats a small sample size, and he didn&rsquo;t win Rookie of the year .. and it wasn&rsquo;t even close.  He wasn&rsquo;t All NBA either (whereas Bird was First Team all NBA The same season as a rookie).  The finals MVP was in large part because of KAJ&rsquo;s injury (he was on track to win it but sprained his ankle).  Magic had a great game no doubt.</p>

<p>Clearly Wilt, he had the greatest rookie season of any sport.</p>

But Bird was the biggest change by quite a ways.</p>

Nobody was picking Iverson over him, unless Iverson grew another foot and could anchor a defense. The #2 pick in the draft was Marcus Camby, who wasn&rsquo;t considered even close to Duncan was a prospect.</p>

<p>Jerry West even said he would go #1 after his sophomore year. He didn&rsquo;t really develop a ton between the end of his 2nd year and the end of his 4th. He just stayed in school because he had promised his dying mom on her deathbed that he would graduate.</p>

      <label for="lkxzyw6" class="commentText"><p>Bellamy’s a weird case because he put up monster numbers on a pretty wretched team but the consensus at the time was they were relatively empty stats. So take that for what you will.</p>

<p>Unseld is definitely the opposite of that. He’s the player for baseball nerds/junkies. Take all the things that a lot of people find annoying when certain fans talk about the peripheral stuff Gobert does to make his teams good offensive teams, now what if the people geeking out about it were actually the majority of players in the league. Because that’s essentially what Unseld was. He set monster screens, deft dribble hand offs, constantly hit cutters, crashed the offensive glass, and had a sweet bail out jumper when he wanted to bust it out (on top of being tough as nails and no nonsense). Like to really appreciate Unseld, you have to find game film of him and line that up with what other stars in the league were saying about him. There are a few people (writers, analysts, what have you) who will throw out that Willis Reed should’ve won the MVP, and the first person who would’ve actively disagreed with them is Willis Reed. Oddly enough, Unseld probably had tighter contention for Rookie of the Year than MVP that season.</p>

<p>He was quite good, but I think Kareem, Moses Malone, Julius Erving, George Gervin, and Larry Bird were better in his rookie year. I think Magic is close but I wouldn’t say he was better than those 5 from an individual standpoint (although accolades wise, a FMVP does make his rookie year better than Bird). </p>

<li><p>Magic wasn’t even remotely close to the best player on his team.</p></li>

<li><p>Magic is really only included in these discussions because he ended up becoming one the 10 or so best players ever and people have tendency to flatten player’s careers. And the only reason his rookie season is elevated in dramatic fashion (for instance, the Rookie the Year race really wasn’t close at all that season) is because he happened to have the absolute best game of his life up to that point at the literal most memorable moment playing in what would be the last game of the season. His season taken in totality is a great rookie season but doesn’t sniff the rarified air or being one of the best ever.</p></li>

<p>Wes was great, Wilt set new records for points and rebounds. Not rookie records, NBA records. His average of 27 rpg is still second all-time (behind himself and ahead of himself) while his 37.6 ppg is forth all-time (behind himself, himself and himself).

<p>Actually, Lebron is my second GOAT. But his rookie season is not in contention too.</p>

<p>The Ones who are in contention are:</p>

<p><strong>Wilt</strong>- BEST player in the league as a Rookie. Rookie MVP</p>

<p><strong>KAJ</strong>- Arguably The Best Player in the league as a Rookie. 3rd Placer in MVP Race.</p>

<p><strong>Magic</strong>- Has a slight case because he was Finals MVP as a rookie. But the fact that he lost to Larry for ROY make his case a little weaker.</p>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>- also has a slight case for turning around a Celtics team from 20+ wins team to 50+ win team.</p>

<p>PS:</p>

<p>As much as I love both MJ and Lebron. Their rookie selves were not in contention for the best player in the league.</p>

      <label for="lkxytz4" class="commentText"><p>David Thompson’s 1975-76 rookie year in the ABA is one of the best ever. </p>

<p>That was the ABA’s last season and had top end talent very comparable to the NBA (the difference being the current East vs West, which is not that big of a difference). </p>

<p>He was the first pick in the NBA draft too but chose the ABA. It’s kind of lost in history though because he went from being a legitimate top 20 all time candidate after his first 4 years to being an afterthought. </p>

      <label for="lky2zs1" class="commentText"><p>As a rookie Elgin Baylor averaged 25/15/5 in the regular season then in the playoffs beat the defending champions Hawks in the WCF.</p>

<p>Was 3rd in MVP voting and made 1st team all-NBA</p>

<p>But most importantly he took his team that was one of the least talented in the league, to the finals and even lead the playoffs in scoring.</p>

      <label for="lky4t1u" class="commentText"><p>Stats aside, Donovan Mirchell had an amazing rookie season for us. We had just lost Gordon Hayward to free agency. Donovan was a mid first round pick. We were supposed to be bad that year. Ended up making the playoffs, won first round against a tough Oklahoma City team that had Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony. And Donovan was the leader through all of it.</p>

<p>So like I said,  despite his overall numbers, he took a team that had no business making the playoffs and took us past round one against some Hall of Famers.</p>

<p>Not saying he had the greatest rookie season ever, but it&rsquo;s up there.</p>
