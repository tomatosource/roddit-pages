Magic&rsquo;s Finals MVP is cool, but thats a small sample size, and he didn&rsquo;t win Rookie of the year .. and it wasn&rsquo;t even close.  He wasn&rsquo;t All NBA either (whereas Bird was First Team all NBA The same season as a rookie).  The finals MVP was in large part because of KAJ&rsquo;s injury (he was on track to win it but sprained his ankle).  Magic had a great game no doubt.</p>

<p>Clearly Wilt, he had the greatest rookie season of any sport.</p>

      <label for="ll2naq6" class="commentText"><p>When he comes up, it;&rsquo;s bizarre.  Like, they use assists and goals as &ldquo;points&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You could take away his goals (or maybe his assists?  Maybe either one?) and he&rsquo;d STILL have the most points.</p>

<p>In fantasy hockey leagues, you could not draft Gretzky.  You could draft his goals, or his assists.  And those two usually went 1st and 2nd.</p>

<p>He and his brother have the most points scored for any pair of brothers.</p>

<p>His brother got like 2.</p>

<p>I never played, but the town I grew up in sure did.  By the time I left town in the eary 90&rsquo;s, the HS team had won state 4 times and lost in teh finals against the only other program to win it 4 times when the little brother of a friend of mine missed a goal in overtime by banging it off the crossbar.</p>

<p>And the college team won the national title 4 times in that same span of time.</p>

<p>So yeah, a big hockey town.  Could not avoid knowing something about it no matter how hard you tried :)</p>

      <label for="ll46494" class="commentText"><p>Gretzky had an incredible rookie season, winning MVP, but taken in itself it was a “mortal” MVP, with impressive but not yet insane numbers. Wilt on the other hand broke both the NBA scoring and rebounding season records as a rookie. Of course Gretzky came in at a younger age, so it also depends on if you should take that into account (FWIW Magic was similarly younger than Bird when they were rookies)</p>

      <label for="lkzllwe" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a Celtic  and this is r/nba.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have a star who isn&rsquo;t underrated tbh.</p>

<p>Bill Russell played against postmen and plumbers, although Wilt was an incredible player who gets a pass for playing (and having less success) in the same era. 2 championships against plumbers is undeniable greatness, but 11 isn&rsquo;t as impressive.</p>

<p>Saw someone the other day claiming Magic Johnson basically invented the no-look pass. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbq_w634tbY" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s very common for people to forgett the Houdini of the Hardwood.</a></p>

<p>Havlicek was prime Kawhi with a Kareem-like durability. Also pioneered the star-level 6MOTY role, 30-40 years before Ginobli&hellip; but he&rsquo;s also one of the most forgotten stars in NBA history.</p>

<p>Larry Bird was considered the best player of all time when he played, before handing the mantle over to Jordan. However he&rsquo;s since been moved down the list for guys who preceded him. He was placed head and shoulders above Kareem by people who saw them both play, but now it&rsquo;s Kareem that usually takes that 3rd spot in all-time rankings.</p>

<p>Paul Pierce is a top 20 all-time scorer who famously went toe-to-toe with historic players like Iverson, with LeBron also listing him as his #1 rival earlier in his career. He&rsquo;s Mr. Poopy Butthole now and should feel ashamed for putting himself on the same level as guys he regularly competed with.</p>

<p>Jayson Tatum is a rich man&rsquo;s Tobias Harris, leading Boston to more playoff wins than most of his &ldquo;clearly better&rdquo; peers combined.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown is a bad on-ball player but also somehow a bad off-ball player, which is kind of crazy considering he&rsquo;s averaged 27ppg for an entire season. Also his game isn&rsquo;t really built for the playoffs, again weird because he&rsquo;s one of the few stars in the league who actually sees a boost in his PPG and TS% once entering the post-season.</p>

      <label for="lkxzyw6" class="commentText"><p>Bellamy’s a weird case because he put up monster numbers on a pretty wretched team but the consensus at the time was they were relatively empty stats. So take that for what you will.</p>

<p>Unseld is definitely the opposite of that. He’s the player for baseball nerds/junkies. Take all the things that a lot of people find annoying when certain fans talk about the peripheral stuff Gobert does to make his teams good offensive teams, now what if the people geeking out about it were actually the majority of players in the league. Because that’s essentially what Unseld was. He set monster screens, deft dribble hand offs, constantly hit cutters, crashed the offensive glass, and had a sweet bail out jumper when he wanted to bust it out (on top of being tough as nails and no nonsense). Like to really appreciate Unseld, you have to find game film of him and line that up with what other stars in the league were saying about him. There are a few people (writers, analysts, what have you) who will throw out that Willis Reed should’ve won the MVP, and the first person who would’ve actively disagreed with them is Willis Reed. Oddly enough, Unseld probably had tighter contention for Rookie of the Year than MVP that season.</p>

Back in the day when we played basketball on the playground, everybody would call themselves by the names of pro players. We had a Kareem, a Bob McAdoo, a couple three Earl the Pearls, a Bob Love, and about 10 Dr. J&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>But I was the only Wes Unseld. I was a big Bullets fan, and he was my guy. I about gave myself a hernia trying to throw that overhead two-handed outlet pass that he made look so easy.</p>

I know you got downvoted but Duke Zion was really good, which is why he was so good right away as a rookie despite missing most of the season. The issue is he never improved the way most 19-20 year olds improve since then. </p>

<p>I would also consider AD but AD wasn’t as good right away the first half of his rookie year so not sure he was top 50. </p>

<p>Wes was great, Wilt set new records for points and rebounds. Not rookie records, NBA records. His average of 27 rpg is still second all-time (behind himself and ahead of himself) while his 37.6 ppg is forth all-time (behind himself, himself and himself). He was also the ASG MVP back when that meant something.</p>

<p>That was the ABA’s last season and had top end talent very comparable to the NBA (the difference being the current East vs West, which is not that big of a difference). </p>

<p>He was the first pick in the NBA draft too but chose the ABA. It’s kind of lost in history though because he went from being a legitimate top 20 all time candidate after his first 4 years to being an afterthought. </p>

<p>He was quite good, but I think Kareem, Moses Malone, Julius Erving, George Gervin, and Larry Bird were better in his rookie year. I think Magic is close but I wouldn’t say he was better than those 5 from an individual standpoint (although accolades wise, a FMVP does make his rookie year better than Bird). </p>

<li><p>Magic wasn’t even remotely close to the best player on his team.</p></li>

<li><p>Magic is really only included in these discussions because he ended up becoming one the 10 or so best players ever and people have tendency to flatten player’s careers. And the only reason his rookie season is elevated in dramatic fashion (for instance, the Rookie the Year race really wasn’t close at all that season) is because he happened to have the absolute best game of his life up to that point at the literal most memorable moment playing in what would be the last game of the season. His season taken in totality is a great rookie season but doesn’t sniff the rarified air or being one of the best ever.</p></li>

      <label for="lky199j" class="commentText"><p>What is interesting is Wilkes arguably had the greatest game of his life (and he had won championships at UCLA and with the Warriors prior to that) that game too and no one remembers it. </p>

<p>Watching that game, Magic was obviously the main guy but Wilkes hit some big time shots against a 76ers squad with elite wing defenders. </p>

      <label for="lkxqtvt" class="commentText"><p>MJ is my GOAT. But no, imo his rookie season is not in contention.</p>

<p>Actually, Lebron is my second GOAT. But his rookie season is not in contention too.</p>

<p>The Ones who are in contention are:</p>

<p><strong>Wilt</strong>- BEST player in the league as a Rookie. Rookie MVP</p>

<p><strong>KAJ</strong>- Arguably The Best Player in the league as a Rookie. 3rd Placer in MVP Race.</p>

<p><strong>Magic</strong>- Has a slight case because he was Finals MVP as a rookie. But the fact that he lost to Larry for ROY make his case a little weaker.</p>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>- also has a slight case for turning around a Celtics team from 20+ wins team to 50+ win team.</p>

<p>PS:</p>

<p>As much as I love both MJ and Lebron. Their rookie selves were not in contention for the best player in the league.</p>

      <label for="ll4pe4f" class="commentText"><p><strong>Wilt Chamberlain</strong>, <strong>Kareem Abdul Jabbar</strong>, <strong>Oscar Robertson</strong> - played in a 6-footer plumbers and farmers era. Sorry but they never gonna do it in todays NBA.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Jordan</strong> - this one&rsquo;s pretty legit.</p>

<p><strong>Magic</strong> - played alongside prime Kareem LOL</p>

<p><strong>David Robinson</strong> - 25 years old his rookie year</p>

<p><strong>Tim Duncan</strong>- came to an already established spurs with david robinson.</p>

<p>So by your hater logic <strong>LeBron James</strong> and <strong>Shaq</strong> have bad rookie years coz they missed the playoffs?? Best rookies usually goes to the worst team trying to rebuild come on use your brain. Nobody expects any rookie to fight for contention unless he has vet teammates.</p>

<p><strong>Wemby</strong> averaged 21 pts/10 rebs/4 asts, battled against top superstars and <strong>led the league in blocks</strong>. He was the unanimous ROY, 2nd in DPOY. Had many 30+pt games, career-high of 40 points, 5x5 game, triple doubles, <em>almost</em> quadruple doubles, all while playing under 30 minutes and having sochan as his backcourt&hellip;  yet you wanted a competitive team? you out of yo mind buddy? If you&rsquo;re that desperate about winning, go yell at them ringless vets like Embiid or Lillard. Wemby is 20 years old idiotic dumbo.</p>

<p>Clipper games became appointment viewing just because of Blake. He was an All-Star as a rookie. He dominated NBA headlines even over the Heatles first season, and D-Rose’s MVP campaign. He put up 23/12/4 and played every game that season.</p>

      <label for="lkzjlwi" class="commentText"><p>I feel like any rookie winning FMVP is incredible… even if they were a non-factor before the series (which Magic wasn’t). It’s one thing to win a championship as a rookie because you got drafted to a great team. It’s another to actually deliver at that stage, and so soon.</p>

      <label for="ll1yl4z" class="commentText"><p>How about <strong>Bill Russell</strong>?</p>

<p>He started his rookie season in the NBA late because he was captaining the US Mens Basketball Team in the Olympics, where they won the gold; in fact, Russell&rsquo;s 1956 team still holds the record in Olympic history for largest average margin of victory.</p>

<p>He is an immediate force on the boards, leading the league right out of the gate with 19.6 RPG.</p>

<p>He was 7th in MVP voting, nabbing two votes. This was back when players voted for the MVP, and you couldn&rsquo;t vote for anyone on your own team.</p>

<p>And he was a force on the boards in the postseason. He averaged 28 RPG in their sweep of the Royals, and then averaged 22.9 RPG in the seven game Finals series against the Hawks. He pulled down 244 rebounds in the postseason. The next most was Bob Pettit, who had 168.</p>

      <label for="ll331kd" class="commentText"><p>It is honestly Wilt by a country mile but a lot of that has to the with the era really. The amount of shots taken back then that were obviously inefficient is crazy that rebounding averages in that era is the highest.</p>

<p>Oscar and Kareem&rsquo;s also benefit quite a bit from that style of play in that era which leaves the more modern contenders Jordan, Magic/Bird, Shaq and David Robinson as the more sensible ones to really mull over.</p>

<p>Magic was the FMVP and champion so it should go to him but that Lakers team was already pretty solid so I cannot go all in and say he&rsquo;s inarguably had the greatest Rookie Season.</p>

      <label for="lky4t1u" class="commentText"><p>Stats aside, Donovan Mirchell had an amazing rookie season for us. We had just lost Gordon Hayward to free agency. Donovan was a mid first round pick. We were supposed to be bad that year. Ended up making the playoffs, won first round against a tough Oklahoma City team that had Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony. And Donovan was the leader through all of it.</p>

<p>So like I said,  despite his overall numbers, he took a team that had no business making the playoffs and took us past round one against some Hall of Famers.</p>

<p>Not saying he had the greatest rookie season ever, but it&rsquo;s up there.</p>

      <label for="lkzr9kd" class="commentText"><p>it depends on the era, Wilt was definetly the best rookie in 60s, Kareem in 70s, Jordan in 80s, Robinson in 90s, Chris Paul
 in 00s, 2010s it&rsquo;s either Ben Simmons or Blake Griffin. Wembanyama is probably already locked in as 2020s</p>

      <label for="ll36gfi" class="commentText"><p>Michael Jordan put up 28.2p/6.5r/5.6a/2.4s/0.8b on 109 TS+ as a rookie. He came into the league and scored 28.2 ppg on 9% higher efficiency than league average and also had 2.4 steals per game.  There are several MVP-winning seasons with worse
statlines than this.</p>

<p>For context the MVP of that season was Larry Bird, his statline was 28.7p/10.5r/6.6a and 1.6s/1.2b on 108 TS+. In his rookie season, MJ was 3rd in PPG in the league behind Bernard King and Larry Bird. He was 4th in SPG, 2nd in Win Shares, 3rd in Win Shares per 48, 2nd in BPM, 2nd in VORP, he was basically a top 3 player in the league in his rookie campaign. </p>
