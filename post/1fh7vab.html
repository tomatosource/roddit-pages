    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Kawhi/Harden/Russ are  younger than Lebron/KD/Steph</p>

<p>But why do the first trio are washed former superstars now. But the latter trio of Lebron/KD/Steph are still in top 10 current players contention.</p>

<p><strong>Becasue of Injuries?</strong></p>

<p>Well, Lebron, KD, and Steph had bad injuries too. But still, they recovered and back in superstar form.</p>

<p>Why cant Kawhi/Harden/Russ do it?</p>

<p>Is it just that Lebron/KD/Steph doing longevity wise is not normal?</p>

<p>Or Kawhi/Harden/Russ just lacked the discipline and drive to keep in shape?</p>

<p><strong>Because of playstyle?</strong></p>

<p>Is playstyle a factor? Hmmm.🤔</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

      <label for="ln7vmas" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s really not that complicated, but you&rsquo;re mixing a bunch of things here. LeBron and Kawhi really belong in their own categories.</p>

<ul>
<li>Harden &amp; Russ: heavily relied on their first step to blow by defenders, so once that was gone, they declined pretty hard. Russ much more than Harden, since Harden still has his shooting ability</li>
<li>KD and Steph: don&rsquo;t rely that much on their first step, so while they&rsquo;ve declined athletically in similar ways to Harden and Russ, it hasn&rsquo;t hurt them as much.</li>
<li>LeBron: also declined athletically, but even a less athletic LeBron is still bigger, stronger, and more athletic than most of the league. He&rsquo;s declined a <em>lot</em> from his prime, but a steep decline from prime LeBron is still comfortably a top 10 player in the league</li>
<li>Kawhi: really should be in a boat with Steph and KD, there&rsquo;s not really much indication that he&rsquo;s declined more than they have when he&rsquo;s actually <em>on</em> the court, but he just can&rsquo;t fucking stay healthy. Injuries can lead to decline, but they&rsquo;re not the same thing.</li>

      <label for="ln7wri5" class="commentText"><p>All points true, but KD definitely relied on his first step and he still kind of does because with his improved shooting ability and sheer length that first step will always be dangerous, even if he’s not as quick.</p>

<p>But KDs offensive evolution is insane.</p>

      <label for="ln7yf93" class="commentText"><p>I mean, yeah, all great players rely on their first step to <em>some</em> degree. He and Steph have both notably dropped off their rim attempts the last couple years, which is part of why they aren&rsquo;t surefire top 5 players anymore— the decline is still happening, it&rsquo;s just not as sharp as it was for Harden or (especially) Russ because they make up for it with outlier shooting</p>

      <label for="ln7y6cv" class="commentText"><p>See I just don&rsquo;t buy that. People were saying he was intentionally letting himself get out of shape so the Rockets would trade him, but his first season on the Nets was one of the best of his career before he got hurt— I feel like people forget now, but there was legitimate and serious argument about who was the best player on that team between him and KD. I kind of think injuries just sapped his athleticism, it happens all the time</p>

      <label for="ln7vvxh" class="commentText"><p>Steph is the best 3pts shooter of all time, KD is one of the, if not the, best mid range shooter of all time with crazy size and coordination for that size, those things aged well.</p>

<p>Kawhi is still at that level while healthy, he just is basically never healthy for 10 months straight</p>

<p>Harden and Russ games in their primes were both really athletic based with all the driving they did, so they were always gonna age quicker, but truth is they basically were never the same after an injury.</p>

<p>Russ lost a ton of athleticism when he injured his quad in the bubble, and lost a ton of confidence because of that, the rest of his game declined too (besides his passing), he was never an all star after that injury. Also the game is becoming harder and harder for guys who can&rsquo;t shoot, and his shooting has gotten even worse</p>

<p>Harden got injured in the 2021 playoffs, and basically went from an MVP level guy to a borderline all star (partly because of the injury, partly because he wasn&rsquo;t in perfect shape).</p>

<p>Lebron is really the outlier, but hey he&rsquo;s Lebron</p>

Harden and Russ are mostly play style related but honestly, shouldn’t be a knock on them because the guys you are comparing them to are legends and the fact their game is still going strong is an anomaly it’s not normal at all. Outside of Harden’s absolute peak, him and Russ are just not on the level of those other guys, no shame about it.</p>

      <label for="ln7vvyd" class="commentText"><p>LeBron is just an anomaly in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>KD and Steph are two of the most efficient scorers from anywhere on the floor. They’ve always been finesse players who can hit a shot from anywhere so their athletic decline isn’t going to sharply impact their game like it does with others.</p>

<p>I think you’ll notice that all three of them have had an incline in jump shots as they’ve aged. They’re selective when driving to the hoop now.</p>

<p>Russ and Harden were all athleticism and motor and relatively inefficient shot chucking. And Kawhi’s knee is beyond cooked. He don’t even walk right. Bro’s been limping for years.</p>

<p>That’s my guess.</p>

Harden was probably the most skilled offensive guard that has played in the league for the past 20 years. He declined because he didn’t take care of himself and because he had to play absolutely massive minutes because he was always on garbage teams.</p>

<p>Kawaii&rsquo;s game would be seemingly be excellent for extending his prime. Unfortunately, his knees have an annual implosion.</p>
