<p>i remember the day the russ trade happened i was shaking my head because i thought it was such a huge overreaction to a season that ultimately went pretty well considering the injuries and the two-month offseason they had.</p>

      <label for="lozqgwg" class="commentText"><p>Nah ppl who said we didn&rsquo;t give him a chance didn&rsquo;t have to watch that shit day in day out.</p>

<p>Imagine going to work every day and spending 8 hours grinding fighting for an inch, sweating blood and tears for that inch. Then at the end of the shift this guy comes in, kicks over all the shit you built. Then laughs and tells you to just have fun and wish he could have helped you more. For two years!!!!!</p>

<p>It was actually unhealthy for us. Like legitimately I am not even exaggerating when I say I started going on the Lakers sub and there were post games where I felt like I was in a therapy support group for PTSD.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not even joking there were nights that were dark. To see the players I loved for my entire life defying the odds for an inch. Clawing for an 8th seed. Then this guy coming in and knocking it all down so the last 47 minutes you watched was for nothing. Then he goes on the post game and throws shade at everyone else, blaming everyone else, or worse, when he does the too cool to care shit.</p>

<p>It was that bad. It was legitimately bad for my health I will forever fucking hate that guy. Like you hear stories of guys beating their wife after their team loses a game or something and you think, wow what losers, no way anything is that serious. But like during the Westbrook period I was like. Alrite. I wouldn&rsquo;t. But I can see how it happens. This is the fucking shit they were watching.</p>

<p>That time he finally got benched for that one game. And he goes up to an exhausted bron and ad slumped on the bench as they were losing and hes just smiling going &ldquo;wish i could help you guys out there&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I would have slapped that guy if I was them. Holy shit. Playing below your contract is one thing. I get it, secure the bag. But man the lack of accountability and the way he would act like he&rsquo;s too cool to care as an emotional defensive mechanism.</p>

He also had to be a huge dick about it too and take 0 accountability or make any adjustments. There were probably close to a dozen games a season where they lose one possession games because  wb wanted to do a huge hero ball move to seal the game, fumbling it and then losing. Then he would go in the post game and say shit like just have fun, trying to play it off likes he&rsquo;s too cool to care. Knowing how hard everyone was trying to make a playoff push.</p>

<p>Russ was the issue and the person who wanted him acquired was the one to blame to.</p>

<p>It seems like he is still friends with Westbrook, so I doubt he would throw him under the bus and cause drama. But come on, you could tell by Durant&rsquo;s body language that he was often frustrated playing with West.</p>

<p>Besides he said &ldquo;I was tired of having to be the only guy that can make 3sI was tired of having to be the only guy that can make 3s&rdquo;, and Westbrook was shooting more than 5 attempts a game in the playoffs.</p>

<p>He has rep because he is a good teammate who really cares about his team. But Lebron has high bball IQ and should know that Westbrook was a bad option.</p>

<p>Remember Durant was using a burner so he could shit on Westbrook as much as he wanted to if he really thought that Westbrook was shit and Westbrook would in theory never know (of course we know now that Durant would leak his burner but I&rsquo;m speaking from his perspective when he made those comments).</p>

<p>Also should be noted that, this was after Westbrook made those aggressive &ldquo;cupcake&rdquo; posts that were clearly aimed at Durant so their friendship had already broken down at that point.  IIRC they didn&rsquo;t talk for quite some time after Durant went to GSW.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can be frustrated at someone and still think they&rsquo;re a excellent player.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>High bball IQ (or IQ in general) often doesn&rsquo;t take precedent over ego &amp; personal bias.</p>

<p>If I were to guess Lebron&rsquo;s thought process at the time it&rsquo;s probably something like &ldquo;I know Westbrook can&rsquo;t shoot but we&rsquo;re both such great players that we&rsquo;ll make it work anyway&rdquo; or something along those lines.</p>
