<p>It seems like he is still friends with Westbrook, so I doubt he would throw him under the bus and cause drama. But come on, you could tell by Durant&rsquo;s body language that he was often frustrated playing with West.</p>

<p>Besides he said &ldquo;I was tired of having to be the only guy that can make 3sI was tired of having to be the only guy that can make 3s&rdquo;, and Westbrook was shooting more than 5 attempts a game in the playoffs.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He has rep because he is a good teammate who really cares about his team. But Lebron has high bball IQ and should know that Westbrook was a bad option.</p>
