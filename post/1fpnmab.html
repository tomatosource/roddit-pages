<p>It seems like he is still friends with Westbrook, so I doubt he would throw him under the bus and cause drama. But come on, you could tell by Durant&rsquo;s body language that he was often frustrated playing with West.</p>

<p>Besides he said &ldquo;I was tired of having to be the only guy that can make 3sI was tired of having to be the only guy that can make 3s&rdquo;, and Westbrook was shooting more than 5 attempts a game in the playoffs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He has rep because he is a good teammate who really cares about his team. But Lebron has high bball IQ and should know that Westbrook was a bad option.</p>

<p>It seems like he is still friends with Westbrook, so I doubt he would throw him under the bus and cause drama. But come on, you could tell by Durant&rsquo;s body language that he was often frustrated playing with West.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember Durant was using a burner so he could shit on Westbrook as much as he wanted to if he really thought that Westbrook was shit and Westbrook would in theory never know (of course we know now that Durant would leak his burner but I&rsquo;m speaking from his perspective when he made those comments).</p>

<p>Also should be noted that, this was after Westbrook made those aggressive &ldquo;cupcake&rdquo; posts that were clearly aimed at Durant so their friendship had already broken down at that point.  IIRC they didn&rsquo;t talk for quite some time after Durant went to GSW.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides he said &ldquo;I was tired of having to be the only guy that can make 3sI was tired of having to be the only guy that can make 3s&rdquo;, and Westbrook was shooting more than 5 attempts a game in the playoffs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can be frustrated at someone and still think they&rsquo;re a excellent player.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has rep because he is a good teammate who really cares about his team. But Lebron has high bball IQ and should know that Westbrook was a bad option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>High bball IQ (or IQ in general) often doesn&rsquo;t take precedent over ego &amp; personal bias.</p>

<p>If I were to guess Lebron&rsquo;s thought process at the time it&rsquo;s probably something like &ldquo;I know Westbrook can&rsquo;t shoot but we&rsquo;re both such great players that we&rsquo;ll make it work anyway&rdquo; or something along those lines.</p>
