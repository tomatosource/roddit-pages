</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now that the Olympics are behind us, it&rsquo;s time to look ahead to the 2024-25 season.</p>

<p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to preview each team (grouped by <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake" target="_blank">tiers</a> ). In terms of predictions, we&rsquo;re going to avoid hot takes or bold predictions for the sake of drama and simply go with the most realistic outcome. The truth of the matter is: the biggest differentiator between expected success and results tends to be injury related, so it&rsquo;s difficult to peer into the crystal ball on that front. We&rsquo;re also going to balance every team&rsquo;s wins to be an even .500 across the league, which is something most outlets don&rsquo;t bother to do.</p>

<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s cast a look at the pecking order in the <strong>WESTERN CONFERENCE.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>TIER THREE: PLAYOFF CONTENDERS</strong></p>

<p><strong>(7) SACRAMENTO KINGS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>46-36</strong>, +1.8 point differential, # 9 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 13th on offense, 14th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: There are some slight concerns here in terms of analytics and regression. The King&rsquo;s point differential showed a team more in line with a <strong>44 win</strong> squad. Moreover, they benefited from good health. In fact, Domantas Sabonis and Harrison Barnes each played 82 games. On the plus side, opponents shot 38.7% from three against them (2nd best), which history suggests will regress some.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SF Harrison Barnes, PG Davion Mitchell</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SF DeMar DeRozan, SG Devin Carter &reg;, PG Jordan McLaughlin</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>It makes sense that Sacramento felt like they needed a spark and a big move. After all, they were healthy and still missed the playoffs last year.</p>

<p>Time will tell whether DeMar DeRozan is the right &ldquo;big move&rdquo;. DeRozan will be 35 in August, putting him on a different timeline than De&rsquo;Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis. He&rsquo;s also slightly duplicative of them from a skills perspective as all three thrive in the 2-point area. Still, there aren&rsquo;t many teams that can feature three legitimate 20 PPG scorers, so there&rsquo;s a chance that the trio keeps the team consistent and chugging along through the long slog of the regular season.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>The Kings didn&rsquo;t mind losing Davion Mitchell because they had a (hopefully) better version of him arriving in rookie Devin Carter. Unfortunately, Carter will miss time after a shoulder surgery. As a result, the Kings are lacking in perimeter defense, which will put some pressure on unheralded <strong>Keon Ellis</strong> to handle a large role. He certainly looked promising in the second half of the year. It&rsquo;s rare for a player to take his route to relevance (with a stop in Florida SouthWestern State College), but it&rsquo;s the mark of a good franchise if a team can isolate and develop talent through their farm system.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The Sacramento Kings have epitomized &ldquo;good but not great&rdquo; for the last few years, and I&rsquo;m not sure that DeMar DeRozan changes that math fundamentally. Whether <strong>45-37</strong> makes the playoffs this time around may depend on the teams around them.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>Vegas has listed the Kings&rsquo; over/under at 46.5. I&rsquo;d lean to the &ldquo;under&rdquo; here, but Mike Brown&rsquo;s a likable fellow so for his sake I&rsquo;ll <strong>stay away</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(8) LOS ANGELES LAKERS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>47-35</strong>, +0.6 point differential, # 7 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 15th on offense, 16th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: Based on the Lakers&rsquo; point differential, <strong>42 wins</strong> may have been a more expected result. Their starters (namely LeBron James and Anthony Davis) were all generally healthy as well, which in this case is more of a red flag. If they had missed extended time, last year&rsquo;s team could have been even worse.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SF Taurean Prince, PG Spencer Dinwiddie</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: coach J.J. Redick, SG Dalton Knecht &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>The coaching drama and Bronny James drama dominated the offseason &ndash; which may have been a good thing, in a way, because it obscured the fact that the Lakers&rsquo; roster hasn&rsquo;t changed much. The biggest addition will be rookie Dalton Knecht. At age 23, he should be further along than most rookies, but he&rsquo;d still project as an average NBA player in his first year (which is a compliment.)</p>

<p>The bigger improvement will have to come internally, with better rotations and a better shot diet. Last season, the Lakers finished in the bottom 3 in terms of three-point attempts. As an analytically-inclined sharpshooter himself, you&rsquo;d have to think J.J. Redick will make that a point of emphasis.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>If the Lakers are going to shoot more threes, Dalton Knecht will need to play, and <strong>Max Christie</strong> may have to as well. Christie came out of Michigan State before he was physically strong enough to handle major minutes, but his shot hasn&rsquo;t been a problem (hitting 37.8% in his career so far). Now that he&rsquo;s in Year 3, there&rsquo;s a good chance that the rest of his game has come together enough to start playing 25 minutes a night. If he can be a solid 3+D option, that would be a major boost for the team.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The Los Angeles Lakers are treading in dangerous territory here. Their &ldquo;upside&rdquo; is limited at around 48 wins or so, and there&rsquo;s sizable downside if one of their superstars (notably Anthony Davis) misses time. Things may need to go right for them to even make the playoffs. <strong>43-39</strong> feels like a safe bet accordingly.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>With an over/under at 43.5, this seems like a clear <strong>stay away</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(9) MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>27-55</strong>, -7.0 point differential, # 12 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 30th on offense, 12th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: It&rsquo;s hard to take much away from the &lsquo;23-24 season. Due to injuries and other issues, Ja Morant played a grand total of 9 games. Desmond Bane only played 42. If you wanted to gauge the team&rsquo;s true talent you may have to look to the 56-26 and 51-31 records from the prior two seasons.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;subtractions&rdquo;</em>: SG Luke Kennard (may re-sign soon)</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: C Zach Edey &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be easy to just jump back to the 50-win Memphis Grizzlies of the past, but that may be optimistic. Those teams had some solid veterans on the roster like Steven Adams and Tyus Jones. The current version may have to rely more on younger prospects like Santi Aldama (23 years old) and G.G. Jackson (still only 19!).</p>

<p>Of course, the biggest name and biggest body among them will be Zach Edey, the towering center from Purdue. He&rsquo;ll jump into a large role right away. In fact, he&rsquo;s the betting favorite for Rookie of the Year.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>Zach Edey will be a big boom/bust addition, but I&rsquo;d also throw in forgotten man <strong>Brandon Clarke</strong> into that equation. An energetic and athletic smallball big, Clarke showed a lot of defensive promise before he tore his Achilles in &lsquo;22. He <em>should</em> be ready for this season, and would theoretically provide a great yin-and-yang platoon with Edey down low. But if Clarke doesn&rsquo;t look the same, the Grizzlies&rsquo; frontcourt depth will be a question mark.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>Even if Ja Morant roars back to his old form, I&rsquo;m still a little worried about the offensive fits around him. In their best seasons, the Grizzlies were top 5 in terms of pace. It&rsquo;ll be harder to run and gun with Zach Edey; he&rsquo;s more mobile than you&rsquo;d think, but he&rsquo;s still a massive individual. In theory, you could run two versions of your offense &ndash; allowing Morant to run wild in transition but involve Edey heavily in the halfcourt sets. But until we see that work, it&rsquo;s a question mark. <strong>43-39</strong> may be a cautious prediction accordingly.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>Vegas is ready to pencil Memphis back into their old winning ways, listing them at an over/under of 47.5. While our prediction would claim that as a clear under, there&rsquo;s so much uncertainty here that I&rsquo;d rather <strong>stay away</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(10) NEW ORLEANS PELICANS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>49-33</strong>, +4.4 point differential, # 12 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 11th on offense, 7th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: In terms of advanced stats and point differential, the Pelicans projected as a 52-win team. Some of that may have been good fortune though, as their opponents shot only 34.9% from three, second lowest in the NBA. Part of that is due to good perimeter defense from Herb Jones and others, but part of that regresses according to historical trends. So all in all, their <strong>49</strong> wins was probably fair.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: C Jonas Valanciunas, SF Naji Marshall, PF Larry Nance Jr., SG Dyson Daniels</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: PG Dejounte Murray, C Daniel Theis, C Yves Missi &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Depending on what happens with Brandon Ingram, the biggest change on the roster will be the addition of Dejounte Murray. Murray didn&rsquo;t light the world on fire in Atlanta, but the Pelicans didn&rsquo;t have to pay as much in a trade as the Hawks did, so it represents a reasonable gamble here. Murray should be able to provide more juice in the backcourt than an aging C.J. McCollum can at this stage.</p>

<p>Speaking of juice, Pelicans fans should be savoring the season they got from Zion Williamson. Not only did he play 70 games, but he looked spry on both ends. He was more impactful and disruptive on defense than he had been in the past, including career highs in steals and blocks. At the same time, that career high in blocks still amounted to only 0.7 per game, which will bring in a question about the Pelicans&rsquo; ability to protect the rim. That&rsquo;s doubly true with the absence of true center Jonas Valanciunas.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>Presuming rookie Yves Missi isn&rsquo;t ready yet, the Pelicans are going to be a smallball team. If that&rsquo;s the case, they need to take advantage and jack up more threes than they did this past season when they ranked 24th in the NBA in 3PA.</p>

<p>Wing <strong>Trey Murphy III</strong> may be the key to that. Murphy had some injury issues that slowed his progress (and kept him at 29.6 minutes and 14.8 points per game), but he&rsquo;s an ace shooter who has the potential to average 20 PPG one day. Getting a healthy Murphy locked in will be vital to the grand plan &ndash; not of smallball, but the elusive &ldquo;medium ball&rdquo; where everyone is between 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; and 6&rsquo;8&rdquo;. With Murphy (6&rsquo;8&rdquo;), Herb Jones (6&rsquo;8&rdquo;), Brandon Ingram (6&rsquo;8&rdquo;) and Zion Williamson (6&rsquo;6&rdquo;), the Pelicans may be closer to that than any other team.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of Dejounte Murray; I think his stats and reputation got inflated by virtue of being a go-to player early on in San Antonio. Still, there&rsquo;s no denying the talent on this team. If Zion Williamson can play at least 60 games, then <strong>43-39</strong> is a realistic outcome. There&rsquo;s boom/bust potential from there, largely depending on his health. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised by anywhere from 40 to 50 wins.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The team is at 45.5 which again suggests the &ldquo;under,&rdquo; but the element of uncertainty here also makes us <strong>stay away</strong>.</p>

      <label for="lig066q" class="commentText"><p>For the Grizz: Last season was not measurable. It was just a lost season where we got to develop some of the younger role players. Lets look at the end of 22 as our gauge on what&rsquo;s happened since. We floundered in the playoffs, mainly due to center depth and injuries. We lost Adams and Clarke (our two best centers) and were forced to go with Tillman and Jaren playing C. Edey and Clarke being added to the mix improve where we were tremendously. Kennard is back. GG, Vince, Pippen, Aldama are young guys who have shown improvement. Marcus Smart was added as a defensive stopper. 2 offensive genius coaches were added to the staff in St. Andrews (a half court offense guy) and Iisalo who had the highest offensive rated team ever I believe (even counting NBA) over in Europe last year. Ja, Bane, and JJJJ at his natural roaming PF spot is a proven recipe for success. They have no evidence of being not a top seed when they all play. Bane was averaging potential All-NBA stats last year before going down with injury. JJJ will be back to DPoY form with a behmoth in Edey doing all the dirty center work. Ja has to have a bigger chip on his shoulder than any player in the league. If we start Ja, Bane, Vince, JJJ, Edey that&rsquo;s an All NBA player, a top 5 SG, a great 3 and D connective guy, DPoY, and a 2-time NCAA player of the year. Then on the bench you got the most accurate shooter in the league, a DPoY, a great transition big man in Clarke, a potential microwave guy in GG Jackson, the best current Spanish player in the league, 2 sharpshooter rookies in Wells and pyscho Cam Spencer, a should be SL MVP in Pippen, and others. This team has a big 3, solid young high motor depth, chemistry, an incredible coaching staff, and proven success in the regular season. Just imagine the starters coming off the floor and then you have to go up against a guard duo of Pippen and Smart hounding you. We are gonna be a great rebounding team, a top transition offense, and top turnover generator. Ja with Vince and Clarke in transition is gonna run older guys off the court.</p>
