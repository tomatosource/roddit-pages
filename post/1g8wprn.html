<p>Joe Mazzulla: “Zero. No pressure. We’re all going to be dead soon, and it really doesn’t matter anymore.</p>

<p>“So, zero pressure. You’re either going to win or you’re not. … It’s not pressure. It’s an opportunity.”</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Full quote:</p>

<p><strong>Zero. No pressure. We’re all going to be dead soon, and it really doesn’t matter anymore</strong>. So, zero pressure. You’re either going to win or you’re not. And <strong>when you win, you try to forget about it a week later, and when you lose, you try to forget about it a week later.</strong> It’s not pressure. It’s an opportunity. We have an opportunity here for the next few years, however long we’re together — I’ve said this in the past — we have an opportunity to carry the organization forward, to double down on the tradition and the history of what this organization has.</p>

<p>And what else would you expect than somebody expecting you to win all the time? I wouldn’t want someone expecting me to lose all the time. That would be debilitating. So we have an expectation to win. We have great character, great talent, and we just have to work to maximize that and try to rely on the players to do that</p>

<p>I just don’t look at it as pressure. <strong>A Boston media member or somebody expecting me to win, they don’t have a weapon. They’re not going to come after me if I don’t win.</strong> It’s just people saying words, and they don’t mean anything. They’re just words. You’re just saying them because you have to say them. <strong>You’re contractually obligated to write a 500-word article afterward. They’re just words. You can’t do anything.</strong></p>

<p>So it’s just a made-up word. We don’t have a pressure. <strong>If we lose, we’re not losing our life. We’re not surgeons. We’re not in the military. We coach basketball for a living</strong>. No one’s putting more pressure and ‘expectations’ than we are on ourselves. We have a responsibility. … I ask guys all the time: <strong>Would you rather have someone expect you to lose or win?</strong></p>

<p>If you came up here and were like, ‘Man, I really expected you to lose that game,’ I would be pissed. But if you come up here and are like, ‘You should have won that game,’ it’s like, yeah, that’s what we signed up for. So I think it’s just the perspective of how you look at it and the truth of it.</p>

<p>If you allow words to take your personal power, then yes. So I don’t allow words to take my personal power. That’s just important. Words don’t have — they only have power if you allow them to. <strong>That’s what I try to teach my kids, like, I don’t give a shit what someone says to me. Did you allow that to have an impact on you?</strong> He didn’t put his hands on you, he didn’t touch you, he didn’t do anything. He said something to you. So now you have a choice to decide how you’re going to interpret that.</p>

<p>So, it’s not pressure. There’s nothing anyone in this (press conference) circle can do to me that’s going to impact my identity and who I am as a person and a coach. <strong>We’re either going to win or we’re not, and 40 years from now, none of you are invited to my funeral, and that’s it. That’s it.</strong></p>

      <label for="lt1v7ha" class="commentText"><p>Or 3. Guys that realize that life IS in fact too short to not try to do what you want.</p>

<p>We pay mortgages or have plans for the future, which is good and responsible btw, but we also have these “I’ll go on vacation when I…”, “maybe I’ll go see the broadway show next year”, “I’ll talk to her/him/they, when I have more money or when I’m ready” or “I’ll start working out when..”thoughts, but the reality is that life is too random for us not to do the stuff we like.</p>

<p>We genuinely don’t know when we’re about to die, we can minimize our chances of it, but like when we get in a car or a plane, or on a train, or any situation, there’s never a 100% chance of survival.</p>

<p>We need balance, yeah it’s inconvenient to travel but why not (if it’s not that much of a financial hit or whatever just do it), sure I could’ve waited but I did it and I’m not regretting it. Personally that’s how I think, I’m not imposing that mentality on others.</p>

      <label for="lt2cin0" class="commentText"><p>Number 1 is basically describing optimistic nihilism. <strong>The realization that the lack of meaning in the world and the universe as a whole can be liberating. Precisely because there is no inherited meaning in life. There is no cosmic plan forcing you to act a certain way. We are the ones who can create our own path.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m one of those people that thinks existence IS inherently meaningless but honestly that makes existence incredible. By sheer luck I get to experience being self aware.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bunch of atoms that have configured themselves in a manner that allows me to realize that I am indeed made up of atoms.  I <em>(well people way smarter than me)</em> figured out how these atoms behave under a large amount of cicumstances and while he haven&rsquo;t figured out how to unify quantum mechanics and gravity, we still know a whole lot and have a pretty good picture of how things operate on a day to day basis in our physical world. I&rsquo;m typing a message on a keyboard that is being sent out and potentially read by thousands of other beings just like me.  We&rsquo;re hairless apes on a mostly water covered rock, moving like 30km per second around a nuclear reactor that is so massive you cannot possibly comprehend it&rsquo;s size and we&rsquo;re acutely aware of it and a lot of other things.</p>

<p>We have this weird consciousness that we can&rsquo;t really fully explain but we experience it every day along with billions of others.  Yes, I&rsquo;m going to die along with everyone else but for a brief moment in the grand time scale of the universe, we are the universe made aware of itself.  To me that is honestly incredible.</p>

<p>Pressure? Nah, this is just playing ball. Pressure is the homeless man, who doesn&rsquo;t know where his next meal is coming from. Pressure is the single mom, who is trying to scuffle and pay her rent. We get paid a lot of money to play a game. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - there are challenges. But to call it pressure is almost an insult to regular people.</p>

His dad destroyed him, mostly through wrestling moves if I recall. Zach kept asking “why did he fight you? Was he joking, did you do something wrong” and Joe kept laughing and saying it was probably because Joe was acting too confident. He didn’t remember doing anything wrong, but he said his dad put him in his place and it is one of the most important moments of his life</p>

      <label for="lt1nk0i" class="commentText"><p>Usually with defending champs it&rsquo;s not about pressure, but keeping that same level of hunger to win it all.  There&rsquo;s also the disease of more that Pat Riley talks about.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;d say motivation and stamina are the biggest hurdles to repeating for defending champs that keep their core team together, not pressure.</p>

      <label for="lt1qph8" class="commentText"><p>Luckily for Joe, his top two guys have plenty of motivation, Tatum with his disasterous Olympics and Jaylen for not being invited in the first place. Not to mention that they returned literally everyone in their top 13 of the roster from last year outside of Brissett so no questions of  chemistry. Probably easier than most defending teams to maintain that hunger.</p>

<p>Man am I glad I was wrong. This guy is insane and hilarious. Like, seriously. What is wrong with him lol? He’s a quote machine. He reminds me of Jim Harbaugh.</p>

<p>He says pressure is really an opportunity, and that is a unique and positive way to reframe it.</p>
