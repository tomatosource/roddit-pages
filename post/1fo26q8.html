      <p>In this awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N71Pv48erIc&amp;t=275s" target="_blank">Ahmad Rashad interview</a> with Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell, Rashad asks the two legends to pick their top 5 (at 6:36 mark, but watch the whole thing), with the caveat that they can&rsquo;t pick themselves or each other.</p>

<p>Wilt: Names Larry Bird unequivocally first. Then adds West, Baylor, Oscar before adding Magic/Jordan (&ldquo;gimme six&rdquo;). Then asks if he can have a 7th, Charles Barkley!</p>

<p>Russell: Magic, Jordan, Bird, Baylor, and Oscar for his 5, along with Olajuwon and Pettit.</p>

<p>Kareem doesn&rsquo;t make either list! Neither did Dr. J.</p>

<p>Kareem being a unanimous top guy is kinda something that&rsquo;s really gained steam just over the last 10-15 years. He used to have a lot of critics who wouldn&rsquo;t put him up there (Wilt being one of his loudest critics). Even his all-time points record was brushed off as &ldquo;yeah, that&rsquo;s just because he played forever. He wasn&rsquo;t actually the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recall even when he was still playing - and even before 2014 - he was being touted as the greatest PF of all time.  Has his stock really risen all that much since then?</p>

      <label for="lon43jb" class="commentText"><p>I give this explanation every time the subject comes up, but I will again; A lot of the story about why Kareem didn&rsquo;t come up until the last decade or so in discussions of GOAT lists has a ton to do with his poor relationship with both his fellow players, and the media. Dude was very prickly and shy for a lot of his time, and it rubbed people the wrong way.</p>

<p>His dominance of the 70s kind of gets overlooked because the media and others in the basketball landscape were seeking someone more charismatic and approachable to take the mantle from him. Wilt suffered from this same situation in his career too (in that he rubbed a lot of people the wrong way) but he had charisma and was anything but shy, so it didn&rsquo;t hurt his legacy as much as I feel it hurt Kareem&rsquo;s (Wilt is still criminally underrated by today&rsquo;s fans tho too)</p>

      <label for="looq9z7" class="commentText"><p>If I am taking a career I am taking lebron. If I am taking one game (or really any peak of X years) vs the monstars - it’s Jordan.</p>

<p>Something that hurts lebron is that when you take his career you also have to look at how he bounced around teams - playing with superstars, destroying the team in return for a ring.</p>

      <label for="loor46a" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s really interesting. It just goes to show what so many of us [somewhat] older folks have been saying for years: that Kareem was nowhere near the goat debate until the last 10-15 years.</p>

<p>Back in the day, it was always Russell-Wilt, then it became Bird-Magic, then Jordan. And since Lebron&rsquo;s deserved rise, KAJ has somehow injected himself into the top 3, while Wilt has fallen out of some people&rsquo;s top 10.</p>

<p>Not that these two guys are the be all-end all, but it does go to show that these lists aren&rsquo;t static</p>
