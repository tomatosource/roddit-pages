      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e4tjsc/holmes_nate_robinson_says_he_has_trouble_getting/"><p>[Holmes] Nate Robinson says he has trouble getting on a kidney donor waiting list because is blood pressure has remained too high and because he kept getting too ill too often. He&rsquo;s said there are so many people who are more deserving</p>
</a>
    </h2>

      <blockquote>
<p>He isn&rsquo;t on a donor waiting list. He said he&rsquo;s had trouble getting on one because his blood pressure has remained too high and because he kept getting too ill too often. He&rsquo;s said there are so many people who are more deserving, including others who have been on dialysis for much longer. He has also expressed confusion about the whole process, repeatedly saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, man. I&rsquo;m not a doctor. Don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About a week later, it arrived. Robinson was driving through Seattle when he received word from a friend who had been in touch with UW. The school had been inundated with offers from people willing to donate their kidneys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thousands,&rdquo; Robinson said.</p>

      <label for="ldh8iqj" class="commentText"><p>This story seems weird given my own family member&rsquo;s journey. I know health, age, and other outcome focused factors are supposed to be considered, but I had a 2nd cousin (mom&rsquo;s cousin, so older) who got kidneys and liver in the past year. Given his health before the organ failure and RAPID decline once it was diagnosed, i was very surprised when they found him a match and he went in for the transplants. Nate bring kept off the donor lists, by comparison, just blows my mind.</p>

<p>Hope his situation improves and he gets the donation he needs.</p>
