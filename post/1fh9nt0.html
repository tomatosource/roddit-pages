</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <ol>
<li>LeBron James: The ultimate package, he was able to carry teams with either mediocre shooting, above average, or slightly below average shooting (I&rsquo;m saying this without looking at his team stats, just my eye test), no matter what he did was able to make a top offense. His finishing could generate playoff offenses&rsquo; by itself minus his all-time playmaking. All of this with his elite help side defense, makes him GOAT status.</li>
<li>Stephen Curry: Best regular season I&rsquo;ve witnessed, was able to create a play out of thin air. Could&rsquo;ve dribbled the air out of the ball, rather have made a few sharp dribbles broke the defense with his threat of shooting, and create something for his teammates. Pair this with his hyper efficient finishing, make him a headache for defenses. Then you realize you have best shooter to have ever lived (no matter the range). And you realize you have the best offensive threat that has ever lived.</li>
<li>Nikola Jokic: The ultimate offensive player, could score efficiently no matter where, mid range, the paint, or at the basket. His passing angles and accuracy will probably be unmatched for the rest of my life. His play recognition for cutters is undefeated, maybe the most complete offensive player I watched.  Only held back by his defensive weakness that has hindered his teams at spots.</li>
<li>Kevin Durant: The ultimate scorer, never seen a man be able to score as efficiently as him in my life, saw him score 48 and the game winner live and basically expected as much (Thunder @ Wolves 2014), was a underrated help defender that could make plays defensively. The ideal basketball player.</li>
<li>Kawhi Leonard: Maybe the best playoff run I&rsquo;ve witnessed. No matter what he did, it was a positive. In terms of just scoring and defending he was the best I&rsquo;ve seen, bar none. He could get to spots at will with minimal effort, and keep your best perimeter threat in check. Could&rsquo;ve ranked higher if not for the all of his missed seasons.</li>
</ol>

<p>Honorable Mentions: Luka Doncic, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard.</p>
