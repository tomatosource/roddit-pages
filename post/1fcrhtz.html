      <label for="lmb7mxg" class="commentText"><p>No, they help the Warriors by not blowing the whistle on screens and defense. There was a ton of physicality in that game and from like 4:00 in the 3rd to 10:00 in the 4th, the Warriors overcame their 10 point deficit off transition opportunities that were created off arguable fouls that weren&rsquo;t called. Rockets were attacking the paint and getting hammered without getting the call, so they switched to chucking 3s, which was a big contributor to the 0-27.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s kinda how the refs call the playoffs though. Warriors got boned by the refs and Cavs during their first 2 series cuz of the physicality. Getting West and Zaza really helped balance that and of course KD put them over the top.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how long the foul lasts. The only relevant part is when the foul started.</p>

<p>In this case, the contact starts before Harden gathers.</p>

      <label for="lmawjvr" class="commentText"><p>That was also on Mike D&rsquo;Antoni though.  When all you do all year long is talk about / execute that all you&rsquo;re going to do is shoot threes or get layups, of course teams are going to sell out on both of those things in the playoffs in a tight game.</p>

<p>In a tight playoff game, sometimes you just need a fucking bucket.  Since they were overplaying the three ball so much, it would have been very easy to get nearly wide open midrange jumpers.  Because of MAD&rsquo;s refusal to stray away from his system in these important moments, it bit them in the ass when the threes started not falling and the refs started giving them unfavorable calls.</p>

<p>This has always been MAD&rsquo;s problem though and it&rsquo;s why nobody wants him as a HC these days.  He&rsquo;ll create this new offense strategy that completely revolutionizes how the game is played, but he falls too in love with it and won&rsquo;t stray for any reason, even when it&rsquo;s blatantly obvious that adjustments need to be made.</p>

<p>its rich seeing any team that had that version of james harden on it complain about the refs. refs favored harden all year, including that series.</p>

<p>bottom line is, the rockets missed 27 threes in a row, and they lost. having james harden on your team and complaining about refs is absolutely hilarious, the guy legitimately has made more free throws than field goals in his career</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s honestly gross that&rsquo;s even a foul. Classic Harden baiting. That play is essentially a &ldquo;rip through&rdquo; foul, there&rsquo;s a hand on his chest for a split second and Harden throws up a prayer that he has no intention of going in (this one happens to disgustingly bank in) just in hope of being bailed out with a foul.</p>

      <label for="lmbd182" class="commentText"><p>This is really rich coming from a Cavs fan. The refs and league helped your team extend the series more than anyone other than the Lakers. The only reason your team picked up finals wins at all instead of getting swept was because of insane ref treatment. The calls were so one sided to try to extend the series for TV dollars, you should know better. The Cavs broke an NBA record because of how aggressively one-sided the calls were in 2016.</p>

      <label for="lmap5og" class="commentText"><p>Yea friendly reminder that Chris Paul was injured. Not to over simplify but if the Rockets win, it&rsquo;s Harden and role players versus Lebron and role players/Kevin Love. I&rsquo;m not saying for sure the Cavs win but Lebron was going nuclear that playoffs run.</p>

<p>The Cavs chance versus the Warriors that year was like 1%, Rockets win that game I think the Cavs have like a 55% chance. Obviously we&rsquo;ll never know, I wouldn&rsquo;t argue if someone said the Rockets would win so long as they acknowledge Cavs would have a chance.</p>

Went to 7 against oladipo led pacers team. Then went to 7 against a rookie led Tatum Boston team missing two max players on their roster. The rockets would have destroyed them Chris Paul or no?

<p>From that point people have never stopped shutting up about oMg choker despite the 2015 trip to the WCF being a miracle run and carry job, and them having no chance against the Spurs in 2017 - it wasn&rsquo;t even supposed to go 6, but Harden never gets credit when he takes teams further than they&rsquo;re meant to go.</p>

<p>The Rockets were projected to be a First Round washout that year cause Harden was a disappointment, but at the same time, losing to the Spurs in the Second Round meant that Harden was a scrub. Only one of them can be true. You can&rsquo;t be both strong and weak at the same time.</p>

Going 2-11 for 10 pts and losing by 39 in a close-out game at home where the opposing team doesn’t even have their best player is going to do a lot of damage to a player’s playoff reputation, regardless of who that player is.</p>

If this was the NFL, he&rsquo;d probably be taken aside for concussion protocols and he certainly played like he had one after that point. (Also, if you&rsquo;re getting blown out by 39, it&rsquo;s rarely one player&rsquo;s fault. The whole team&rsquo;s fucking up if you&rsquo;re losing by that much.)</p>

<p>Harden is extremely secretive and never talks about injuries, so it&rsquo;ll never come from him, but rumors are that he wasn&rsquo;t right after the elbow for a while.</p>

<p>Move the 2018 Rockets to 2020, 2021, or 2022 and they win a chip easily. Hell, even move them to 2019 instead of their owner wanting to cut all their depth to dodge the tax and CP3 being horrible in the series vs the Warriors.</p>

<p>Or, if CP3s hamstring doesn&rsquo;t blow up in 2018 they also win.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;worst&rdquo; playoff moments come from like 2 games in 2015 and 2 in 2017, but 2015 was a miracle run to even get to the WCF and he dragged that team to like 10 wins higher than expected only for PABLO PRIGONI to be suiting up against the fucking Warriors in the WCF, and 2017 that Rockets team had worse finals odds than the Pistons, Hornets, etc at like +16,000 odds (that&rsquo;s REALLY BAD btw) and they lost to a team with top 4 title odds that season and were a 60 win team.</p>

<p>The Rockets had to start a 37 year old Jason Terry in the playoffs that year. That&rsquo;s how bad the Rockets injury issues were. And Josh Smith was frequently the Rockets 2nd best player in the playoffs. That&rsquo;s how bad Dwight Howard&rsquo;s decline from age and injuries were.</p>

<p>And Harden showed up against a 67 Win Golden State Warriors in the WCF. 28/8/6 shooting 43% from 3 with a TS% of 62.7% and made it competitive despite having to start a 37 year old Jason Terry against a 26 year old Steph Curry entering his prime. Never gets credit for that somehow.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to have watched the 94 and 95 runs in person, and I can say that 2015 and 2018 were some of the nuttiest, funnest playoff runs I&rsquo;ve seen for the Rockets and people should lay off the salt and actually try to have an enjoyable time watching basketball. Those years came up short, but there&rsquo;s a lot to appreciate about them.</p>

      <label for="lmag9h2" class="commentText"><p>You need to work on your reading comprehension. He’s not saying he’s top 15 all time. He’s saying that if he had some lucky breaks which resulted in more accolades, that he could potentially be considered top 15.</p>

<p>The point is that Harden had some pretty unlucky breaks in his career. His peak coincided with the KD Warriors making winning a ring very difficult, the CP3 hammy injury prevented a potential championship, he could’ve won again in 2021 with the Nets if him and Kyrie are healthy, and he was top 2 in MVP four times in his career but only has 1 MVP to show for it. There’s an alternate universe where the dude has 3 MVPs and a couple rings at this point in his career if a couple of injuries and narratives break differently.</p>

<p>Yes, some of the playoff failures are his own fault, but other runs were stopped due to unfortunate injuries.</p>

      <label for="lmawgvo" class="commentText"><p>Better yet, the Rockets had, at one point, the 2nd longest winning streak in NBA history during the 2007-2008 season when they won 22 in a row.</p>

<p>This is more impressive because this Rockets team was injury-plagued, especially with their stars T-Mac and Yao (they had games where they didn&rsquo;t play, Yao moreso than T-Mac), so they went on that winning streak through the contributions of Aaron Brooks, Shane Battier, Dikembe Mutombo, Carl Landry, Bobby Jackson, Luis Scola, and more.</p>

<p>Basically the entire team had to contribute to get the streak going, and they did.</p>
