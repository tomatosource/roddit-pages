<p>its rich seeing any team that had that version of james harden on it complain about the refs. refs favored harden all year, including that series.</p>

<p>bottom line is, the rockets missed 27 threes in a row, and they lost. having james harden on your team and complaining about refs is absolutely hilarious, the guy legitimately has made more free throws than field goals in his career</p>

Not to over simplify but if the Rockets win, it&rsquo;s Harden and role players versus Lebron and role players/Kevin Love. I&rsquo;m not saying for sure the Cavs win but Lebron was going nuclear that playoffs run.</p>

<p>The Cavs chance versus the Warriors that year was like 1%, Rockets win that game I think the Cavs have like a 55% chance. Obviously we&rsquo;ll never know, I wouldn&rsquo;t argue if someone said the Rockets would win so long as they acknowledge Cavs would have a chance.</p>

<p>From that point people have never stopped shutting up about oMg choker despite the 2015 trip to the WCF being a miracle run and carry job, and them having no chance against the Spurs in 2017 - it wasn&rsquo;t even supposed to go 6, but Harden never gets credit when he takes teams further than they&rsquo;re meant to go.</p>

<p>The Rockets were projected to be a First Round washout that year cause Harden was a disappointment, but at the same time, losing to the Spurs in the Second Round meant that Harden was a scrub. Only one of them can be true. You can&rsquo;t be both strong and weak at the same time.</p>

Going 2-11 for 10 pts and losing by 39 in a close-out game at home where the opposing team doesn’t even have their best player is going to do a lot of damage to a player’s playoff reputation, regardless of who that player is.</p>

      <label for="lmaor0f" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m also giving Harden a little leeway considering towards the end of Game 5, he took an elbow to the head and wiped out on the court. If this was the NFL, he&rsquo;d probably be taken aside for concussion protocols and he certainly played like he had one after that point. (Also, if you&rsquo;re getting blown out by 39, it&rsquo;s rarely one player&rsquo;s fault. The whole team&rsquo;s fucking up if you&rsquo;re losing by that much.)</p>

<p>Harden is extremely secretive and never talks about injuries, so it&rsquo;ll never come from him, but rumors are that he wasn&rsquo;t right after the elbow for a while.</p>

<p>Move the 2018 Rockets to 2020, 2021, or 2022 and they win a chip easily. Hell, even move them to 2019 instead of their owner wanting to cut all their depth to dodge the tax and CP3 being horrible in the series vs the Warriors.</p>

<p>Or, if CP3s hamstring doesn&rsquo;t blow up in 2018 they also win.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;worst&rdquo; playoff moments come from like 2 games in 2015 and 2 in 2017, but 2015 was a miracle run to even get to the WCF and he dragged that team to like 10 wins higher than expected only for PABLO PRIGONI to be suiting up against the fucking Warriors in the WCF, and 2017 that Rockets team had worse finals odds than the Pistons, Hornets, etc at like +16,000 odds (that&rsquo;s REALLY BAD btw) and they lost to a team with top 4 title odds that season and were a 60 win team.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Rockets had to start a 37 year old Jason Terry in the playoffs that year. That&rsquo;s how bad the Rockets injury issues were. And Josh Smith was frequently the Rockets 2nd best player in the playoffs. That&rsquo;s how bad Dwight Howard&rsquo;s decline from age and injuries were.</p>

<p>And Harden showed up against a 67 Win Golden State Warriors in the WCF. 28/8/6 shooting 43% from 3 with a TS% of 62.7% and made it competitive despite having to start a 37 year old Jason Terry against a 26 year old Steph Curry entering his prime. Never gets credit for that somehow.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to have watched the 94 and 95 runs in person, and I can say that 2015 and 2018 were some of the nuttiest, funnest playoff runs I&rsquo;ve seen for the Rockets and people should lay off the salt and actually try to have an enjoyable time watching basketball. Those years came up short, but there&rsquo;s a lot to appreciate about them.</p>

      <label for="lmag9h2" class="commentText"><p>You need to work on your reading comprehension. He’s not saying he’s top 15 all time. He’s saying that if he had some lucky breaks which resulted in more accolades, that he could potentially be considered top 15.</p>

<p>The point is that Harden had some pretty unlucky breaks in his career. His peak coincided with the KD Warriors making winning a ring very difficult, the CP3 hammy injury prevented a potential championship, he could’ve won again in 2021 with the Nets if him and Kyrie are healthy, and he was top 2 in MVP four times in his career but only has 1 MVP to show for it. There’s an alternate universe where the dude has 3 MVPs and a couple rings at this point in his career if a couple of injuries and narratives break differently.</p>

<p>Yes, some of the playoff failures are his own fault, but other runs were stopped due to unfortunate injuries.</p>

<p>If you moved Harden&rsquo;s Rockets to today&rsquo;s era of parity, they probably win 2-3 rings in between 2020 and 2024.</p>
