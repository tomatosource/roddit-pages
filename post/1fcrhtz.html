      <label for="lmbozjt" class="commentText"><p>I have to disagree because Klay&rsquo;s hand on Harden&rsquo;s chest is not in and of itself a foul unless he uses it to actively impede Harden&rsquo;s movement. A foul does not occur until Harden enters his shooting motion and Klay&rsquo;s arm is draped over Harden&rsquo;s. This isn&rsquo;t even a rip through move. The only foul is Klay impeding Harden&rsquo;s shooting motion.</p>

      <label for="lmb7mxg" class="commentText"><p>No, they help the Warriors by not blowing the whistle on screens and defense. There was a ton of physicality in that game and from like 4:00 in the 3rd to 10:00 in the 4th, the Warriors overcame their 10 point deficit off transition opportunities that were created off arguable fouls that weren&rsquo;t called. Rockets were attacking the paint and getting hammered without getting the call, so they switched to chucking 3s, which was a big contributor to the 0-27.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s kinda how the refs call the playoffs though. Warriors got boned by the refs and Cavs during their first 2 series cuz of the physicality. Getting West and Zaza really helped balance that and of course KD put them over the top.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how long the foul lasts. The only relevant part is when the foul started.</p>

<p>In this case, the contact starts before Harden gathers.</p>

      <label for="lmbtdn4" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t really think there was much the Rockets could do &ldquo;versatility&rdquo; wise. With CP3 gone there really wasn&rsquo;t another ball-handler besides maybe Gordon. Even then the talent disparity those last 2 games was absurd the Rockets were going to need to be on one to pull it off.</p>

<p>You have 4 HOF&rsquo;ers + Iggy going against Harden, Gordon, Ariza, Capela and Tucker. 3 of those guys can&rsquo;t even dribble and no one can post up so there&rsquo;s not really a whole lot you can do offensively besides just run it all through Harden. The only bench piece worth a damn since Mbah a Moute was hurt was Gerald Green.</p>

      <label for="lmawjvr" class="commentText"><p>That was also on Mike D&rsquo;Antoni though.  When all you do all year long is talk about / execute that all you&rsquo;re going to do is shoot threes or get layups, of course teams are going to sell out on both of those things in the playoffs in a tight game.</p>

<p>In a tight playoff game, sometimes you just need a fucking bucket.  Since they were overplaying the three ball so much, it would have been very easy to get nearly wide open midrange jumpers.  Because of MAD&rsquo;s refusal to stray away from his system in these important moments, it bit them in the ass when the threes started not falling and the refs started giving them unfavorable calls.</p>

<p>This has always been MAD&rsquo;s problem though and it&rsquo;s why nobody wants him as a HC these days.  He&rsquo;ll create this new offense strategy that completely revolutionizes how the game is played, but he falls too in love with it and won&rsquo;t stray for any reason, even when it&rsquo;s blatantly obvious that adjustments need to be made.</p>

<p>The Nets had one amazing season with their big 3 and it was the season Mike was basically helping Nash coach.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s had plenty of opportunities to win rings and in 2018 he and the Rockets did ultimately get screwed. Not to mention even if you don&rsquo;t think they got screwed the fact they were missing their second best player by a massive margin in Paul was a big thing.</p>

      <label for="lmbd182" class="commentText"><p>This is really rich coming from a Cavs fan. The refs and league helped your team extend the series more than anyone other than the Lakers. The only reason your team picked up finals wins at all instead of getting swept was because of insane ref treatment. The calls were so one sided to try to extend the series for TV dollars, you should know better. The Cavs broke an NBA record because of how aggressively one-sided the calls were in 2017.</p>

<p>Game 3 of the 2017 Finals was the single worst officiated game I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my entire NBA fandom. Yes I&rsquo;m still salty the refs ruined the 16-0 playoff run.</p>

<p>its rich seeing any team that had that version of james harden on it complain about the refs. refs favored harden all year, including that series.</p>

<p>bottom line is, the rockets missed 27 threes in a row, and they lost. having james harden on your team and complaining about refs is absolutely hilarious, the guy legitimately has made more free throws than field goals in his career</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s honestly gross that&rsquo;s even a foul. Classic Harden baiting. That play is essentially a &ldquo;rip through&rdquo; foul, there&rsquo;s a hand on his chest for a split second and Harden throws up a prayer that he has no intention of going in (this one happens to disgustingly bank in) just in hope of being bailed out with a foul.</p>

<p>Nobody who likes basketball wants that trash being rewarded</p>

<p>I agree the top end wing defense of the Warriors is better but the Rockets whole defensive identity was switching all because they felt confident with their guys. If you are talking about which team is easier to &ldquo;hunt a guy&rdquo; it was always the Warriors.</p>

<p>The Rocket&rsquo;s defense was still good, but it wasn&rsquo;t optimized to stop LeBron like the Warriors or Celtics were.</p>

      <label for="lmap5og" class="commentText"><p>Yea friendly reminder that Chris Paul was injured. Not to over simplify but if the Rockets win, it&rsquo;s Harden and role players versus Lebron and role players/Kevin Love. I&rsquo;m not saying for sure the Cavs win but Lebron was going nuclear that playoffs run.</p>

<p>The Cavs chance versus the Warriors that year was like 1%, Rockets win that game I think the Cavs have like a 55% chance. Obviously we&rsquo;ll never know, I wouldn&rsquo;t argue if someone said the Rockets would win so long as they acknowledge Cavs would have a chance.</p>

Went to 7 against oladipo led pacers team. Then went to 7 against a rookie led Tatum Boston team missing two max players on their roster. The rockets would have destroyed them Chris Paul or no?

      <label for="lmbjf14" class="commentText"><p>Yes they had trouble getting there but they swept the Raptors and Lebron basically won game 1 against the Warriors by himself. That&rsquo;s 51/8/8 on elite efficiency. Then if you remember he broke his hand after the game throwing a temper tantrum.</p>

<p>If he plays the Rockets, he&rsquo;s the best player on the court almost every single minute(he played almost every minute) and then you&rsquo;re comparing Kevin Love to Clint Capela? Eric Gordon to JR Smith? Yes, Harden is great. Yes, the Rockets were the 1 seed in the West. When you&rsquo;ve lost your second best player and you&rsquo;re playing the best player in the world at that point, I feel the odds have to swing a bit.</p>

<p>Also, the Rockets lost CP3 and then lost 2 games. Without him the team didn&rsquo;t work. With CP3 in the playoffs they&rsquo;re what, 11-4? To act like losing their second best player to go on and play the third best team, and imply the Cavs wouldn&rsquo;t have a decent shot is wild.</p>

<p>I think 55% is fair, if you think the Rockets would have a slight edge fine. But it&rsquo;s 40-55% I think. It would have been a great Finals, better than what we actually got(barring game 1).</p>

<p>From that point people have never stopped shutting up about oMg choker despite the 2015 trip to the WCF being a miracle run and carry job, and them having no chance against the Spurs in 2017 - it wasn&rsquo;t even supposed to go 6, but Harden never gets credit when he takes teams further than they&rsquo;re meant to go.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Rockets were projected to be a First Round washout that year cause Harden was a disappointment, but at the same time, losing to the Spurs in the Second Round meant that Harden was a scrub. Only one of them can be true. You can&rsquo;t be both strong and weak at the same time.</p>

Going 2-11 for 10 pts and losing by 39 in a close-out game at home where the opposing team doesn’t even have their best player is going to do a lot of damage to a player’s playoff reputation, regardless of who that player is.</p>

      <label for="lmaor0f" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m also giving Harden a little leeway considering towards the end of Game 5, he took an elbow to the head and wiped out on the court. If this was the NFL, he&rsquo;d probably be taken aside for concussion protocols and he certainly played like he had one after that point. (Also, if you&rsquo;re getting blown out by 39, it&rsquo;s rarely one player&rsquo;s fault. The whole team&rsquo;s fucking up if you&rsquo;re losing by that much.)</p>

<p>Harden is extremely secretive and never talks about injuries, so it&rsquo;ll never come from him, but rumors are that he wasn&rsquo;t right after the elbow for a while.</p>

<p>Move the 2018 Rockets to 2020, 2021, or 2022 and they win a chip easily. Hell, even move them to 2019 instead of their owner wanting to cut all their depth to dodge the tax and CP3 being horrible in the series vs the Warriors.</p>

<p>Or, if CP3s hamstring doesn&rsquo;t blow up in 2018 they also win.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;worst&rdquo; playoff moments come from like 2 games in 2015 and 2 in 2017, but 2015 was a miracle run to even get to the WCF and he dragged that team to like 10 wins higher than expected only for PABLO PRIGONI to be suiting up against the fucking Warriors in the WCF, and 2017 that Rockets team had worse finals odds than the Pistons, Hornets, etc at like +16,000 odds (that&rsquo;s REALLY BAD btw) and they lost to a team with top 4 title odds that season and were a 60 win team.</p>

<p>The Rockets had to start a 37 year old Jason Terry in the playoffs that year. That&rsquo;s how bad the Rockets injury issues were. And Josh Smith was frequently the Rockets 2nd best player in the playoffs. That&rsquo;s how bad Dwight Howard&rsquo;s decline from age and injuries were.</p>

<p>And Harden showed up against a 67 Win Golden State Warriors in the WCF. 28/8/6 shooting 43% from 3 with a TS% of 62.7% and made it competitive despite having to start a 37 year old Jason Terry against a 26 year old Steph Curry entering his prime. Never gets credit for that somehow.</p>

      <label for="lmaknr5" class="commentText"><p>Instead of having a good time about Josh Smith starting to play like his NBA 2K version in real life, Jason Terry discovering the fountain of youth for 1 game, and Corey Brewer playing like a crackhead version of Steph Curry, the weirdo&rsquo;s of this subreddit always have to make it into a Harden hatefest.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to have watched the 94 and 95 runs in person, and I can say that 2015 and 2018 were some of the nuttiest, funnest playoff runs I&rsquo;ve seen for the Rockets and people should lay off the salt and actually try to have an enjoyable time watching basketball. Those years came up short, but there&rsquo;s a lot to appreciate about them.</p>

      <label for="lmag9h2" class="commentText"><p>You need to work on your reading comprehension. He’s not saying he’s top 15 all time. He’s saying that if he had some lucky breaks which resulted in more accolades, that he could potentially be considered top 15.</p>

<p>The point is that Harden had some pretty unlucky breaks in his career. His peak coincided with the KD Warriors making winning a ring very difficult, the CP3 hammy injury prevented a potential championship, he could’ve won again in 2021 with the Nets if him and Kyrie are healthy, and he was top 2 in MVP four times in his career but only has 1 MVP to show for it. There’s an alternate universe where the dude has 3 MVPs and a couple rings at this point in his career if a couple of injuries and narratives break differently.</p>

<p>Yes, some of the playoff failures are his own fault, but other runs were stopped due to unfortunate injuries.</p>

<p>This is more impressive because this Rockets team was injury-plagued, especially with their stars T-Mac and Yao (they had games where they didn&rsquo;t play, Yao moreso than T-Mac), so they went on that winning streak through the contributions of Aaron Brooks, Shane Battier, Dikembe Mutombo, Carl Landry, Bobby Jackson, Luis Scola, and more.</p>

<p>Basically the entire team had to contribute to get the streak going, and they did.</p>

It&rsquo;s all about getting shots up quickly and the post season game tends to slow down and into the half court set. Even the Warriors lost in 2016 because they couldn&rsquo;t score in the half court.</p>

      <label for="lmbk95z" class="commentText"><p>What everyone forgets about that season is that the Warriors were SO dominant, solid teams didn’t even go for it because they knew they couldn’t contend. The parity in the league was nothing like it is not. There were 10-12 BAD teams. Now, there are maybe 3-4 each year</p>

      <label for="lmby3hl" class="commentText"><p>I think you&rsquo;re missing the most impressive stat which is that Miami team went 27-0. To me, that&rsquo;s way more impressive than 29-1, though I suppose it&rsquo;s splitting hairs. The season before that, the Spurs went 20-0 including the postseason (31-2 overall) which to me, being biased, is even more impressive though they ended up losing the next 4 in a row to that young, feisty OKC team:/</p>

      <label for="lmb0yn9" class="commentText"><p>28-1 wow. Btw if you were to minus 1 from 28, you&rsquo;d get 27, which is the number of consecutive 3Pts Rockets decided to miss in a win or go home conference finals match.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rank each team for their respective win streaks:</p>

<p>Warriors - Rockets 1a 1b</p>

<p>Heat - 2</p>
