      <label for="li7aog2" class="commentText"><p>Copied from user /u/poorchris, because this always comes up&hellip;</p>

<p>Joakim Noah only played 48 games the year Rose won MVP. Boozer missed 23 games &amp; when both returned their injuries lingered (turf toe/plantar fasciitis). In 2011 the Bulls had 62 wins with a rookie head coach. 38 year old Kurt Thomas started games for that team. Kyle Korver was getting skewered for his cold shooting slumps. Gibson &amp; Asik were raw projects. That year the Bulls were the Derrick Rose show <em>(featuring Luol Deng, occasionally, who delayed surgery to play with his torn wrist ligament)</em>.</p>

<p>MVP voting broke down with Rose 1st (113 #1 votes), Dwight 2nd (3 #1 votes) and Lebron 3rd (4 #1 votes). For reference, the only players to get more 1st place MVP votes than Rose in the last decade were &lsquo;04 KG &amp; &lsquo;10 Lebron.</p>

<p>Rose was Chicago&rsquo;s entire source of offense. He was responsible for 70% of the Bulls offense directly through PTS/AST when he was on the floor. Despite a dire lack of complimentary offensive talent, Derrick made Chicago a top 11 &amp; top 5 offense in separate seasons. The two seasons without him since, Chicago has been 23rd/28th. Equivalent to a lottery team.</p>

<p>Over the last decade only 3 teams have won a game with just one player scoring double digits. Chicago did that against the eventual champion Mavs behind Rose <em>(the other two to pull this off were Lebron &lsquo;09/Kobe &lsquo;06)</em>.</p>

<p>No team in the NBA leaned on one guy to create offense like the Bulls with Rose. And Rose flourished in crunch time to stack up wins for Chicago. Rose made more FG&rsquo;s in the 2nd half of games, on shots to tie or take the lead, than any player in the NBA. He shot 49% FG &amp; 56% 3PT <em>(14-25)</em> on those. Rose led all players in the same 4th Q shots too. Bron shot 38% FG &amp; 28% 3PT on shots to tie or take the lead in 4th Q&rsquo;s <em>(ranked 46th in FGM of that category, behind Jeff Green, Scola, Beasely, Granger, Tyreke Evans)</em>. That&rsquo;s not MVP.</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s own teammate was throwing down All NBA numbers <em>(and being Miami&rsquo;s go-to guy on crunch time shots)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>26 PPG  6.4 RPG  4.6 APG  1.5 SPG  1.1 BPG  50 FG%</strong> Wade</p>

<p>Bron had another MVP caliber player on his team and won fewer games than Rose. How does that make him more valuable?</p>

<p>Derrick&rsquo;s right hand man Carlos Boozer. He was a poor defender, missed 23 games that season and when he returned he averaged:</p>

<p><strong>17.5 PPG  9 RPG  2.5 APG  .3 BPG  51 FG%</strong> Boozer</p>

<p>Even Lebron&rsquo;s 3rd banana played above that level &amp; Miami STILL had a worse record than Chicago.</p>

<p><strong>19 PPG  8 RPG  2 APG  .6 BPG  50 FG%</strong> Bosh</p>

<p>Derrick didn&rsquo;t play with another all star that season, Lebron played with two. Derrick had less help &amp; his team had a better record than Lebron&rsquo;s. <a href="https://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/rose-dwarfs-other-improvements-with-defense/?_r=0" target="_blank">Rose also made a massive defensive leap that year.</a></p>

<p>Voter fatigued played no role in Rose&rsquo;s MVP selection. Winning more with less did. Rose had 97.7% of the possible point shares in the 2011 MVP voting. He received more points in the voting than Howard/Lebron combined. To suggest that media favoritism swung the scales <em>that</em> heavily is ridiculous.</p>

<p>To suggest that is to think Derrick Rose didn&rsquo;t have a historically great season on his own, one worthy of an MVP award. Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan &amp; Derrick Rose are the only players to win 62+ games without another All Star on their team. The only PG&rsquo;s to record 2000 PTS in a single season since 1981 are Gilbert Arenas &amp; Derrick Rose. Only three players since 1980 have had 2000 PTS/600 AST in a season, Jordan, Lebron &amp; Derrick Rose. No one has ever done it twice.</p>

<p>The 2000 point/600 assist benchmark is no arbitrary cutoff. If you decrease the cutoff to both 2000 PTS/500 AST the list remains elite. It adds Bird, Wade &amp; Iverson. If you keep the AST benchmark at 600 &amp; drop points to 1900 you add only Magic, G. Payton &amp; Westbrook. 9 players have reached any of those combined thresholds. The only ones not in the HOF are ineligible or still playing. None of those 6 names in the lower thresholds cross over to make both cuts either, the <sup>2000</sup>&frasl;<sub>500</sub> or <sup>1900</sup>&frasl;<sub>600</sub> groups. Making the <sup>2000</sup>&frasl;<sub>600</sub> club is tremendous, a benchmark for some of the most impressive seasons from a #1 option in history. Rose finished top 10 in both PTS &amp; AST because of this, only Bull to do that outside of MJ in 1989. Derrick had the most double doubles a Bull has had since Pippen in 1995.</p>

<p>In addition to everything else, don&rsquo;t forget that Rose&rsquo;s team started Keith Bogans &amp; 38 year old Kurt Thomas <strong>37 times that season.</strong>  Bogans started every single game that year. THAT team was top 11 offensively. THAT team won a league best 62 games, more than MIA, SAS, BOS with 4 All Stars, OKC&rsquo;s Big 3, the champ Mavs, B2B defending champ Lakers. They also swept MIA in the regular season &amp; MVP is a regular season award.</p>

<p>There are plenty reasons Rose deserved the &lsquo;11 MVP award. Don&rsquo;t take my word, take direct quotes from the 2011 season:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Derrick&rsquo;s probably the MVP of this league. I think he has all the tools to be one of the best that played this game. I think so far in my book he would be the MVP.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jason Kidd</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;He has stepped up and is now one of the best players in the league. I think he is worthy of MVP this year.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Steve Nash</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He&rsquo;s definitely the MVP to me the way he&rsquo;s been playing, putting pressure on teams &amp; stepping it up. He has been spectacular this year.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tyson Chandler</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have to start calling D Rose Mini Michael because his performance tonight was Jordan-like.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Magic Johnson</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;MVP of the season. He&rsquo;s playing that well. He deserves it without a doubt.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Derrick Rose is clearly the MVP. He&rsquo;s been tremendous down the stretch of games, he&rsquo;s been contagious on the defensive end &amp; he&rsquo;s headed towards 60 wins with two of his best players out. He has been spectacular.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Scottie Pippen</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;You look at what he&rsquo;s done for his team, it&rsquo;s tough to argue D Rose isn&rsquo;t the MVP.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Kevin Love</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;MVP. He&rsquo;s my MVP.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Z-Bo</strong> after CHI closed out MEM &amp; extended their home winning streak to 14.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s to the point of being unguaradble, you just hope to contain him as much as you can.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mike D&rsquo;Antoni</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I look at 39 PTS &amp; I&rsquo;m shocked at 39, I thought we did a very good job on him all night. Kid&rsquo;s just out of this world. He&rsquo;s [Rose] got Allen Iverson speed, Jason Kidd vision, Chauncey Billups shooting &amp; Michael Jordan athleticism. How do you guard that?&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Frank Vogel</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think Derrick has become the best point guard in the NBA and I think right now he has to be the front-runner for MVP. Derrick Rose has been a tremendous leader. He&rsquo;s missed his 2nd &amp; 3rd best players the majority of the season and they have the best record in the Eastern Conference. That&rsquo;s remarkable.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Charles Barkley</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The reason I put Derrick at the top [of MVP race] is what Chicago has been able to do. You&rsquo;ve got the next best players missing time or getting hurt on that team but they don&rsquo;t skip a beat. We&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to see it, this young man becoming a star late in games.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mike Breen</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I would vote Derrick Rose first [for MVP] without question. If you replace him with just a pretty good player the win total plummets and we&rsquo;re talking about the team who could have the most wins in the NBA.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jeff Van Gundy</strong></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;He [Rose] was already very, very good coming into the league. With him continuing to get better, it&rsquo;s scary.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>Scott Skiles</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Derrick is really having a tremendous year. I wouldn&rsquo;t be upset at all if he won it [MVP]. It&rsquo;s a hard choice to make, he&rsquo;s affecting the game despite missing some guys. At this point I&rsquo;d be pretty shocked if he [Rose] didn&rsquo;t win it.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stan Van Gundy</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised the Bulls are contending. Some people look at those injuries and they&rsquo;re surprised how many wins they have, but Derrick Rose is the best player this year in the NBA. I think he&rsquo;ll be the MVP, and when you have the MVP on your team, you&rsquo;re usually pretty good.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Doc Rivers</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I imagine that Derrick Rose is going to be that guy, the MVP. His team is 1st in the East right now. He&rsquo;s literally vaulted that team up on his shoulders by Boozer being out the first couple months.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Phil Jackson</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Rose is hard working, no chest thumping, and modest demeanor too. Just a class act. All of that on top of his phenomenal play. He has taken a monster leap this year. What&rsquo;s really great is that he seems to love the pressure in putting his team on his back. He has the character, IQ &amp; skill to do that.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Gregg Popovich</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I’m not even being politically correct, normally guys say I’m giving it to LeBron but honestly I’ll give it to Rose. If he stays on this pace that he’s on right now, he’s got my vote if I was part of the committee.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Juwan Howard</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Derrick has had a phenomenal season. Just looking at what he&rsquo;s done with the team and their record, how improved they are as a team and how much improved he is as a player. I think I would give it to Derrick if I were a voter. He’s playing, well, like he’s the best PG in the league &amp; the best player in the league. He’s the most valuable player if you really think about it. If you take him out of the lineup, there is no telling what you get.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Chris Bosh</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Derrick Rose definitely. He&rsquo;s the leader. What he&rsquo;s done for that team, with all the injuries they have and for them being 1st in the Eastern Conference. He&rsquo;s playing some unbelievable basketball.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Lebron</strong> when asked to weigh in on MVP race</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I have a different word for killers on the court, I call them bad motherfuckers. Right now Derrick Rose is the baddest motherfucker in the league by far. He is the reason we win.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Brian Scalabrine</strong></p>

<p>Talk of Rose winning MVP due to media bias is revisionist history. Rival Heat were even touting Rose as the MVP, along with the rest of the league &amp; the majority of those who cover it.</p>

Those two advanced stats don&rsquo;t even go back to Rose&rsquo;s peak.  It would be more realistic if you brought up PER or BPM.</p>

<p>Also people on this sub generally respect Rose.  The only times where people say he&rsquo;s overrated is in relation to him getting MVP over Lebron.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kyrie Irving is only 6&rsquo;1 and 3 quarters barefoot and compared to the average population he does have above average athleticsm and also really big hands which is a big reason why he can handle the ball so well and finish on 7 footers but obviously he relies way more on craft and skill than raw burst and hops like rose.</p>

      <label for="li5h2qc" class="commentText"><p>The issue with the nba now is that teams lack individual identity. Every team plays pretty much the same way or an aspired version of 4 shooters with one guy in the middle.</p>

<p>Back in this era, we had teams that relied on shooting threes (magic, early golden state, the spurs), we had grit and grind grizzlies, we had the young and super athletic thunder, the defensive-first bulls/someone I’m forgetting. There were so many unique ways teams were playing and it made the nba so much more interesting.</p>

<p>This isn’t just the nba though. The nfl and the mlb has done the same thing over the last 10 years. It’s the most detrimental aspect of analytics in sports imo</p>

I&rsquo;ve never seen such a good flowing offense like that before. The ball would not stick at all and they got a high % shot almost every possession. They looked like an actual machine running and were setting offensive records for the Finals.</p>

<p>The 4 games they won weren&rsquo;t even slightly competitive outside of maybe 1 quarter here and there. There&rsquo;s arguments for how bad that Heat team was compared to their previous year but in no world should they have looked that outclassed. The Heat looked several tiers below the Spurs and most of the credit has to goto that Spurs machine there.</p>

<p>Grizzlies with a slashing guard while starting two bigs</p>

<p>Bucks with a dominant PF playing twin towers with Lillard</p>

<p>Luka spread PnR with Kyrie being a dynamic scoring SG</p>

<p>Lakers 5 out featuring AD and a post up centric attack</p>

<p>King with Sabonis as an offensive hub and Fox working off that + shooters</p>

<p>Warriors system</p>

<p>Boston with a true 5 out style and 4-5 elite 3, D, drive and kick guys</p>

<p>76ers playing Embiid-centric post and heliocentric C actions</p>

<p>Nuggets playing the Jokic point Center system with DHOs</p>

<p>I can go on and on, the quality of a team&rsquo;s roster informs their playstyle to a heavy degree. Teams are all all hunting the same shots sure, but their best players are anything but homogenous and inform how the team goes about getting those shots.</p>

      <label for="li6gncw" class="commentText"><p>I think both are true. Some current top teams still specialize and have distinct identities. But all other teams tend to play the same way.</p>

<p>Whats changed is that the threshold for having a distinct identity is so much higher, and a team&rsquo;s superstar must be truly elite and efficient to inform the team&rsquo;s strategy.</p>

<p>If you dont have that franchise defining superstar, you&rsquo;re gonna play the most efficient way given your personnel and lack of talent. Cause if you dont, youre gonna lose.</p>

<p>Before analytics, battles between mediocre teams were a battle of different strategies based solely on gut feel of the coaching staff. But after analytics, the most efficient way to play has been figured out. And it became a battle of execution.</p>

<p>It seems you can&rsquo;t have a distinct identity if you are simply a mediocre team. Your strategy must be more efficient than the &ldquo;default&rdquo; way of playing.</p>

<p>I too enjoyed the Knicks pacers rivals and bulls pistons stuff.  </p>

<p>I also liked the jazz with Malone Stockton and hornacek.  </p>

<p>And those couple of years when the dream was winning and Jordan was retired were fun.  </p>

Defense is more interesting without the absurd spacing we see nowadays, because combining the bigger distance defenders have to cover with all the illegal screens being set on every single play means that offense is absurdly advantaged. That only makes the game more fun if you&rsquo;re engaging on the most unga bunga level of &ldquo;ball in basket good&rdquo;</p>

Even the Pistons had Wallace and Okur to stretch the floor.  It&rsquo;s probably the early 2000s Spurs with Robinson and Duncan and then Duncan and whoever their center was after Robinson retired (seriously who was it?).  Literally every successful team since then has featured 4 shooters in their strongest lineups.</p>

      <label for="li5hpxc" class="commentText"><p>Westbrook did not have a stronger frame at all. DRose was like a tank coming down the lane. He’s would always absorb contact from bigger players and still score over them. He literally had this move where he would tuck the basketball like a football and bully down the lane.</p>

<p>DRose was just as strong and explosive as Russ, if not more. Not to mention, Westbrook was much thinner in 2011. Westbrook now looks like whar Drose looked like in 2011</p>

<p>edit: I know 2011 was before everyone really started caring about efficiency but Games 2-5 he went <sup>32</sup>&frasl;<sub>98</sub> from the field (32.7%) including <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> from 3 (17.4%) in four straight losses.

<p>Could you imagine a Drose who still retained that level of athleticism who got consistent time to work on his jumper + ancillary skills.</p>

<p>He didn’t even get to John Wall’s YOE before he was a completely different player and folks think prime Wall was short/not what it could’ve been.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind that D Rose won the MVP.  Youngest MVP in NBA history. Great for the narrative, and Rose was also insanely good that year.  That&rsquo;s how he managed to steal the MVP from LeBron.</p>

<p>But no one could&rsquo;ve complained if LeBron had won the MVP instead.  It&rsquo;s LeBron, after all.  LeBron eventually guarded Rose personally 1v1 in their PLAYOFF matchup, and Rose was completely CLAMPED.    Bron definitely wanted to make a point, and Bulls got bullied in the end.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s no shot against Derrick Rose. He did his best..   Everyone got bullied against LeBron</p>

      <label for="li5v3cz" class="commentText"><p>The atmosphere of Bulls-Heat games was unreal in those years. All the regular season games had playoffs atmosphere. Even after Rose was out the games were intense as hell. I remember John Lucas III ate their defense up one of those games and led the Bulls to a win.</p>

<p>Those Bulls teams made every PG they got look good. I remember when Mike James came in on a 10 day contract and looked liked Deron Williams how unstoppable he was running the PnR with Boozer. No matter who the PG was on those teams, no one else could create their own shot so if a play failed then the ball always went to the PG to bail them out. John Lucas and Nate Robinson was almost certainly having the time of their lives getting that oppurtunity and they really didn&rsquo;t disappoint either.</p>
