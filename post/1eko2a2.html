    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>He&rsquo;s a pretty good scorer. Can shoot the ball well - career 36.4% and last year 40%. I haven&rsquo;t watched a lot of Blazers but from his build he can at least be an average defender. I feel like a lot of team could use an athletic wing like Jerami Grant on their team, but it seems like no one wants him. Is it because the blazers are putting the price to high?</p>

      <label for="lgn4b6g" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s exactly this.  Grant is a good player, who&rsquo;s offense and 3 point shooting has improved tremendously.  He&rsquo;s defense has probably fallen a bit, but likely serviceable.  I think the biggest knock on him is he doesn&rsquo;t rebound.  Feels like he&rsquo;s a very specific role player for a team and I don&rsquo;t think there are a ton of teams that need a player who just scores well and doesn&rsquo;t do a bit of dirty work like defense and rebounding.</p>

      <label for="lgn8azf" class="commentText"><p>Mentioned this above, but I think he’s filling the role asked of him, especially with Portland. He’s definitely a better off-ball defender than point of attack, but I bet if a team needed him to play 3 &amp; D, he would glad accept the role and his defense would come back up.</p>

<p>Portland had very little offensive weapons last year. Even if ISO Jerami isn’t efficient for the league, for the Blazers’ most of the season it was the most efficient option, even if defenses knew it.</p>

<p>I mean, I think that was basically what the Nuggets wanted from him, but instead he chose to leave to go and be the leading scorer on the Pistons for a couple of seasons. He might have a different attitude to it now, though.</p>

      <label for="lgn7s02" class="commentText"><p>I disagree with that, Jerami’s game is much more flexible than Ingram. I do agree that he’s not a true star, but without complaint he’ll play whatever role the team needs.</p>

<p>He tried being the guy at Detroit and wasn’t quite there, but when he first came to Portland he was primarily a spot up shooter and pushed the pace. After Dame, Portland had very little shooting and when healthy Ant was asked to be a facilitator.</p>

<p>Him playing ISO ball was literally the best option on offense with Simon’s getting doubled and the rest of the defenders touching paint.</p>

<p>He’ll never be a good rebounder, but he will focus on whichever role-player need a team has and have a good attitude about it. Having some ISO game in his back pocket isn’t a bad thing, in the right scenario he can help out when sets fall apart. Just shouldn’t be the primary reason he’s on the team.</p>

<p>Also, he’s not injury prone. Portland has been winning proned to end the last three seasons.</p>

      <label for="lglzi7n" class="commentText"><p>Well that, and the Blazers are also asking for (IMO) too much. Like you said, the main reason why there aren&rsquo;t more interested teams is his very large contract. But Portland FO, and many of their fans, seem to think that his contract is good and are asking for a lot in return, it was reported 2 FRP. And I&rsquo;m not saying his contract is horrible, he is a good player, but he is overpaid.</p>

<p>I am sure that he would actually be worth 2 firsts + matching salary if Jerami was making 20-25M a year similar to guys like Kuzma, but I just can&rsquo;t see someone paying that much for a guy making 33M/year on average. His contract definitely lowers his overall value.</p>

      <label for="lgn3u26" class="commentText"><p>I think would be reasonable for some contenders to overpay him if that meant to fix a weak spot on their roster, the thing is (with the second apron) they just can&rsquo;t. For no contenders it makes no sense.</p>

<p>He would be a really good fit to some contenders as a 3rd/4th option, but most of them either don&rsquo;t have the necessary salary cap to absorb his contract, or lack the compensation asked for him without dismantle their team. He would be a great fit for Suns for example, as they lack capable wings outside KD, but they would need to get rid of Beal, who has that stupid no trade clause and will make 50m+ next season. Clippers, with PG gone, would make sense as I think they have sufficient salary to make work it out. The truth is very likely that someone will pay what Portland is asking for him. The market for good wings is very hot (Brigdes, OG, Markkanen, PG, Kuzma, and eventually Grant I think).</p>

It would need to be THJ, Maxi and Green plus the last two FRPs. As many questions as I have on Klay, I rather have his contract and the upside of Grimes over Grant&rsquo;s mammoth deal lingering (also, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure we would have gone for Naji if we got Grant).</p>

<p>His cap % is 20% and it’s going to go down every year. He’s making 30m, 32m, 34m, and 36m. His previous contract was 17% of the cap (equivalent value of 25m this season) and it was universally agreed on he was underpaid.</p>

<p>It’s 3% of the cap if a not that big of a difference.</p>

      <label for="lgojh9u" class="commentText"><p>That means he should be around 2nd best player on an average team, which is roughly 3rd best player on a contender.</p>

<p>Is he good enough to be the clear cut 3rd best player for top contenders like Celtics or Nuggets? Obviously not in Boston. He may be better than MPJ, but he is a worse fit since MPJ is a lengthy shooter - and we haven’t even touched on the topic of AG being probably more important than MPJ anyway.</p>

<p>Would he be good for a second tier ones like Mavs, OKC, Wolves, 76ers or Knicks? Maybe Dallas over Klay (unless Lively takes a leap to 3rd best player for Mavs), but he is not better than J-Dub (especially accounting for age) or either of Gobert/KAT or OG/Bridges.</p>

<p>Miami gets a dependable scorer, gets off of two contracts they keep trying to give away.
Phoenix balances their roster
Portland gets draft picks, a scorer to pair with Scoot (with better size than Simons).</p>

<p>And I’m sure that’s true for Sharpe, but they’ve been looking to move Simons.</p>

His athletic peak may be behind him, but he’s improved shooting and ball handling. As well as being a smart help defender. Age isn’t the only thing when you’re slotting your 3 best starter.</p>

<p>If there’s no trade that’s fine, Portland doesn’t have any other 4s close to his level.</p>

      <label for="lgmm07w" class="commentText"><p>I think the Blazers will come down on their price and just wanted to capitalize when the market was shrinking to get a panicking team to bite. Lakers were pretty smart to not overpay immediately BUT I do think Grant would be the PERFECT fit for them, same with the Kings and Mavs because they have guys that can make up for his lack of rebounding and playmaking. Grant is essentially a 6&rsquo;8 SG that can defend, shoot, and get to the rim on anyone. His playmaking and rebounding are almost nonexistent but for teams that have offensive hubs that can rebound like Lebron/Luka/Sabonis/Draymond, Grant fits perfect because he can soak up possessions on offense AND play off ball and feast in transition.</p>

<p>Eventually Grant will probably get moved for a Terry Rozier type package and everyone is going to crap on Cronin coming down on his asking price lol. If Grant only had 2 years left and not 4, then he would be way more valuable too.</p>

He’s a pretty flexible player and had the green light for scoring because that’s what the team needed. But he’s pretty good across the board (except for boards ;) and happily plays whichever role you need.</p>

<p>I don’t know what they’d offer though to make it happen. I don’t think Portland is fixed on 2 firsts, but I do think they want a young player that fits or 2 firsts. They’d probably take a bad expiring or two year contract back if they got the picks or young player in return.</p>

      <label for="lgomm21" class="commentText"><p>Mavs would need to give up the only 2 FRPs they have + salary filler at this point, which would be a chip or a bust play on 34 year old Klay, 32 year old Kyrie and 30 year old Grant since Dallas would have very limited future assets to reinforce roster around Luka in 3-4 years. That also creates an odd situation where Luka-Kyrie-Klay-Grant-PJ will be competing for 4 starting spots, with probably Klay dropping into 6th man spot, but would he be willing to do so?</p>

      <label for="lgmvhkh" class="commentText"><p>I think he is happy doing what he is doing. Which is playing basketball in a low stress environments making tons of money. Grant seems to want a larger role in a teams offence, it’s one of the reasons he left Denver in the first place. Any team that is thinking of traded for Grant probably wants him to be their third option on offence at best. It doesn’t seem like Grant wants that reduce role.</p>

<p>Why teams don’t want him is mostly due to how much money he is making and will be making for the next four seasons. His contract will carry him till he is <sup>34</sup>&frasl;<sub>35</sub>. No team wants to be paying Grant a high level role player that much at that age.</p>

However, he also slotted in great as a number two with Dame once he got that bag and I doubt he&rsquo;d care about being a third or fourth option for a winner. Maybe having the bag makes him harder for a winner to acquire, but I don&rsquo;t think he has some need to be the number one option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily condemning that, just saying we know that&rsquo;s his priority. Or at least it was back then, money over winning. Maybe that&rsquo;s changed now but if I was a GM I wouldn&rsquo;t trust him, especially not for that salary with the second apron and his age.</p>

Most of his missed games are late season shut downs. If anything he&rsquo;s had as much rehab and conditioning time as anyone in the NBA over his last four seasons. If I were a GM I would not be worried about the miles on his legs one bit. Obviously do due diligence with the medicals, but he does not seem like a guy you generally worry about through his age 33 season.</p>

<p>Kuzma who is similar to him makes 23 mil now and will make 20 mil in 4 years. McDaniels and Gordon also make around 23 million and are proven winners or younger. Turner makes 20 mil and is much younger and better. It&rsquo;s just not a good contract for the money.</p>

<p>Anyone who gets him will be guaranteed to be locked at the second apron with a 30 year old wing whose value will only keep dropping while his salary increases.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lgm8h7i" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the use of those comps. First - to be clear, he&rsquo;s closer as a player in terms of what he offers to Holiday, Randle, Bridges than he is to Kuzma, McDaniels, Turner. But lets look at that list&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Randle and Bridges both signed their deals a while ago, and are at the tail end of their deal. Even the Grant deal, which you note is backloaded, still projects to decrease as a share of cap on a year over year basis. Both Bridges and Randle will soon cost a <strong><em>LOT</em></strong> more than Jerami Grant.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re prone to worrying about players&rsquo; ages, then the skill gap:salary similarity between Grant and Holiday can be entirely explained by the fact that Holiday is beginning his deal at the same age Grant will begin <em>his next</em> deal. Holiday is a 34 year old with way more miles on his legs recently, 4 consecutive playoff years plus two consecutive summers with Team USA.</li>
<li>Porzingis is going to struggle to get full value for his skill set because he&rsquo;s famously fragile, and no matter how he performs the next two seasons his value is probably going to be depressed next time he gets to free agency.</li>
<li>Jerami makes a lot more than Kuzma for one big reason, along with a few other smaller ones: he can shoot. Last year Kuzma shot a career high from the line, he was still 38 points worse than Grant&rsquo;s worst season from the line in the last 4. Grant has also been reliable from deep for 6 years now, whereas Kuzma has only been mediocre once in his career. As a #1 shooting pull ups, Grant is still able to match the overall league average. And as a #2 he&rsquo;s been a 39-40% guy since he was in Oklahoma City. He is loads more reliable than Kuz.</li>
<li>Aaron Gordon just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I get it - Jerami Grant should not be way more expensive than Aaron Gordon. Denver absolutely got him at a weird discount, I thought he had a breakout as a guy willing to play a role for a banged up Orlando team on his way out and then when he showed up in Denver he just seemed to unlock major things for them. But, like Randle and Bridges, he&rsquo;s about to cost a <strong><em>LOT</em></strong> more than Jerami Grant. He&rsquo;s going to opt out, and he&rsquo;s going to get handed a lot of money soon.</li>
<li>I just plain don&rsquo;t think Turner and McDaniels are as valuable to a team as he is. I think McDaniels can get there, I don&rsquo;t think Turner can. I think in a different CBA, McDaniels woulda been offered quite a lot more by someone for his second contract, on the assumption that he&rsquo;d be good enough to earn it by the end.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything is contextual.</p>

      <label for="lgmoi6i" class="commentText"><p>The idea of a max contract compressed the top end of the salary range. So the best and most valuable players, be that a LeBron, Steph, KD, Joker, Luka, etc. make roughly the same percentage of the salary cap as the least talented people still good enough to earn a max, i.e. a Zach Lavine, like Lauri Markannen in a few days, or Jerami Grant.</p>

<p>None of those guys are bad players but in relation to their contracts they don&rsquo;t represent good value. With the new CBA and onerus 2nd apron this matters even more for teams, not tying up a bunch of cap in a player who&rsquo;s only decent.</p>

<p>The main issues with JG is his age and the length of his deal. I think if it was a  four year deal it would be easier to trade. Teams don&rsquo;t like to commit to money long term anymore. That&rsquo;s why a lot of deals are like 3 years now.</p>

<p>But overall he&rsquo;s not overpaid if you only look at his AAV. For next season he&rsquo;s actually 55th in AAV. He&rsquo;s down around CJ, Jordan Poole, Quickley, Jamal Murray, etc.</p>

Wolves, Mavs, and OKC all got bigger the last two years with trades/free agents (Hartenstein, Gobert, PJ, Gafford, etc). Boston swapped out Smart for KP essentially. Cleveland and Orlando have drafted a lot of size. Pacers traded for Siakam. NY went out and traded for two lengthy wings. The nuggets have always played big with a Jokic/MPJ/Gordon front court.</p>

      <label for="lgooyxo" class="commentText"><p>Celtics basically have 2 NBA level bigs on that roster with 1 injured for half a season and the other being 39 years old. I wouldn’t say they went for size when Tatum plays primarily PF.</p>

<p>Mavs with PJ at the 4 are not that big either, he is not a real big man, he is a wing. OKC finally got Hartenstein after playing 6’5” JDub at the 4 and having their back-up 5 being 6’8”. Sure, we may see some Hartenstein-Chet pairings, but those will be maybe like 10 minutes per game on average and they will mostly split C minutes depending on matchups. I’m pretty sure OKC will still gravitate towards 5-out smallish ball similar to Celtics.</p>

<p>Pacers didn’t have a starting level PF before the trade (Obi Toppin is not a starter on an outside contender).</p>

<p>Wolves, Nuggets, Cavs and Orlando are big though.</p>

There&rsquo;s a very good chance he&rsquo;s just not a contributing player at the end of the contract.  Also, he doesn&rsquo;t really do anything well besides be an okay scorer.  He&rsquo;s not a good rebounder, isn&rsquo;t a good passer, doesn&rsquo;t generate turnovers or really provide any weak side rim protection anymore.</p>

      <label for="lgm7szh" class="commentText"><p>IMO the contract value isn&rsquo;t that bad, but it goes for FOUR years and those last two years especially could get ugly. It feels like a contract that costs you assets to acquire and then costs you assets to move off of. It&rsquo;s similar to Lavine&rsquo;s in that it&rsquo;s too long. If Lavine&rsquo;s contract was set to end in 2026, I think he would have been traded actually.</p>

Everyone who brings up his missed games really can&rsquo;t point to any injury he has suffered because its largely due to Portland tanking. The only thing that has kept him out of games the past two years has been concussions and he actually returns from them quickly given how many he suffered last 2 years.</p>

Taking those penalties for Grant, who is mostly just going to be a high end role player, probably just isn&rsquo;t worth it for many teams.</p>

Price is a little high rn too but Portland is fine sitting until the trade deadline, maybe next off season as well. Portland is risking him declining, or an injury not moving him immediately, but he’s a solid player to have around young players to off load the burden on the younger guys.</p>

<p>I’m sure Portland will drop their price this season.</p>

Plays timid, gets bullied by anyone with any sort of strength. Doesn’t really contribute to winning basketball. He’s an overpaid role player who’s trying to fill a bigger role in Portland. The blazers have a few guys like that (ayton, Simon’s, Grant), none of which I think would actually help a win now team much.</p>

      <label for="lgnt1qp" class="commentText"><p>Guys who score a lot at near-average efficiency don&rsquo;t help you win as much as the conventional wisdom and eye-test tend to make us think unless they bring other things to the table as well.</p>

<p>In only one of his high-usage years has he been an above-average efficiency scorer. And it wasn&rsquo;t like he was lighting the world on fire that year - his TS+ was 104, which, you know, is solid, but it&rsquo;s really not anything special.</p>

<p>A high usage guy with a 104 TS+ who is a good creator for other players, a good rebounder, and a good defender is basically Jayson Tatum. But, again, that&rsquo;s Grant&rsquo;s high-water mark as a high-usage guy, his other three high-usage years he&rsquo;s been below average. And he doesn&rsquo;t bring all that other stuff to the table that Tatum brings.</p>

<p>(And that lower efficiency is a big reason why Tatum is not in the elite group of players. As point of reference, KD was 108 last year, and that was a significantly down year for him - he&rsquo;s generally been up over 110, 10% better than league average).</p>

<p>His impact metrics have never been very far from 0 - league average - and sometimes they&rsquo;re quite poor (generally dragged down by his defense, which LEBRON rated as -1.6 last year).</p>

He can’t guard quick guards well, and can’t provide meaningful secondary rim protection, which leaves him in a bit of an tweener between the two forward spots. On offense, he is good, but just not quite good enough to be a real force on a good contender. He feels like he’s the bad fit version of Bridges or Anunoby, yet paid like an absolute top class roleplayer/ 3rd option.</p>

      <label for="lgnym9h" class="commentText"><p>Besides cost, age, and previous desire to chase touches rather than be a third or fourth option on a contender, there&rsquo;s one more issue:</p>

<p>He can&rsquo;t rebound at all. Which hurts teams that would want him to play 4 in a small ball lineup.</p>

<p>Combine age, salary, role questions, rebounding/small ball fit, and then add the fact Portland wants an asset back, and you have the current market.</p>

<p>With the choices he&rsquo;s made in his career, Grant may well be happy making his money and putting up relatively empty 20s and being &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; on a bad team. Not everyone hungers for a championship.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s guaranteed 3/<span class="math inline">\(96 with a player option that would make the deal 4/\)</span>132.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s spent the last four years on either DET or POR.</p>

<p>Fair question as to whether he&rsquo;s just so far removed from winning that he&rsquo;ll never fit into a winning team again.</p>

<p>Also, there&rsquo;s the fact he&rsquo;s either 4/$132 or 3+even bigger extension. For a guy that may well not start on a serious team. Definitely will never be anything close to a #1 or #2. #3 is probably only realistic if the Luka and Joker are on his team.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;s your 2nd option, all hes doing is stealing shots from your first option. We traded him from the Pistons because he was just flat out in the way of Cade&rsquo;s development because he is physically incapable of passing the ball in a half court situation.</p>
