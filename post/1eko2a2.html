    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>He&rsquo;s a pretty good scorer. Can shoot the ball well - career 36.4% and last year 40%. I haven&rsquo;t watched a lot of Blazers but from his build he can at least be an average defender. I feel like a lot of team could use an athletic wing like Jerami Grant on their team, but it seems like no one wants him. Is it because the blazers are putting the price to high?</p>

      <label for="lglzi7n" class="commentText"><p>Well that, and the Blazers are also asking for (IMO) too much. Like you said, the main reason why there aren&rsquo;t more interested teams is his very large contract. But Portland FO, and many of their fans, seem to think that his contract is good and are asking for a lot in return, it was reported 2 FRP. And I&rsquo;m not saying his contract is horrible, he is a good player, but he is overpaid.</p>

<p>I am sure that he would actually be worth 2 firsts + matching salary if Jerami was making 20-25M a year similar to guys like Kuzma, but I just can&rsquo;t see someone paying that much for a guy making 33M/year on average. His contract definitely lowers his overall value.</p>

      <label for="lglz274" class="commentText"><p>He wanted to be able to show the breadth of his skillset and earn a much bigger bag than he ever could have by staying in his lane in Denver. However, he also slotted in great as a number two with Dame once he got that bag and I doubt he&rsquo;d care about being a third or fourth option for a winner. Maybe having the bag makes him harder for a winner to acquire, but I don&rsquo;t think he has some need to be the number one option.</p>

      <label for="lgm05uk" class="commentText"><p>I distinctly remember reports saying he wanted a bigger role at the time, whether that was because of pride or money we don&rsquo;t know. Either way, the end result is he chased the bag instead of winning.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily condemning that, just saying we know that&rsquo;s his priority. Or at least it was back then, money over winning. Maybe that&rsquo;s changed now but if I was a GM I wouldn&rsquo;t trust him, especially not for that salary with the second apron and his age.</p>

      <label for="lgm114l" class="commentText"><p>Eh&hellip;. 30? He&rsquo;s only been really injured during the season once in the last four years. Most of his missed games are late season shut downs. If anything he&rsquo;s had as much rehab and conditioning time as anyone in the NBA over his last four seasons. If I were a GM I would not be worried about the miles on his legs one bit. Obviously do due diligence with the medicals, but he does not seem like a guy you generally worry about through his age 33 season.</p>

<p>Kuzma who is similar to him makes 23 mil now and will make 20 mil in 4 years. McDaniels and Gordon also make around 23 million and are proven winners or younger. Turner makes 20 mil and is much younger and better. It&rsquo;s just not a good contract for the money.</p>

<p>Anyone who gets him will be guaranteed to be locked at the second apron with a 30 year old wing whose value will only keep dropping while his salary increases.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lgm8h7i" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the use of those comps. First - to be clear, he&rsquo;s closer as a player in terms of what he offers to Holiday, Randle, Bridges than he is to Kuzma, McDaniels, Turner. But lets look at that list&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Randle and Bridges both signed their deals a while ago, and are at the tail end of their deal. Even the Grant deal, which you note is backloaded, still projects to decrease as a share of cap on a year over year basis. Both Bridges and Randle will soon cost a <strong><em>LOT</em></strong> more than Jerami Grant.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re prone to worrying about players&rsquo; ages, then the skill gap:salary similarity between Grant and Holiday can be entirely explained by the fact that Holiday is beginning his deal at the same age Grant will begin <em>his next</em> deal. Holiday is a 34 year old with way more miles on his legs recently, 4 consecutive playoff years plus two consecutive summers with Team USA.</li>
<li>Porzingis is going to struggle to get full value for his skill set because he&rsquo;s famously fragile, and no matter how he performs the next two seasons his value is probably going to be depressed next time he gets to free agency.</li>
<li>Jerami makes a lot more than Kuzma for one big reason, along with a few other smaller ones: he can shoot. Last year Kuzma shot a career high from the line, he was still 38 points worse than Grant&rsquo;s worst season from the line in the last 4. Grant has also been reliable from deep for 6 years now, whereas Kuzma has only been mediocre once in his career. As a #1 shooting pull ups, Grant is still able to match the overall league average. And as a #2 he&rsquo;s been a 39-40% guy since he was in Oklahoma City. He is loads more reliable than Kuz.</li>
<li>Aaron Gordon just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I get it - Jerami Grant should not be way more expensive than Aaron Gordon. Denver absolutely got him at a weird discount, I thought he had a breakout as a guy willing to play a role for a banged up Orlando team on his way out and then when he showed up in Denver he just seemed to unlock major things for them. But, like Randle and Bridges, he&rsquo;s about to cost a <strong><em>LOT</em></strong> more than Jerami Grant. He&rsquo;s going to opt out, and he&rsquo;s going to get handed a lot of money soon.</li>
<li>I just plain don&rsquo;t think Turner and McDaniels are as valuable to a team as he is. I think McDaniels can get there, I don&rsquo;t think Turner can. I think in a different CBA, McDaniels woulda been offered quite a lot more by someone for his second contract, on the assumption that he&rsquo;d be good enough to earn it by the end.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything is contextual.</p>

      <label for="lgmvhkh" class="commentText"><p>I think he is happy doing what he is doing. Which is playing basketball in a low stress environments making tons of money. Grant seems to want a larger role in a teams offence, it’s one of the reasons he left Denver in the first place. Any team that is thinking of traded for Grant probably wants him to be their third option on offence at best. It doesn’t seem like Grant wants that reduce role.</p>

<p>Why teams don’t want him is mostly due to how much money he is making and will be making for the next four seasons. His contract will carry him till he is <sup>34</sup>&frasl;<sub>35</sub>. No team wants to be paying Grant a high level role player that much at that age.</p>

      <label for="lgmm07w" class="commentText"><p>I think the Blazers will come down on their price and just wanted to capitalize when the market was shrinking to get a panicking team to bite. Lakers were pretty smart to not overpay immediately BUT I do think Grant would be the PERFECT fit for them, same with the Kings and Mavs because they have guys that can make up for his lack of rebounding and playmaking. Grant is essentially a 6&rsquo;8 SG that can defend, shoot, and get to the rim on anyone. His playmaking and rebounding are almost nonexistent but for teams that have offensive hubs that can rebound like Lebron/Luka/Sabonis/Draymond, Grant fits perfect because he can soak up possessions on offense AND play off ball and feast in transition.</p>

<p>Eventually Grant will probably get moved for a Terry Rozier type package and everyone is going to crap on Cronin coming down on his asking price lol. If Grant only had 2 years left and not 4, then he would be way more valuable too.</p>

      <label for="lgmoi6i" class="commentText"><p>The idea of a max contract compressed the top end of the salary range. So the best and most valuable players, be that a LeBron, Steph, KD, Joker, Luka, etc. make roughly the same percentage of the salary cap as the least talented people still good enough to earn a max, i.e. a Zach Lavine, like Lauri Markannen in a few days, or Jerami Grant.</p>

<p>None of those guys are bad players but in relation to their contracts they don&rsquo;t represent good value. With the new CBA and onerus 2nd apron this matters even more for teams, not tying up a bunch of cap in a player who&rsquo;s only decent.</p>

It feels like a contract that costs you assets to acquire and then costs you assets to move off of. It&rsquo;s similar to Lavine&rsquo;s in that it&rsquo;s too long. If Lavine&rsquo;s contract was set to end in 2026, I think he would have been traded actually.</p>

      <label for="lgms69e" class="commentText"><p>The issue isn&rsquo;t the player.  It&rsquo;s his contract along with the aprons.  Owed an average of $32M over the next 4 year and the final year is a player option.  The apron penalties have every team outside the Celtics absolutely shook right now.  Taking those penalties for Grant, who is mostly just going to be a high end role player, probably just isn&rsquo;t worth it for many teams.</p>

      <label for="lgmkzub" class="commentText"><p>Jerami Grant had a defensive rating of 119.7 and nets negative defense. You can say that he&rsquo;s serviceable in certain situations, and that he can hang when focused.  But is he willing to live in that role is an open question.</p>

      <label for="lgmhx38" class="commentText"><p>He’s one of those dudes that can put up decent numbers when given the opportunity but functions best as like a number three on a good team. He’s just really pricey for 21/5/3 (I didn’t actually look that up just ball-parking) on just okay efficiency.</p>

      <label for="lglxqc5" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a good player, but he&rsquo;s been injured quite regularly for several years now and you&rsquo;d have to match 30 million a year to get him. I do think he&rsquo;s underrated, reliable, well defending wings are difficult to get, but which team could use him now and in the future? He&rsquo;s not really a guy you build a team around and as a complementary player he&rsquo;s expensive.</p>

<p>That all said, I think he&rsquo;d be a great addition for the Pacers, him and Siakam as forwards will bring size, reasonable defense and shooting. But we&rsquo;d have to give up Turner, Nesmith, a youngster (quite possibly Mathurin or Walker) and a pick to make it happen and that is just too much.</p>
