      <label for="l6wzn6x" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the variance of scoring. In MLB where the average game has 9 runs scored or NHL where the average game has 6 Goals scored, the variance is much higher allowing for a less talented team to steal a win. In the NBA where there are 200+ pts scored, the sample size is so big that the better team can win more often than not.</p>

<p>You see this reflected in the regular season where it&rsquo;s not uncommon for multiple NBA teams to have a Win % of .700+ but even the best teams are only around .620 in the MLB or the NHL where a 60+ win team or even multiple 55+ win teams is extremely rare.</p>

<p>That said, I think this is a sign of things to come for the NBA for two reasons, I think the three point shot creates more of that random volatility from game to game, allowing upsets to happen (Miami last year), and mid-season player movement allows for teams to improve massively mid-season like we&rsquo;re seeing with the Mavs so they&rsquo;re coming into the playoffs &lsquo;underseeded&rsquo;</p>

      <label for="l6x04ex" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s both - the other guy has a point too. In basketball your stars are on the floor most of the game. In hockey that never applies, so the individual influence of a star is diminished. Even if they&rsquo;re dominant every time they&rsquo;re on the ice, they aren&rsquo;t on the ice most of the game</p>

      <label for="l6x3mmz" class="commentText"><p>The variance issue is still more important. Because in Hockey over the course of a season you still get teams that are clearly better than others. In basketball you just happen to see the difference much faster. To put it another way, if Hockey can hypothetically use Bo30 as their playoff series, you would see a lot fewer upsets. This is why the Premier League despite soccer being a very high variance sports tend to have basically the same teams on top each season. Cause there&rsquo;s no playoffs to muck things up.</p>

<p>Well in basketball spamming your best player is a serious offensive game plan, and the player is also 20% of your entire defense. So the impact a player like MJ and Lebron had on both ends of the floor is just so tremendous that it is difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>Now you have to overcome that 4 times out of 7.</p>

Talent spread across 8-9 rotation players vs. 20+ in the NHL or MLB you&rsquo;ll naturally have less variance in game to game performance and the ability for one or two players&rsquo; impact to show.</p>

<p>Hockey rosters also have goalies that can either be on a heater and steal games or be terrible and it doesn’t matter how good your team is they will let in terrible goals.</p>

<p>Just a lot more team play needed to that in the nba where stars have more impact due to less variable like no goalies and they play way more minutes.</p>

      <label for="l6z8axo" class="commentText"><p>Not only variance within games is low, but the NBA series are seven games long, which makes it tied with hockey for the longest postseason in major American sports. The average NBA first seed wins 60 games for a win percentage of .732. There&rsquo;s opponent quality to consider, but if we take that as a guess of expected win percentage for a first-round game, then one seeds should win 91% of first round series.</p>

<p>Out of the 44 1v8 series that have happened since the first round went to seven games in 2003, 5 have ended in upsets, so the math checks out pretty well.</p>

<p>Compare that to baseball, the best MLB record ever was 116-32, for a win percentage of .716. Over a five game series, a team with a .716 expected win percentage for a first round game would only win 72% of the time.</p>

If a guy is a league-average hitter, then probably every 3rd game is an abject offensive failure, because he&rsquo;ll get 4 or 5 plate appearances, and 3-4 strikeouts and maybe a walk. But 1 in 3 games will also have multiple hits. There is almost no way to judge an individuals hitter&rsquo;s performance based on a single game.</p>

When the top <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teams can stack their teams by spending 7-8 times as much as the other teams and create all-star lineups the variance will decrease.</p>

<p>There also isn&rsquo;t a playoff system so effectively you have a full season sample size instead of a 4-7 game series.</p>

      <label for="l716x9a" class="commentText"><p>Because soccer has completely different rules around salary than the NBA. UEFA does not have a salary cap, so winning teams get more fans, get more sponsors, get more money, which allow them to attract better talent, to win more, to get more fans&hellip;</p>

<p>Football also doesn&rsquo;t really have a draft or lottery system the way the <strong>NBA</strong> does in many cases.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s look at the NBA. The most expensive roster (this season) is Golden State with <strong>$209m</strong>.</p>

<p>The Second most expensive is the Clippers with <strong>$202m</strong>. Over 90% of the highest.</p>

<p>The median (Trailblazers and Knicks) are around <strong>$165m</strong> (or around 80% of the max).</p>

<p>The lowest is the Magic at around <strong>$132m</strong>, which is still more than half of the highest.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the <strong>Bundesliga</strong>.</p>

<p>First is Bayern München: <strong>€273m</strong></p>

<p>Second is Borussia Dortmund at <strong>€121m</strong>. That&rsquo;s less than <em>half</em> of the first place.</p>

<p>Median is between <strong>€31m</strong> and <strong>€34m</strong> (Mainz and Stuttgart, respectively) or between 10% and 20% of the number 1.</p>

<p>Last place is Heidenheim with a salary of <strong>€11m</strong> or just over 4% of the highest team.</p>

      <label for="l6z2lpp" class="commentText"><p>Hockey is more &ldquo;random&rdquo; than basketball (and most other sports for that matter), for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Even the most elite hockey players only play one-third of any game. Its just too physically demanding, so most of any match is played by &ldquo;replacement-level&rdquo; talents. Top-level NBA players play two-thirds of an average game.</p></li>

<li><p>Basketball is high scoring, thus each player has a lot of attempts in which to assert their skill. Greater sample sizes reduce the variance.</p></li>

<li><p>Height is not a huge advantage in hockey, like it is in basketball. The average adult male is 5&rsquo;9&rdquo;, but the shortest basketball players are above 6&rsquo;, with many in the 7&rsquo;s. Since height is seemingly a requirement, it dramatically reduces the talent pool. How many people in the world are above 7&rsquo; and how many of those can play basketball at a professional level? Because there is such a small sample of people in that height category, there is a much greater variance amongst the skill level of those players. In hockey, teams are drawing on the much greater talent pool of people of most any height, thus the difference between the best and worst players in the league is drastically reduced.</p></li>

      <label for="l6ykh1i" class="commentText"><p>It’s mostly cause offense is so efficient and there’s so many scores in a game, it kind of sands out the statistical unlikely results. Either you can get it in consistently for 40 minutes or you can’t, there’s no room for a strong iron wall of defense with a cheeky counter attack goal on the last minute that gives you the victory or something like that.</p>

<p>In all elite sports those statistical efficiencies tend to give victories over the long run, but in basketball it’s just so much more brutal. You just get ground into fine sand.</p>

      <label for="l6wy3wk" class="commentText"><p>Hockey is overall a lower scoring game, which allows for more potential statistical variance and accordingly, more upsets. A lot easier to pull off an upset when there are maybe 6-7 total scores (plenty are way less than that) in a 60 minute game with possession being less concrete. Basketball just on the number of controlled possessions each team has is bound to be the most statistically normal of all the major sports, and when coupled with a best-of-7 format, that just doesnt lend itself to many upsets (as opposed to March Madness where there are plenty because its single-elimination).</p>

Thunder were the least injured team on the year which absolutely helped them build chemistry and earn their 1 seed.</p>

      <label for="l6xjcnp" class="commentText"><p>Jason Kidd seems to only care about the post season. The regular season to him is just a way to experiment to see what works and doesn&rsquo;t work for the post season. He will stick with seemingly worse players because he wants to see how he can use everyone&rsquo;s positive side. THJ did see some minutes in the playoffs until he did the inevitable jacking up of bricks with confidence, Kidd put a stop to that and I haven&rsquo;t seen him play since then. Kidd isn&rsquo;t playing with rotations anymore. Since the trade deadline the Mavs have a 75% win percentage in the regular season.</p>

<p>You pair him with another PG who can create for himself during dry spells and can elevate bench players (Kyrie, CP3). You play them both together for the majority of the game, but also you make sure one of them is always on the court.</p>

<p>Get a rim runner, classic big. They&rsquo;re relatively cheap and easy to get since everyone else wants a stretch 5 nowadays for spacing. (Gafford/rookie contract Lively, Capela). They catch lobs and protect the paint.</p>

<p>Finally you just load up on wings who can hit threes and switch on defense. Can&rsquo;t even name all the dudes this applies to. Like 5 guys on the Mavs and same for the Rockets.</p>

      <label for="l6z2n3a" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, probably better phrased as just every team that has won a title in NBA finals history finished seeded top 3 <em>or</em> are defending champs.</p>

<p>I think they were trying to phrase it more generically like if the current core of the team recently won a championship; like if the 2025 Nuggets win as #4 seed next year &ndash; they wouldn&rsquo;t be defending champs, but the players have recently won a championship so for most of the team it wouldn&rsquo;t be their first championship as a Nugget with the team.  Like yes, the 2011 Mavericks won a championship so it won&rsquo;t be their first, but that has no bearing on the current team (other than current coach Jason Kidd played on the 2011 team).</p>

More importantly, they had the most successful trade deadline ever and they&rsquo;re a different team with Gafford and PJ. Kyrie also missed some games early on. This is just a completely different team than the one that played during the first half of the season.</p>

<p>In my opinion, all of that is overblown. They’re in the finals because Luka specifically is having a historic, legendary playoff run</p>

<p>I do agree though they got gafford and Washington, that’s not the best trade deadline ever.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just the trades that turned us around, it was health. We had constant injuries to multiple key rotation players basically at all times the first half of the season. Most importantly, pretty much at least one of Lively, Luka, and Kyrie were always out. That trio didn’t play many games together until post allstar break.</p>

      <label for="l6wqqby" class="commentText"><p>Respectfully, I disagree. Luka didn&rsquo;t even play particularly well during the first round because he was hurt. It goes without saying that Luka has led the team during this runand Kyrie is their second best player, but every champion needs significant contributions from roleplayers and PJ has been key. I think it&rsquo;s the best deadline I&rsquo;ve ever seen from a team and I don&rsquo;t think Dallas is just a hot 5th seed. They won about two thirds of their games after the deadline and I don&rsquo;t think that was solely due to Kyrie playing healthy and Lively developing.</p>

<p>So crazy. 1st half the season for a bunch of us Mavs fans we knew the Mavs were a PF and depth at C away from being dangerous but thought it likely only one of those things would be addressed at the TDL and it would likely take another offseason to get things right. After the trade I was hyped, and shocked reading ESPN grading it a D.</p>

I thought Dallas would beat LA, but I was fairly confident OKC would beat Dallas. My point wasn&rsquo;t that Boston is screwed; Boston has a great, well constructed team. But it&rsquo;s not the case of a 5th seed against a 1 seed Goliath at all.</p>

<p>Luka is also a different player defensively during the playoffs. So is Kyrie. Are they White/Jrue on defense? No. But if you&rsquo;re watching tape from the first few months of the season, you&rsquo;re not really watching this Dallas team.</p>

      <label for="l70eikg" class="commentText"><p>I think we are entering a new age. Not saying Mavs are going to win it all, but 5th seed in the finals this year, an 8th seed last year, a 6th seed in the conference finals this year and a 7th seed last year</p>

<p>4 of the last 8 teams in the conference finals were 5th or lower</p>

<p>One 4th seed in conference finals in 22</p>

<p>A 4th and 5th seed in conference finals in 21</p>

<p>Haven’t looked too much into it, but just seems like a matter of time before one of them wins</p>

      <label for="l70xg6f" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re 100% correct. The continued increase in 3PA is creating a more high variance game.</p>

<p>A team that avg 38% from 3 on 40 total attempts can shoot 15% one night and 65% the next. That&rsquo;s a <strong>60 point</strong> difference.</p>

      <label for="l70j2bo" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;re a weird fifth seed. Obviously every fan should know the narrative by now but they&rsquo;re a completely different team post trade deadline.</p>

<p>A first round exit type core existed with Luka, Kyrie and Lively. But the spark that Gaff and PJ brought in changed this team drastically. The record speaks for itself. If this was the roster from the start I guarantee they&rsquo;re fighting for that one seed with Minny, Denver and OKC. Plus Luka gets more MVP looks.</p>

<p>This was a rare case of a loaded conference meeting a team that hit it&rsquo;s stride at the perfect time.</p>

      <label for="l6xkbkv" class="commentText"><p>This Dallas team is less shocking tho, they played amazing after the midseason moves. The top 3 seeds just had an insurmountable record and the Clippers snuck in at 4 after having an insane 30 game stretch early on. But the Clippers health broke down, the 2-3 seeds wore each other out in 2nd round, and the Mavs dispatched the inexperienced Thunder. Only thing unusual about this year across the board is the complete absence of any real homecourt advantage for any team (Mavs winning 3 of their 4 WCF games on road, Wolves winning 3 of their 4 games in Denver while blowing a 2-0 lead at home, Celtics only 2 losses so far were at home, Mavs vs Clippers/Thunder saw road wins as well for both teams)</p>
