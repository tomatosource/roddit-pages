      <label for="l6wzn6x" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the variance of scoring. In MLB where the average game has 9 runs scored or NHL where the average game has 6 Goals scored, the variance is much higher allowing for a less talented team to steal a win. In the NBA where there are 200+ pts scored, the sample size is so big that the better team can win more often than not.</p>

<p>You see this reflected in the regular season where it&rsquo;s not uncommon for multiple NBA teams to have a Win % of .700+ but even the best teams are only around .620 in the MLB or the NHL where a 60+ win team or even multiple 55+ win teams is extremely rare.</p>

<p>That said, I think this is a sign of things to come for the NBA for two reasons, I think the three point shot creates more of that random volatility from game to game, allowing upsets to happen (Miami last year), and mid-season player movement allows for teams to improve massively mid-season like we&rsquo;re seeing with the Mavs so they&rsquo;re coming into the playoffs &lsquo;underseeded&rsquo;</p>

      <label for="l6x04ex" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s both - the other guy has a point too. In basketball your stars are on the floor most of the game. In hockey that never applies, so the individual influence of a star is diminished. Even if they&rsquo;re dominant every time they&rsquo;re on the ice, they aren&rsquo;t on the ice most of the game</p>

      <label for="l6x3mmz" class="commentText"><p>The variance issue is still more important. Because in Hockey over the course of a season you still get teams that are clearly better than others. In basketball you just happen to see the difference much faster. To put it another way, if Hockey can hypothetically use Bo30 as their playoff series, you would see a lot fewer upsets. This is why the Premier League despite soccer being a very high variance sports tend to have basically the same teams on top each season. Cause there&rsquo;s no playoffs to muck things up.</p>

      <label for="l6x0ytm" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely true too and just another form of the lack of variance. Talent spread across 8-9 rotation players vs. 20+ in the NHL or MLB you&rsquo;ll naturally have less variance in game to game performance and the ability for one or two players&rsquo; impact to show.</p>

<p>Hockey rosters also have goalies that can either be on a heater and steal games or be terrible and it doesn’t matter how good your team is they will let in terrible goals.</p>

<p>Just a lot more team play needed to that in the nba where stars have more impact due to less variable like no goalies and they play way more minutes.</p>

In football, one game playoffs are made for upsets. Baseball is probably the closest to the NBA, but for a polar opposite reason: No one player can really tilt an entire series.</p>

Upsets don’t happen often because the best team gets more chances to show they’re the best team (compared to e.g. football, where a kicker having an off day means your entire season is over)</p>

      <label for="l6wy3wk" class="commentText"><p>Hockey is overall a lower scoring game, which allows for more potential statistical variance and accordingly, more upsets. A lot easier to pull off an upset when there are maybe 6-7 total scores (plenty are way less than that) in a 60 minute game with possession being less concrete. Basketball just on the number of controlled possessions each team has is bound to be the most statistically normal of all the major sports, and when coupled with a best-of-7 format, that just doesnt lend itself to many upsets (as opposed to March Madness where there are plenty because its single-elimination).</p>

      <label for="l6xjcnp" class="commentText"><p>Jason Kidd seems to only care about the post season. The regular season to him is just a way to experiment to see what works and doesn&rsquo;t work for the post season. He will stick with seemingly worse players because he wants to see how he can use everyone&rsquo;s positive side. THJ did see some minutes in the playoffs until he did the inevitable jacking up of bricks with confidence, Kidd put a stop to that and I haven&rsquo;t seen him play since then. Kidd isn&rsquo;t playing with rotations anymore. Since the trade deadline the Mavs have a 75% win percentage in the regular season.</p>

      <label for="l6wpojz" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s so misleading to think of Dallas as a 5th seed. First, the West was tight as a tiger. They were a game behind LA for the fourth seed. More importantly, they had the most successful trade deadline ever and they&rsquo;re a different team with Gafford and PJ. Kyrie also missed some games early on. This is just a completely different team than the one that played during the first half of the season.</p>

The Mavs were incredibly banged up over that stretch and while a lot of the change looks to be attributable to Gafford and PJ, a large part is just that the players they already had got healthy.</p>

<p>In my opinion, all of that is overblown. They’re in the finals because Luka specifically is having a historic, legendary playoff run</p>

<p>It really isn’t, especially for Luka and the efficiency he scores with, this is a 3-4 shot increase a game…Luka has made it a point to give up these shots to PJ in the corner or Gaff and Lively in the dunker spot for easier baskets so what 5ppg for him personally when he’s making it up elsewhere?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>lol… so I guess Jordan’s run isn’t legendary because he was “simply meeting expectations” he had when coming out of college? Lebron’s ring in Cleveland 2016 meant nothing because he was projected to win a championship with them since draft night?</p>

<p>We could apply this to Wemby and I’m willing to bet the house that if you had a higher than room temp iq then you’d carry a different tune. He put up good stats but the Spurs have the same record as last year so he hasn’t quite met expectations, therefore his rookie campaign isn’t that historic.</p>

<p>What would you have to say to that?</p>

It goes without saying that Luka has led the team during this runand Kyrie is their second best player, but every champion needs significant contributions from roleplayers and PJ has been key. I think it&rsquo;s the best deadline I&rsquo;ve ever seen from a team and I don&rsquo;t think Dallas is just a hot 5th seed. They won about two thirds of their games after the deadline and I don&rsquo;t think that was solely due to Kyrie playing healthy and Lively developing.</p>

<p>So crazy. 1st half the season for a bunch of us Mavs fans we knew the Mavs were a PF and depth at C away from being dangerous but thought it likely only one of those things would be addressed at the TDL and it would likely take another offseason to get things right.

      <label for="l6xkbkv" class="commentText"><p>This Dallas team is less shocking tho, they played amazing after the midseason moves. The top 3 seeds just had an insurmountable record and the Clippers snuck in at 4 after having an insane 30 game stretch early on. But the Clippers health broke down, the 2-3 seeds wore each other out in 2nd round, and the Mavs dispatched the inexperienced Thunder. Only thing unusual about this year across the board is the complete absence of any real homecourt advantage for any team (Mavs winning 3 of their 4 WCF games on road, Wolves winning 3 of their 4 games in Denver while blowing a 2-0 lead at home, Celtics only 2 losses so far were at home, Mavs vs Clippers/Thunder saw road wins as well for both teams)</p>

      <label for="l6xkemg" class="commentText"><p>This Mavs roster is also one of the most unorthodox 5 seeds I&rsquo;ve ever seen in 20 years. It&rsquo;s not often a deadline trade solves all your problems aaaand you have two of the most potent offensive players of all time running the show already.</p>
