      <label for="l6wzn6x" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the variance of scoring. In MLB where the average game has 9 runs scored or NHL where the average game has 6 Goals scored, the variance is much higher allowing for a less talented team to steal a win. In the NBA where there are 200+ pts scored, the sample size is so big that the better team can win more often than not.</p>

<p>You see this reflected in the regular season where it&rsquo;s not uncommon for multiple NBA teams to have a Win % of .700+ but even the best teams are only around .620 in the MLB or the NHL where a 60+ win team or even multiple 55+ win teams is extremely rare.</p>

<p>That said, I think this is a sign of things to come for the NBA for two reasons, I think the three point shot creates more of that random volatility from game to game, allowing upsets to happen (Miami last year), and mid-season player movement allows for teams to improve massively mid-season like we&rsquo;re seeing with the Mavs so they&rsquo;re coming into the playoffs &lsquo;underseeded&rsquo;</p>

      <label for="l6x04ex" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s both - the other guy has a point too. In basketball your stars are on the floor most of the game. In hockey that never applies, so the individual influence of a star is diminished. Even if they&rsquo;re dominant every time they&rsquo;re on the ice, they aren&rsquo;t on the ice most of the game</p>

      <label for="l6x0ytm" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely true too and just another form of the lack of variance. Talent spread across 8-9 rotation players vs. 20+ in the NHL or MLB you&rsquo;ll naturally have less variance in game to game performance and the ability for one or two players&rsquo; impact to show.</p>

      <label for="l6x3mmz" class="commentText"><p>The variance issue is still more important. Because in Hockey over the course of a season you still get teams that are clearly better than others. In basketball you just happen to see the difference much faster. To put it another way, if Hockey can hypothetically use Bo30 as their playoff series, you would see a lot fewer upsets. This is why the Premier League despite soccer being a very high variance sports tend to have basically the same teams on top each season. Cause there&rsquo;s no playoffs to muck things up.</p>

<p>Hockey rosters also have goalies that can either be on a heater and steal games or be terrible and it doesn’t matter how good your team is they will let in terrible goals.</p>

<p>Just a lot more team play needed to that in the nba where stars have more impact due to less variable like no goalies and they play way more minutes.</p>

      <label for="l6wy3wk" class="commentText"><p>Hockey is overall a lower scoring game, which allows for more potential statistical variance and accordingly, more upsets. A lot easier to pull off an upset when there are maybe 6-7 total scores (plenty are way less than that) in a 60 minute game with possession being less concrete. Basketball just on the number of controlled possessions each team has is bound to be the most statistically normal of all the major sports, and when coupled with a best-of-7 format, that just doesnt lend itself to many upsets (as opposed to March Madness where there are plenty because its single-elimination).</p>

      <label for="l6wpojz" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s so misleading to think of Dallas as a 5th seed. First, the West was tight as a tiger. They were a game behind LA for the fourth seed. More importantly, they had the most successful trade deadline ever and they&rsquo;re a different team with Gafford and PJ. Kyrie also missed some games early on. This is just a completely different team than the one that played during the first half of the season.</p>

      <label for="l6x2fjp" class="commentText"><p>I’m not manufacturing grievances, just calling a spade a spade… if any other player in the league put up that line AND managed to get their team to a Conference Final then we’d be talking about how in control of all aspects of they are and how legendary it is.</p>

<p>Is the expectation for him to break scoring records or to win? To sit here and say that his run of beating the 4,1,3 seeds isn’t historic or legendary because he’s 5 ppg short is weird and I think people downplaying are the ones lying.</p>

<p>Is the bar for &ldquo;historic, legendary&rdquo; runs simply meeting expectations?</p>

      <label for="l6wyd1m" class="commentText"><p>Luka playmaking was still there, even if he was shooting poor (especially from 3).</p>

<p>Just having a guy who can basically neutralize most of the defense other teams try to limit him (and his team), it&rsquo;s a big plus.</p>

      <label for="l6wwhdj" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, Luka is just being Luka (minus game 5, that game from him was ridiculous), in fact he was playing below average up until the last 2 games of the OKC series.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just the trades that turned us around, it was health. We had constant injuries to multiple key rotation players basically at all times the first half of the season. Most importantly, pretty much at least one of Lively, Luka, and Kyrie were always out. That trio didn’t play many games together until post allstar break.</p>

      <label for="l6wqqby" class="commentText"><p>Respectfully, I disagree. Luka didn&rsquo;t even play particularly well during the first round because he was hurt. It goes without saying that Luka has led the team during this runand Kyrie is their second best player, but every champion needs significant contributions from roleplayers and PJ has been key. I think it&rsquo;s the best deadline I&rsquo;ve ever seen from a team and I don&rsquo;t think Dallas is just a hot 5th seed. They won about two thirds of their games after the deadline and I don&rsquo;t think that was solely due to Kyrie playing healthy and Lively developing.</p>

What makes them different from the other two?<br>
It would not be their first championship.<br>
Is it that they didn&rsquo;t win last year? That&rsquo;s oddly specific.</p>
