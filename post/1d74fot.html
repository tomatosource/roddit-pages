      <label for="l6wy3wk" class="commentText"><p>Hockey is overall a lower scoring game, which allows for more potential statistical variance and accordingly, more upsets. A lot easier to pull off an upset when there are maybe 6-7 total scores (plenty are way less than that) in a 60 minute game with possession being less concrete. Basketball just on the number of controlled possessions each team has is bound to be the most statistically normal of all the major sports, and when coupled with a best-of-7 format, that just doesnt lend itself to many upsets (as opposed to March Madness where there are plenty because its single-elimination).</p>

      <label for="l6wpojz" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s so misleading to think of Dallas as a 5th seed. First, the West was tight as a tiger. They were a game behind LA for the fourth seed. More importantly, they had the most successful trade deadline ever and they&rsquo;re a different team with Gafford and PJ. Kyrie also missed some games early on. This is just a completely different team than the one that played during the first half of the season.</p>

      <label for="l6wq9m7" class="commentText"><p>The West is tight every single year, and PJ and Gafford are role players- it’s not like they traded for KD. Teams make big deadline moves every year. They also weren’t unhealthy relative to other teams.</p>

<p>In my opinion, all of that is overblown. They’re in the finals because Luka specifically is having a historic, legendary playoff run</p>

      <label for="l6wwhdj" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, Luka is just being Luka (minus game 5, that game from him was ridiculous), in fact he was playing below average up until the last 2 games of the OKC series.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just the trades that turned us around, it was health. We had constant injuries to multiple key rotation players basically at all times the first half of the season. Most importantly, pretty much at least one of Lively, Luka, and Kyrie were always out. That trio didn’t play many games together until post allstar break.</p>

      <label for="l6wqqby" class="commentText"><p>Respectfully, I disagree. Luka didn&rsquo;t even play particularly well during the first round because he was hurt. It goes without saying that Luka has led the team during this runand Kyrie is their second best player, but every champion needs significant contributions from roleplayers and PJ has been key. I think it&rsquo;s the best deadline I&rsquo;ve ever seen from a team and I don&rsquo;t think Dallas is just a hot 5th seed. They won about two thirds of their games after the deadline and I don&rsquo;t think that was solely due to Kyrie playing healthy and Lively developing.</p>
