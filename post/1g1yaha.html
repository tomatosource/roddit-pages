      <label for="lrk278r" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s kinda hilarious that everyone was saying he was going to be an instant &lsquo;microwave scorer&rsquo; but had uncertain playmaking skills and yet so far during summer league &amp; preseason it&rsquo;s been the exact opposite.

      <label for="lrl0ui5" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re right, but I feel like that might be a function of him having a tougher time cleanly getting his shot off when faced with bigger and faster defenders, and also having targets that are way more likely to be able to capitalize on his passes.</p>

<p>Basically, I think he might still be a microwave scorer by the time he&rsquo;s got a year of experience under his belt.</p>

<p>I also think Dillingham&rsquo;s offense should take a lot of pressure off of Ant offensively which helps.</p>

      <label for="lrkd6kl" class="commentText"><p>Yeah no need to wonder. People who are hyping him up are conveniently not talking about it for a reason. He&rsquo;s going to be dreadful on that end. It is the singular reason he was available at pick eight despite everything else, and the fact that the Spurs a team desperately needing a young guard prospect had no attention of taking him before the wolves called.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s going to have to be an absolute offensive monster to ever be capable of being a top three or so player on a true contender. Whether it&rsquo;s been summer league or preseason, he already gets targeted regularly.</p>

<p>In His defense I&rsquo;ll say this, he appears to be more locked in than he was often in college. He simply is tiny&hellip; And doesn&rsquo;t appear to have the ability to put on a whole lot of mass, his overall defensive awareness isn&rsquo;t amazing either</p>

      <label for="lrkhpl0" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re right he&rsquo;ll never be big, but I think your ceiling for him is a little harsh. Mike Conley came into the league 2 kilos less than him and considerably shorter and he made an all defensive team one year. Yeah, I&rsquo;d bet he never makes all defense and probably won&rsquo;t ever be a plus defender, but it&rsquo;s possible he becomes a passable steal artist.</p>

      <label for="lrkk6b0" class="commentText"><p>As far as steals, yeah I think he has a possibility with that. He even had moments at Kentucky where he was solid. And we could definitely try to picture like top 1% outcomes for him where everything breaks perfect and those definitely exist And in that scenario, he puts on every single pound of muscle. His frame can handle, goes from being a genuinely terrible situational defender, to a Mike Conley like master of team defense, And is able to become a average to slightly below average defender</p>

<p>I just think finding guards, particularly in the modern game were mismatches are literally the name of the game in the playoffs, with his combination of small height, lightweight, tiny frame, and a mediocre wingspan who became even passable Defenders is&hellip; Very very very uncommon. And again, if he was just someone with bad physical measurements but good mental defensive makeup, like his former teammate Reed Shepherd, I&rsquo;d be a bit more optimistic on his outcome in that regard.</p>

<p>But he has a long long long ways to go on the mental side too. The deck It&rsquo;s just massively stacked against him</p>

<p>The wolves took that shot because frankly&hellip; They need to swing for the fences. That team is massively expensive, has very few draft assets To make trades or for internal development over the next few years, and is going to have a lot of their best pieces on their way out by the time Edwards hits his Prime. Their time to witness now, but they also need to get creative if they want to keep that window open long-term, even if Edwards does reach his full potential and becomes an MVP.</p>

<p>Dillingham&rsquo;s offensive ceiling Is awesome and definitely something that could really shoot the wolves to the next level if it pops at its absolute Best case scenario</p>

<p>But I think people already trying to clown on the league for letting him drop to eight, or the Spurs trading That pic, are massively underestimating the challenge ahead for both him and the wolves in regards to him becoming The type of player who&rsquo;s not going to be relentlessly played off the floor in games that matter. And again, that&rsquo;s in the best case scenario if his offense absolutely does become as good as it can be</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be a big Debbie Downer with him. I liked dillingham. I didn&rsquo;t think the Spurs were going to draft him so in the brief moment where it looked like they did, I was shocked, because they super super value size and positional flexibility, but I did really like the idea of him and Victor Being a dynamic one-two punch in the pick and roll. And I think he&rsquo;s going to be a really fun player next to Edwards</p>

<p>But this was a genuine gamble by the wolves.</p>

<p>They kind of.. Really need him to hit. And again in their defense, there really is a sleeping monster in there. Offensively at least. And while I definitely don&rsquo;t think his offense will get quite nuclear enough for him to be the second best player on a championship team with his defense as projected, I do think he&rsquo;s probably going to become a very useful and dynamic offensive player for a long time</p>

<p>His development and how the wolves choose to use him Will be a fascinating thing to follow over the next 2 or 3 years</p>

      <label for="lrko02x" class="commentText"><p>Ah, yeah I see where you&rsquo;re coming from. I wasn&rsquo;t really thinking about the Spurs haha, but all that makes sense. Dillingham is terrible defensively currently and only has very limited upside in that department, no doubt. As you say, it&rsquo;s a gamble there. It makes a lot more sense for the Wolves to take on that sort of gamble since we have a lot of defense already to help cover his deficiencies in exchange for that offensive firepower.</p>

      <label for="lrkp9c3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah exactly. I think if there was a team that could really justify gambling on dillingham, it&rsquo;s the wolves. I think in theory he&rsquo;s actually a pretty interesting fit with them. I think what they gave up considering how little draft assets they have was substantial, but those are the kind of moves you have to make. Sometimes when you&rsquo;re a small market team that&rsquo;s never going to have high quality players just fall into your lap. Lap. You have to turn over every stone and try to find unexpected places to unEarth stars and high-level contributors</p>

<p>All in all, this is one of those rare trades that makes a lot of sense for both teams. The only way it ends up blowing up for the Spurs as of dillingham hits his absolute Apex and becomes a true top 20 player caliber star, and the only way it blows up for the wolves is if dillingham doesn&rsquo;t establish himself as a high-end rotation player or starter. I think both teams feel solid about it As of right now</p>

Conley performed amazing for them but is just a little too old to maintain form, Kyle Anderson was phenomenal too but it was hard to overlap his minutes with their best players (edwards, McDaniels, towns, and gobert) for various reasons. When they picked up monte Morris i thought that was truly the missing piece and he looked great for them imo but for whatever reason didn&rsquo;t get as much playing time as I expected.</p>

<p>The one player I coveted for them more than any other was tyus Jones. He fit perfectly and seemed attainable. Anyway, my question is basically in your opinion do you agree with all of that assessment and tyus Jones would&rsquo;ve made as big an impact as I believe he would&rsquo;ve. And as a followup, if you do agree, do you think tyus&rsquo; defense is better than Dillingham? I don&rsquo;t think it is and in fact I think they are identical players in terms of skillets, which is why I&rsquo;m SO high on the Dillingham pickup. Anyway, sorry for the rambling, appreciate your response.</p>

      <label for="lrkhd5q" class="commentText"><p>I’ve said in another comment but he legit projects as the single worst individual defender in the league rn. 6’1” height, 6’3” wingspan, 164 lb is basically rookie Trae Young size. any average NBA player is going to cook him and he’s gonna be a target every second he’s out there</p>

<p>he needs a year in a pro-level strength and conditioning program before he’ll have a meaningful role in the rotation IMO.</p>

      <label for="lrl3rnu" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re not wrong.  I&rsquo;ve been very puzzled by blowing that future pick on this move specifically.</p>

<p>But I will say he has been significantly more dynamic to watch with the ball than I expected.  Despite the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t really show a current proclivity to finish at the hoop it does give me some hope for him.</p>

<p>But for real, his man can cut hard to the basket and feast pretty regularly.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be that easy to hide him on anyone.  And our PGs after Conley are all not true points.  I think it could be a real issue this season, whether Dilly sees big minutes or we use other options as backup point.</p>

      <label for="lrlxe3t" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it seems like a move geared towards letting Conley help develop the point guard of the future.</p>

<p>I’ve watched all their pre-season/summer league games, and Dillingham definitely appears to be at least trying to hustle on defense. IMO, it’s all gonna come down to how much weight he can put on over the course of the next few years. Small guards can become passable on defense if they are sturdy, and it would help a ton with his scoring as well.</p>

      <label for="lrkdpxc" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;ll probably end up like that. I don&rsquo;t think dillingham is going to become a star in the traditional sense because I frankly think he&rsquo;s going to be dreadful on defense and never a true mega outlier on offense To make up for it. I Do you think he&rsquo;s going to be a useful piece for a wolves team that can cover for him enough to allow him to become an important part of their rotation And be a solid compliment for Edwards.</p>

<p>Other side the Spurs Not only got two trade assets from a team far enough down the road where it could be genuinely valuable when constructing a trade in the next year or two, they also used at the space they got from trading the pic To take Harrison Barnes on and get that unprotected sacramentonKing&rsquo;s pick swap</p>

<p>Trading A mid lottery pick in what&rsquo;s considered a mediocre draft for an unprotected pic and two unprotected pick swaps from teams who at the time in which they convey will likely have the majority of their core players no longer under contract, is a really solid move.</p>
