      <label for="lcrw24k" class="commentText"><p>“When the the <span class="math inline">\(2 billion home of the Los Angeles Clippers, Intuit Dome, opens next month with a concert by Bruno Mars, visitors to the 18,000-seat arena will not only be greeted by an enormous double-sided LED scoreboard, an outdoor community basketball court and food choices ranging from vegan cauliflower wraps to dulce de leche churros.
They will also encounter about \)</span>11 million worth of ambitious, immense and site-specific artworks that have been commissioned from seven artists with Los Angeles connections.
Sculpture, murals and digital art installations by artists including Refik Anadol, Jennifer Steinkamp, Charles Gaines and Glenn Kaino will be on view throughout the campus of the privately funded new home of the N.B.A.’s Clippers.
The artists involved said they liked the idea of reaching people outside a conventional context. “l believe art should be for anyone and anywhere,” said Anadol, whose A.I.-driven digital artwork, “Living Arena,” is displayed on an LED screen 40 feet tall by 70 feet wide. “Museums and galleries are so last century. I don’t think there are any more borders“
“The Intuit Dome is the latest sports arena or stadium to embrace art with its hot dogs and beer, a move intended in part to make the spaces more appealing as rental venues when the resident teams aren’t playing. SoFi Stadium, also in Inglewood, which is home to the N.F.L.’s Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, last year presented a pair of exhibitions focused on African-American art and history. Other stadiums that prominently feature art include AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where the Dallas Cowboys and Anish Kapoor’s “Sky Mirror” reside, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, home to the Atlanta Falcons and a more than 73,000-pound avian sculpture by Gabor Miklos Szoke called “Rise Up.”
The Clippers say the art program — which includes another 40-plus pieces, budgeted at an additional approximately $3 million — represents an effort to connect with Los Angeles and support the city’s artists.
“We talked extensively with the community about what really mattered to them, and public art was something that we really wanted to have more of,” said Gillian Zucker, the chief executive of Halo Sports and Entertainment, the Clippers’ parent company, on a recent walk through the stadium.
“This is a global opportunity to really showcase artists,” she added. “That’s a big part of the spirit of this building — looking at the community around us.”
The Los Angeles art world has welcomed the effort. “Some of the most moving experiences people have with art are when they don’t expect to see it,” said Johanna Burton, the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art. “When you run into art in the world, there is a different kind of reaction that’s possible

This isn’t a movement. It’s a stadium. A temple to mass consumerism. Its first event is a Bruno Mars concert. They have a wall of high school jerseys, many, many toilets and the churros got mentioned before the art.</p>

      <label for="lcs5c81" class="commentText"><p>My bad that was postseason stats.  So I assume you hate the other 8 players ahead of him more, because they’re even less fun to watch?  And then you also probably hate watching the next 6 players who are also within 1 FTA of him?</p>

<p>The hate AD gets is so weird.  He’s a big, powerful player who operates almost solely around the basket and draws a lot of physical contact on practically every shot.  He also plays a lot of minutes and has a high usage rate.  Of course he’s going to shoot FTs</p>
