</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In the 2000-2001 season, Jerry Stackhouse averaged 29.8 ppg. The next season, from 2001-2002, he averaged 21.3 seasons and came 4th in MIP voting. Although he didn&rsquo;t earn that many points in the voting process, it&rsquo;s still very interesting to see any player receive significant placement within MIP voting after their PPG drops by 8 pts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how accurate this is, because of just how unlikely this situation is. I tried to search for other sources to corroborate this, in case this was a bug in Basketball Reference, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything. In this aspect, feedback would be highly appreciated.</p>

      <label for="ld5c2e1" class="commentText"><p>Narrative.</p>

<p>The Pistons were the surprise team of the year, a group of rag-taggers who were picked to finish 14th in the East but instead came out and won the division. Media was looking for the catalyst for such a turnaround, especially considering the team didn&rsquo;t have a singular superstar. A few reasons stuck:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The emergence of a nobody named Ben Wallace</p></li>

<li><p>The Alternators (group of random reserves led by the likes of Jon Barry, Corliss Williamson, Damon Jones, and Zeljko Rebraca</p></li>

<li><p>First time head coach Rick Carlise convincing his team to play as a defense-first cohesive unit</p></li>

<li><p>Jerry Stackhouse buying into the new system and sacrificing his previous identity (shoot all the shots, do nothing else) for the sake of the team. Jerry&rsquo;s shooting efficiency didn&rsquo;t really change from one season to the next, but people did notice that his approach to the game did. He appeared to buy into the team concept, traded shots for cohesion, began putting forth effort on the defensive side of the ball, and still stood in as the guy who&rsquo;d take the big shot when needed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine a few of his MIP votes were people more or less saying, &ldquo;See? It pays to be a complete player instead of a shot-jacker. We see you, buddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And truthfully, a lot of Pistons fans recognized the shift as well. His stock felt high enough after that season that when he was dealt for Rip Hamilton, I remember thinking, &ldquo;Aw man, that&rsquo;s all we got for Stack?!&rdquo;</p>

Milwaukee and Toronto were ahead of them in the Central (both teams cratered the final 2 months) whereas Detroit stayed hot.</p>

<p>Also, the Pistons best player that season wasn&rsquo;t Stack but Ben Wallace and the league was just starting to realize how good he was defensively (he made the All-Star game the following year).</p>

      <label for="ld5dh55" class="commentText"><p>Aside from Stack, they were all a bunch of relative unknowns. Ben Wallace had proven himself to be an all-star level player but he came into the season with zero name recognition and people weren&rsquo;t necessarily sure what to do with a guy who couldn&rsquo;t score but grabbed all the rebounds and blocked all the shots. Also, he didn&rsquo;t go fully nuts until after the all-star break (averaged close to 15 rebounds and 4 blocks over the last half of the season).</p>

<p>Also, as another poster said, the Pistons were a surprising team but division champs wasn&rsquo;t exactly a foregone conclusion at the break. And, unfortunately for Stack, he found out that shooting less and winning more, at that point, wasn&rsquo;t going to reap the same indivisual rewards as firing at will like he did a year prior. Perhaps the MIP votes were recognition of his sacrifice, as he swapped volume shooting for a more well rounded contribution that aided in the significant improvement of his team.</p>

      <label for="ld4ss34" class="commentText"><p>I love the 2002 Pistons but I can say I had no recollection of Stack receiving MIP votes that year. I might be able to help a bit with the narrative that may have propelled such a result though.</p>

<p>The Pistons were expected to be basement dwellers in 2001-02. Sports Illustrated picked them to finish 14th in the East; the vibe was pretty similar to the current Pistons, except that team&rsquo;s young talent was Rodney White and Brian Cardinal.</p>

<p>The only player on that team who had any real semblance of national recognition up to that point was Jerry Stackhouse. Unfortunately, Stack was coming off of an all-time shot jacking season where he averaged nearly 30 points per game while barely shooting 40 percent from the field for a team that won 32 games. He looked like the quintessential &ldquo;everything that&rsquo;s wrong with modern basketball&rdquo; guy, just out there isolated and jacking until his heart&rsquo;s content with no concern for anything else.</p>

<p>The tide (and narrative) turned in 2001-02, however. I had no idea who our new coach was—some rando named Rick Carlisle—but he was able to piece together a more well-balanced system that&rsquo;d only have a chance of success if Stackhouse agreed to drastically alter his approach to the game. Basically:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shoot less</p></li>

<li><p>Pass more</p></li>

<li><p>Play defense</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Seems simple, but for a guy whose entire identity and relevancy stemmed for shooting at will, change wasn&rsquo;t a foregone conclusion. And truth be told, if you Basketball Reference that guy, most of his box score stats will appear similar <em>except</em> for a seven-shot reduction in field goal attempts and subsequently, a lower scoring average.</p>

<p>However, picking his spots, acknowledging that other elements of the game existed, and spreading the wealth played a significant role in the Pistons rising from basement dweller to 50-32 and a Central Division. They were the surprise of the season and reaped the rewards:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Defensive Player of the Year: Ben Wallace (who was previously an unknown)</p></li>

<li><p>Coach of the Year: Rick Carlisle</p></li>

<li><p>Sixth Man of the Year: Corliss Williamson</p></li>

<li><p>Most Improved Player: Runner-Up - Ben Wallace; Fourth Place - Jerry Stackhouse</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The Pistons were supposed to be terrible, they won the division instead. Stackhouse changed his game and that played a significant role in the turnaround. Media and others latched onto that narrative and it impacted awards voting.</p>

      <label for="ld4jer6" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to understand. His numbers were worse than the season before across the board save a slight increase in assists and rebounds and a slight decrease in turnovers (but given his reduction in shots and his statistically insignificant increase in assists, his turnovers should have dropped more.</p>

<p>I think the change was in his approach to the game. He was playing more off ball and wasn&rsquo;t demanding the ball. The team, in part due to increased roles from other players, saw a nearly 20-game improvement, flipping their lottery record from 32-50 to a 50-32 season. That likely had something to do with it. Likely a narrative like &ldquo;He&rsquo;s finally playing the right way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember that narrative floating around mind you, and I&rsquo;m a Detroit fan. I was just dumbfounded that Dumars was able to fleece Rip Hamilton from Washington for Stackhouse. And we got Hubert Davis and Bobbie Simmons (who was promptly waived only to go on and win MIP himself).</p>

<p>I think Jordan, who has clearly proven that he is no GM, thought Stackhouse was a good scorer because of his PPG averages, and back then, people looked more at PPG and less at percentages.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I said Philly was doomed with two inefficient chuckers like Iverson and Stackshouse, and people were like &ldquo;They are going to become the best back court in NBA history.&rdquo; And there were rumours of Iverson being a problem because he couldn&rsquo;t share the ball or didn&rsquo;t want to share the ball with Stackhouse.</p>

<p>I was just like: Trade them both.</p>
