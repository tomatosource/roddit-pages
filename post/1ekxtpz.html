<p>Don’t like the off-season the Nuggets had. They didn’t replace KCP, unless Braun miraculously takes a jump. Russ and Saric will help their bench some but it’s still a weakness just like last year.</p>

<p>OKC and Dallas both got better for sure in the offseason, and Minnesota will be better too as Ant matures.</p>

      <label for="lgobc5k" class="commentText"><p>Reggie is good for a couple of shots no doubt. But dam he cant run a bench unit to save hos life.</p>

<p>I think the logic is that Jokic and Jamal both want another playmaker alongside them and Russ provides that.</p>

<p>Dunno how good hes actually gonna be in that role, but he is probably the best playmaker for the money.</p>

<p>I so worry about the Jamal fit and if he can do well with Jokic, but it cant be as bad as Reggie being a worse copy of Jamal that cant play the pick and roll with Jokic.</p>

<p>The shooting though will be desperate, but with luck the young guys could take a step forward and become good shooters (Strawther has the best shot at that, though Watson did show promise for a part of the season with hos mid range game).</p>

<p>Its gonna be a wait and seet hing, but its kinda exciting.</p>

      <label for="lgoozds" class="commentText"><p>Even if Braun miraculously subsumes all of KCP’s role flawlessly (unlikely, imo), they still need someone to fill Braun’s bench role. Maybe someone like Strawther can do it, but now you’re counting on 2 decent sized “ifs” just to get back to the quality of the top 6 last year. There are chances for internal development or good performances from less-heralded guys, but it feels like their bench is entirely “ifs” or iffy fits.</p>

<p>And one thing I’m not seeing people mention as much as a point of concern is fatigue. It was glaringly apparent that they were absolutely running on fumes by the end of their playoff run this past year, in large part because of their championship run the year before. But what people aren’t considering is that their stars are not really getting much more rest (if any) this offseason.</p>

<p>While not going as far this year, they still played 5 draining games against the Lakers and then a war of a series against the Wolves (the Wolves looked gassed in the WCF). And now their two best players (the ones who showed the most fatigue in the playoffs) are playing in the Olympics, far deeper into the summer than even their championship run last year. Jokic’s role is huge for Serbia, and Murray still looks hobbled while playing for Canada.</p>

<p>And this now marks 2 straight seasons of very intense postseason workloads. While Saric and Westbrook may allow for 2-3 fewer minutes per game for both Jokic and Murray, they’re likely going to have to push pretty hard given the competitiveness in the West. And both Jokic and Murray are getting older. They’re not “old” by any stretch, but they’re going to be 30 and 28 respectively by the time the playoffs roll around. That’s usually the point in a player’s career where pacing yourself becomes more important.</p>

<p>Denver’s still dangerous as hell, but I don’t quite get why some people are still calling them the favorites in the West.</p>

      <label for="lgpuej6" class="commentText"><p>So much of the Nuggets this year is gonna depend on Jamal Murray. I mean, what is going on with him lately? He was pretty bad in the playoffs and looks downright awful in the Olympics. Is he nursing an injury that nobody knows about? Is he out of shape and just isn&rsquo;t motivated anymore after winning a title? Or is this just temporary and he&rsquo;ll be great this year?</p>

<p>If Murray looks even close to this bad this year, then Denver is in deep shit after losing Bruce Brown, KCP and Reggie Jackson in the last 14 months or so. They need the guards they still have to play great and stay healthy. We saw what the Nuggets looked like before they got Brown and KCP and back when Murray was injured and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t contender-level status. Jokic is amazing, but he can only do so much.</p>

      <label for="lgo1v2k" class="commentText"><p>Can&rsquo;t read the article as i&rsquo;m not subbed to the NYT.</p>

<p>Few questionmarks of note to me that have me worrying about the team</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The obvious one is can Murray get back to his form from 2022-2023 or are these injury issues just part of who he is now. If he can return to his old form we can compete, if not things get rougher unless a TON of other things happen instead.</p></li>

<li><p>How will Westbrook do running the second unit. I tried to buy into the Big Govt experience but he regularly went far too me first and wasn&rsquo;t generating team offense. The second unit&rsquo;s offense in general was not the best but he also hampered it with some very frustrating shot choices.</p></li>

<li><p>How big a leap can the younger guys make. Braun is a huge talking point as he&rsquo;s the most likely to replace KCP in the starting lineup. But we&rsquo;ve also got Watson who fell out of the playoff rotation (I assume due to inconsistent offense against the best defense in the NBA) and Strawther who fell out of the rotation due to injury but showed promise on offense including a fantastic floater game. If at least two of these three take a sigifnificant step and stay healthy this helps a lot, but is not guaranteed.</p></li>

<li><p>A much smaller note than the others, but who will Vlatko be after missing all of last season with injury? If he can be a consistent bench piece that takes a lot of pressure off everyone else, but after missing a season and not exactly lighting the world on fire before this does not feel terribly likely.</p></li>

<p>But we&rsquo;ve also got Watson who fell out of the playoff rotation (I assume due to inconsistent offense against the best defense in the NBA)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watson was also a complete non-factor against the Lakers though. Lebron must have been ecstatic when he checked in for Aaron Gordon because Watson doesn&rsquo;t really have any offensive skills.  If he can&rsquo;t hit wide open 3&rsquo;s, he will never see any meaningful minutes in his career.</p>

      <label for="lgogtfn" class="commentText"><p>Watson had flashes of being decent from 3. He started the season awful, then hit 50% I think it was on 3 attempts a game or something like that (not high volume but he doesn&rsquo;t need high volume, he just needs to be good enough you have to fear sagging off him in the corner so his 3 is respected preventing teams from clogging the paint, along with his athletic ability to attack the rim).</p>

<p>Outside reps to get smarter his defense already shows incredible signs. His 3 ball is certainly the big question mark that needs answering. If he gets better at that one thing his value to the team skyrockets. But we&rsquo;ll see if he gets there.</p>

      <label for="lgpdz79" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s certainly a massive swing skill for him, but there&rsquo;s definitely a world where Peyton is so good at defense (he&rsquo;s already very above average at it) and improves his inside scoring enough to be a very valuable piece without it.</p>

<p>His touch from midrange is very interesting (also has very good % though on minuscule volume), and he&rsquo;s athletic enough to become at least a decent finisher</p>

      <label for="lgp6db7" class="commentText"><p>Tyus Jones excels at distribution, but doesn&rsquo;t really score super well imo, and doesn&rsquo;t play defense well enough. His biggest strength overlaps with one of Jokic&rsquo;s greatest strengths. Yes, Russ also is a facilitator and doesn&rsquo;t space the floor, but he&rsquo;s able to play better defense that Jones (at least when I was watching him sporadically last year he seemed better than before), and at the very least, he&rsquo;s got a few inches on him.</p>

<p>Plus, he&rsquo;s going to play more minutes with the Suns, while probably getting better stats as he has three great scorers to distribute to. I&rsquo;m sure he wants to pad his stats to get a big contract next year.</p>

It was too late into the season when they finally had time together. It stands to reason that him playing more off ball and having more time with a second unit including Grayson and Morris or Tyus is actually a good indication it will be a better season for not only him but the suns in general</p>

<p>7, 12, 42, 32 </p>

<p>21-22 is when he had wrist surgery and he probably wasn&rsquo;t fully recovered/conditioned for 22-23 (and may have been shut down for the last 10 games to tank). It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s had 5 seasons of chronic injuries that are very likely to recur or flare up.</p>

<p>A playoff series in which he still lead his team in scoring and efficiency during a pivotal game 7?</p>

<p>Nobody said it would be a rapid decline but he’s also a guy who’s reliant on becoming a superstar in the playoffs. That isn’t sustainable</p>

      <label for="lgo4wrl" class="commentText"><p>He tore his ACL, came back and averaged 30 with great efficiency in one playoff run, then 20 on poor efficiency the next.  Both regular seasons he was about the same.</p>

<p>He’s obviously not a superstar but that’s on you if you were expecting to be.  He’s a borderline all star and with that comes some inconsistency.  Theres no reason to think we won’t have more of the same next year.</p>

      <label for="lgqk47q" class="commentText"><p>Ok but also what’s more likely?</p>

<p>2020 and 2023 playoffs Murray is the real playoff Murray, and Jamal Murray is the single greatest playoff overperformer in league history by a mile, or</p>

<p>The real playoff Jamal Murray is somewhere between his <sup>2020</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> playoff self and what he did last year, and probably just the same sub-All-Star guy he is in the regular season every year</p>

<p>I think the latter is most likely, and I don’t know if the Nuggets win another title if Jamal Murray is just regular Jamal Murray and not Steph 2.0 in the playoffs</p>

<p>But after watching jokic play so aggressive in the olympics i wouldnt be surprised if we see his greatest season this year. Hes obviously playing with a chip in his shoulder after his team gave up on him against the timberwolves. Im expecting more techs but also more dominance every week, especially with maddog westbrook joining the crew. Going to see some eastern european mafia violence this season.</p>

      <label for="lgphjq0" class="commentText"><p>The Nuggets will be fine.</p>

<p>Braun should be able to cover the starting SG production lost when KCP got paid he has excellent defense and should easily add 10 ppg in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I’m happy for KCP and agree with the FO decision to not match, the Nuggets have to prioritize keeping Gordon and retaining KCP puts that in serious jeopardy long term.</p>

<p>Westbrook is an upgrade over Reggie Jackson especially as a facilitator which is what the Nuggets bench needed most.</p>

<p>By allowing Westbrook to run the second unit; it enables MPJ to be the starter that staggers with the bench in the non-Jokic minutes rather than Murray; giving the bench a featured scorer/shooter for Westbrook to facilitate for.</p>

<p>Saric is an upgrade over no playable back up Big.</p>

<p>A bench unit of Westbrook/Strawther/MPJ/Watson/Saric when Jokic leaves the game should work fine with a good mix of playmaking shooting and defense with good spacing.</p>

<p>Fatigue is my primary concern, not roster construction; and that concern is real.</p>

<p>I can’t wait for the games to begin so all these comments presuming the downfall of the Nuggets can be seen as greatly exaggerated.</p>

      <label for="lgpraz2" class="commentText"><p>forcing jokic to carry the whole season and then playoffs is probably too much to get a championship or make finals.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t see why Gordon couldn&rsquo;t be leaned on a bit more, he can do it all, he doesn&rsquo;t need to take the most diminished role, he&rsquo;s also shown he can bring it up and pass.</p>

<p>But the perimeter defence needs to be really good to offest the lack of rim protection, so losing KCP hurts.</p>

<p>I don’t think they have the pieces to win a title this year even if Murray is at 100%. They have 4 guys on the roster you can trust in a playoff rotation. And if Murray is at 100%, they’ll basically have to give him the max extension next offseason, which he isn’t worth, and then their cap situation is cooked forever.</p>

<p>If Murray isn’t good this year, they’ll still make the playoffs and bow out in round 1 or 2, but then their cap situation opens up next offseason and they can go after some big fish role players + they might be able to get Murray to sign a contract closer to his real value, and then they’re set up for a 2-3 year title window from 2026 to 2029</p>

<p>If they somehow manage to make the finals again, there are Eastern teams that will give them major problems on the wing defensively.  I don’t think there’s anyone in their starting lineup that you can really call a plus defender. Maybe Murray, at times.</p>

      <label for="lgodbyh" class="commentText"><p>Easily lower half of the top 8. Might drop to play ins. The Grizzlies are presumably getting a healthy Ja. The Thunder only got stronger, etc. lots of compeition.</p>

<p>Jokic is going to be tired after this Olympics. Murray is going to be injured in the regular season as usual. MPJ is going to continue to be a massive Jokic assist merchant. MPJ is basically useless without Jokic on the floor and no, he&rsquo;s not going to take a leap at this point in his career. They have an even weaker bench. KCP and his vet leadership is gone. KCP was a great locker room guy. The Nuggets aren&rsquo;t only losing a starting caliber defensive guard.</p>

<p>Jokic should demand a trade or he&rsquo;s going to waste his generational talent. He has given this pathetic franchise a title already. His job is done.</p>

<p>My hopium is, they were 12th ranked defense last year while giving up 18ppg off TOs(5th most). If the two guys we got, who fight to lead the league in ast/to ratio every season can at the very minimum cut that by 2ppg(though I imagine more.) that would put Suns as a top 6 defense.</p>

<p>But this is why I believe them to be the same tier.</p>

<p>Tyus and Morris absolutely help the turnovers, and Plumlee is far better than Eubanks, even if Plumlee isn’t good. So those are things that help the defense immensely without even being thought of as defense.</p>

      <label for="lgorpxz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah see the issue is that their impact isnt gonna be that huge. For the 2nd chance point, you are still gonna be one of the smaller teams in the league given who you are starting.</p>

<p>Like you said, Plumlee isnt good.</p>

<p>You still have weak perimeter and interior defense, with no real elite defender to speak of and now a coach that is more focused on offense than defense (remember that defensive schemes are more important than actual individual defenders).</p>

<p>And you will always have turnover issues with an iso heavy playstyle, given that you are still gonna have Beal, Booker and Durant all out there.</p>

<p>Of course it could improve, but turnovers were never the reason the Suns werent a great defense as seen with the Timberwolves also having insane turnover issues and still being the best defense in the league.</p>

<p>Its a squad built with offense in mind, so better to have the guys focus on offense than defense. Othserwise you are gonna be mediocre in both.</p>

I do think the Suns got better and Nuggets got worse, but neither by enough to say they’re on the same level, close though.</p>
