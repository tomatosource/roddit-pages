Just beat Kawhi and Giannis in back to back games, guarding both and scoring on both late, AND Giannis got hurt that game. Lakers were like 2 games back from the Bucks for the overall 1 seed. Led the league in assists at 10 a game, still gave you 27 a night, best defense in the league, never lost if they had a lead after the 3rd quarter&hellip; like, yeah, there would have been no question about it if we weren&rsquo;t robbed of the last 6 weeks of that season.</p>

<p>If you wanna talk crazy, then MJ was stacking MVP&rsquo;s in his thirties. Lebron&rsquo;s last MVP was at 28.</p>

<p>And even crazier is that MJ won MVP in his last season. He for sure would have won 2 or even more had he kept going.</p>

      <label for="ln5umul" class="commentText"><p>If you want some easy evidence then look at LeBron&rsquo;s regular season numbers, advanced stats, on/off numbers and team record in the regular season during the second half of his career. There&rsquo;s a very clear drop off. But those numbers go right back up in the playoffs, and his teams way overpoerformed their regular season records.</p>

<p>In the first Cleveland stint LeBron was going 100% the whole season. Part way through his Miami stint LeBron obviously cruised a bit in the regular season and elevated his game once the playoffs came around. His numbers saw a significant jump.</p>

      <label for="ln7f44t" class="commentText"><p>Lol, you can look for yourself on Basketball Reference or a dozen other sites.</p>

<p>Look at 2014-15. LeBron in the regular season averaged 25/6/7 while coasting on defense. Cavs only won 53 games. In the playoffs LeBron turned it up 30/11/9 with great defense. Cavs went all the way to the finals where LeBron turned it up even higher to 36/13/9.</p>

<p>2016 LeBron was 25/7/6 in the regular season and won 57 games. In the playoffs he was 26/10/8 with incredible efficiency and elite defense and they dethroned the 73 win Warriors. In the finals he was 30/11/9.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same story every playoff run. Since 2014 LeBron is 29/9/8 in the playoffs and 32/11/8 in the finals, compared to 26/7/7 in the regular season. The most massive jump is in playoff elimination games, where LeBron is 35/11/8.</p>

<p>LeBron&rsquo;s playoff PER since 2014 is 28.5. In elimination games it&rsquo;s 32.5. Regular season is only 26.2.</p>

      <label for="ln4nzdq" class="commentText"><p>I literally wrote why? Because he was 2nd in MVP voting in 2020 so obviously it cannot logically be any part of the &ldquo;LeBron doesn&rsquo;t get top 3 in MVP because he&rsquo;s coasting in the regular season and only is the real, million times better LeBron in playoffs&rdquo; story. Because&hellip; he did.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not an opinion lol, getting an apple on Tuesday just physically cannot be a proof that you&rsquo;re not getting apples on Tuesdays. Like I&rsquo;m not trying to be smart lol, that&rsquo;s just what the words mean and it cannot be changed.</p>

<p>So which seasons after 2018 are the show of that exactly? In which of these seasons he was the best player in the playoffs and much better than in the regular season?</p>

<p>Very simple question, you can all educate a fool. Which seasons? You explain that something happened many many times so you know it well, which seasons exactly?</p>

<p>Outside of these, MJ only finished Top 10 one other time (6th)</p>

<p>Lebron also has finishes of 4, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10</p>

<p>Basically you can exclude all of Lebron’s seasons in the Top 3 of MVP voting and still have a hall of fame player</p>

Which is partially because MJ of course won more and partially because LeBronhad a stretch where he was the best player in the league but coasting in the regular season, which also helps the longevity.</p>

      <label for="ln58hzw" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s because Duncan&rsquo;s stats took a dip after the 04 season since that&rsquo;s when he started playing less minutes per game and he shared the offensive load more with Tony/Manu. He had a somewhat shorter run of elite statistical play compared to other greats in that he was still producing great numbers during later seasons but nothing that popped out.</p>

<p>His scoring fell to 20 points per game and below which generally makes it very rare to be called the very best player in NBA, Parker and Ginobili were doing an amazing impression on people following the games at the time, and Spurs overall were not THAT exciting as it might seem at that point.</p>

<p>Curry&rsquo;s better.</p>

<p>Oh, at the stats back this up, btw:</p>

<p>Over their respective careers (not counting Magic&rsquo;s <sup>1995</sup>&frasl;<sub>96</sub> season when he only started 9 games):</p>

<p><strong>-Lakers&rsquo; win % in games when Magic did NOT play: .589</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Warriors&rsquo; win % in games when Steph did NOT play: .363 (through the 2022 season, I haven&rsquo;t rerun the numbers with last season)</strong></p>

<p>Over their careers:-</p>

<p>-Curry&rsquo;s teams win about 29% more games when he plays than when he didn&rsquo;t play.</p>

<p>-Magic&rsquo;s teams won 15% more games with him than without him.</p>

<p>Curry averages less than 5p more a game than Magic despite playing in the most beneficial offensive era the league has even seen. Less than 5p a game. Magic was the best playmaker the league ever had. Curry isn’t even in the top 10 greatest scorers of all time.</p>

<p>And not even gonna bother with your laughable “well his team was better when he didn’t play so I guess that makes him a better player” that just grasping at the biggest straws to a point where it’s kind of sad.</p>

<p>Magic has more championships, more mvps, more finals MVPs, more first team all nbas. Was a better playmaker, better rebounder, better defender. It’s not close between them and it never has been.</p>

<p>I gave the best 9 seasons for each player.</p>

<p>Magic&rsquo;s go down further&hellip;. he only had 11 real seasons, and I gave you his best 9.</p>

<p>Add 2 more for Curry and those #10 &amp; 11 are basically where Magic&rsquo;s very best season was.</p>

<p>Hahahahaha lol can’t even with you nephews. That sentence alone disqualifies you from an ever having an opinion on basketball ever again.
Magic literally elevated the NBA from a sport that had its fucking finals on a tape delay to a top two sport in America. Magic and Birds effect on the league is bigger than anyone not named Michael Jordan.</p>

<p>Like wtf ….</p>

<p>Also I have no fucking idea how that is even relevant. Magic meant way more to the game and its popularity and inspired an entire generation to be interested in basketball. Curry was a top player in the league at a time where interest in the nba is waning and they are losing viewers.</p>

However Houston was the primary driver in pushing on the 3 point evolution. They led the league in 3p attempts every year from 2013 to 2020 except 1. For reference in those same year GSW was 6,4,1,5,18,8,24.</p>

<li>Curry is a far, FAR better scorer. Curry has multiple scoring titles, for instance.  Magic didn&rsquo;t even average 20 point per game in his career and topped out at 23 points in his highest season.</li>
<li>Neither player was known for their defense, but Curry has been a plus defender for part of his career (basically, since bulking up).  Magic never was. He was famously bad at it, actually.</li>
<li>Magic with the assist - the only major thing he was better at.  But in terms of helping teammates, Curry has been at least his equal, pulling double teams and providing spacing for other players. Yes, it&rsquo;s not a counting stat, but Curry has probably still helped more.</li>

<p>How about the fact that you are comparing players from completely different eras of basketball? With different rules in the game? So all of those stats are deceptive.</p>

<p>Also, Curry is more a SG than a PG. You basing that Curry is better because he scored more, then I argue that Bob Cousy is much better than both because he has more rings than either of them.</p>

<p>Funny how your argument really falls down to “eye test” + scores more and no one can counter with their own eye test? LOL Magic was a way better player than Curry. There’s a reason one is Magic and the other is just a chef.</p>

<p>I’m starting to think that you haven’t seen Steph play either.</p>

<p>Perhaps if you’d had seen Magic play you would understand it. You being born when you were born is not your fault. You being an idiot with clear recency bias and incapable of understanding what everyone else is telling you, is your fault.</p>

<p>Curry is a far better scorer (Magic averaged under 20 ppg for his career), and Curry&rsquo;s and Magic were about even on defense for much of Curry&rsquo;s career but has been better the latter part than Magic ever was.</p>

<p>The only major thing that Magic was better at was passing, but Curry helps his teammates get good shots in other ways so that&rsquo;s a wash.</p>

<p>And you can see it in the stats - if you look at their respective teams&rsquo; winning percentages with and without Curry and Magic over their careers, Steph has had a much bigger effect on his team winning.</p>

OKC with prime Westbrook and PG barely made playoffs in the last 2 games of the season, while the Nuggets were fighting with GSW hyperteam for 1st seed. There was a narrative about PG DPOY early that season and that narrative played a big part in MVP voting. There was absolutely ZERO reason for PG to be over Jokic</p>
