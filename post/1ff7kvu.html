      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ff7kvu/will_anthony_edwards_lead_the_timberwolves_to_a/"><p>Will Anthony Edwards lead the Timberwolves to a top 15 offense in <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The Wolves are Ant&rsquo;s team now and he has taken a massive leap, but not yet led the Wolves to a league average offense as their #1 guy the last two seasons.</p>

<p>The Wolves finished 17th on offense in the regular season in <sup>2023</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>. They were 6th in the playoffs, which did come at a slight cost to their defense which was still 7th and above average but not elite as in the regular season. Less Rudy means worse defense but more Rudy makes things a bit of a challenge for Minnesota offensively, which we saw a bit in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Ant still isn&rsquo;t an elite playmaker but took big strides in that department last year. It should be expected to see him take another leap in that department and perhaps his overall efficiency. Do you think he can lead the Wolves to an above average offense in the league? Or are matters beyond his control capping their ceiling on that end?</p>

      <label for="lmslpe6" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re 17th on offense, you can get to the top 15 just by chance. This isn&rsquo;t asking them to move from top 20 to top 10, it&rsquo;s just random shuffling.</p>

<p>They can choose to simply play faster and get there. Or they can play slower and drop to 20. Maybe a couple teams above them play slower or shoot 2% worse. There&rsquo;s a lot of wiggle room when you&rsquo;re midpack.</p>

      <label for="lmsl347" class="commentText"><p>People said Ant took a massive leap last year. I don’t think he has taken another massive leap this off-season necessarily and he is still on a pretty defensive oriented team.</p>

<p>I’d expect them to be marginally better on offence, but likely outside the top 10. Ant is a great iso player, and good scorer, but he doesn’t raise a teams offence the way other top offensive players have.</p>

      <label for="lmsmf8t" class="commentText"><p>What my analysis of Ant determined was&hellip;.<br>
I truly wonder the work he does off the court&hellip;.</p>

<p>Too many times during regular season games + especially playoff games when given more minutes.. he seemed GASSED at the end of games.</p>

<p>This is a player that NEEDS to step up in these last minute, close game opportunities and everytime he looked exhausted . He is young; &amp; isn&rsquo;t tasked with defending the best player on the court; so there is no excuse for him to get so tired so consistently. I wonder if its lack of discipline but he needs to undergo strength + conditioning evolution.</p>

      <label for="lmsorme" class="commentText"><p>He was 8th in Minutes played, and 5th in usage rating. Also plays a a play style which uses a lot of energy (a lot of stops and starts, using his speed/athleticism, playing hard on defence).</p>

<p>I think he hasn’t learned how to coast through a game, or how to pick his spots for where to use his energy.</p>

<p>I don’t think his conditioning is bad (probably could be a bit better) I think he just uses a lot of energy with his playstyle.</p>

      <label for="lmso7h9" class="commentText"><p>Edwards? No. Draft picks? Yes. Transition. Transition. TRANSITION. One of the worst transition scoring teams last year. Easy faucet of the game to makeup points that you aren&rsquo;t generating in a half court offense. Wolves are efficient but play slow. Solution? Draft the best transition college scorer and an up-tempo scoring guard. Easy way for rooks to score while adjusting the NBA.</p>

However, factors like team dynamics and roster adjustments, including the balance between offense and defense, will also play a crucial role in reaching that goal.</p>
