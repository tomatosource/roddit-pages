</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Mutumbo tore his quadriceps tendon in 2008, during his last (age 42) season with the Rockets.</p>

<p>Before this, he had never had a major injury. Considering his overall stature, it’s pretty surprising.</p>

<p>Are there any other centers you guys know of that showed this rare level of longevity?</p>

      <label for="lonvfj5" class="commentText"><p>This is probably the most similar player to what I’m getting at. I guess Kareem too but Parish feels like he fits the mold better of a dude that just grinded games for a really long time without seemingly any bad injuries.</p>

<p>I wonder if it’s just cold hard luck. Having dikembe and Yao on the same team was the definition of duality lol.</p>

      <label for="lonnlb1" class="commentText"><p>The Chief Robert Parish  is the PLAYER with the most longevity, in terms of games played</p>

<p>21 seasons 20 of which, at least 74 games played, that is absurd especially for a center, and will never be surpassed.</p>

<p>Also had a stretch in 15 seasons i believe half of them playing in every game, and another half missing 2 or less games</p>

<p>1,611 total games played.</p>

<p>For as long as Bron been playing, he&rsquo;s 119 games behind meaning he&rsquo;d hypothetically still have to play a full 82 game season and then follow it up with another 38 games played to pass Parish. Just to show how crazy that stat is</p>

      <label for="lonq1kb" class="commentText"><p>Ok, just because people have already mentioned KAJ and Parish, Shaq has kinda underrated longevity. His peak was short-lived, and there are memes about him playing in Boston, but he started his career in ‘92 at a high level and continued being a top center in the league into 2007-2008. The only time he didn’t play at least 50 games during that time was 2006-2007. For a guy that big to have maintained a high skill level for that long, it’s pretty impressive. I think the fact that he wore so many different colors towards the end of his career otherwise diminishes his longevity.</p>

<p>What do you mean Shaq’s peak was shorted lived? You contradicted yourself in the next sentence.</p>
