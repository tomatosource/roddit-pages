<p>It&rsquo;s like how in the NFL people thought BB was so good because he was hardassed when in reality he tailored his approach to what the player responded to.</p>

<p>Guys like BoB were straight up hardasses which is why a lot of players said they hated playing under him while with the Texans</p>

<p>But because this in an NBA subreddit;
&ldquo;BB&rdquo; means Bill Belichick, longtime Patriots coach.
&ldquo;BoB&rdquo; means Bill O&rsquo;Brien, a coach who was once under Belichick, who later tried head coaching in the NFL &amp; had 0 divisional playoff wins with prime JJ Watt and prime Deshaun Watson.</p>

      <label for="lewg92e" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think you’ve said anything incorrect but I think how you framed BoB’s time kind of undersells their success with him.</p>

<p>They won 4 division titles in his tenure and two of those were before Watson was in the league.</p>

<p>Watt was obviously very good but the Texans rosters were not typically flush with star talent and I think you could make an argument that BoB overachieved with them. The best team they had under him was probably the team that blew the lead against the Chiefs. Knocking him for that is fair game but they ultimately lost by 20 so it seems more like that was a case of not being able to sustain a fortunate start against a better team than blowing a game against an inferior or slightly better roster.</p>

<p>He gets clowned on as a coach when his biggest screw up was the D Hop trade as a GM. It was one of the dumber trades in NFL history, and the team seemingly imploded because of it, but I don’t think that should be cause for ignoring that he’s probably the most successful coach in their franchise history. Although Ryans probably passes him up pretty soon barring catastrophic injury to Stroud.</p>

<p>Watt, Clowney, Hopkins, prime Watson etc. Still didn&rsquo;t do much</p>

      <label for="leyexk8" class="commentText"><p>Every NFL playoff team has top end talent.</p>

<p>Watt was the best player in football for a stretch so not discounting him. DHOP probably had an  argument for best WR as well. When the second guy on your list is a player that has been a solid run defender but his whole career but has never had double digit sacks and the last guy on your list is “etc” and nobody immediately comes to mind (maybe Tunsil) I’m not sure I’m convinced I’ve said anything that was incorrect.</p>

<p>Compare their rosters to the playoff teams they lost to:</p>

<p>15-16 Chiefs (before Mahomes but it was Alex smith vs. Brian Hoyer)</p>

<p>16-17 Patriots (they upgraded to Brock Osweiller!)</p>

<p>18-19 Colts (this one I can see an argument either way)</p>

<p>19-20 Chiefs (I think this was their most talented roster but the Chiefs were on another level)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing where you have top end disparity like the Chargers for like last 20 years and then normal teams.</p>

<p>Imagine if we took Khalil Mack instead of Clowney which was a talking point, but also would&rsquo;ve been hindsight bias lol</p>

      <label for="lewsgzi" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, exactly - and this general attitude you’re responding to with this comment reflects a lot of what I see online lately, which is extremely black &amp; white thinking. I’m positive Bobby Knight was an ass hole but just because someone has flaws doesn’t mean they also don’t have something to offer or should immediately be written off.</p>

<p>I definitely wouldn’t have responded to a BK type but I played with some guys who came from some rough backgrounds and pretty much didn’t respond to anything else. Sure, ideally it would be nice to fix everyone’s issues at the core but that’s usually not possible, and at least this way there is some positive molding going on, even if it’s not ideal. </p>

<p>Something has to be wrong with you to think his behavior was acceptable.</p>

<p>Everyone responds to different types of motivation. We&rsquo;ve seen plenty of &ldquo;player-friendly&rdquo; coaches fail because they were doormats - eg, Steve Nash.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re naturally a disciplined self-starter, good for you. Other folks need a drill sergeant.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elrnAl6ygeM" target="_blank">scene in Glengarry Glen Ross</a>. Some people will react by saying Alec Baldwin is a big meany. And some people will react by saying &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go sell some goddamn real estate!&rdquo; They key is know what type of motivation works on each person.</p>

<p>Knight didn&rsquo;t treat every player the same.</p>
