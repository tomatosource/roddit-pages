</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The ringers list and pretty much every other list on here people make seems to have exactly the same issues each time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some players perform better in specific systems that hide their weaknesses other players are better 1st options, 2nd options etc and some excel in specific areas (Gobert etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>Trae Young was ranked 36th when he is a better 1st option than Jaylen Brown is (ranked 15th) and was ranked next to D White and Jrue at 37 and 38 which is a joke even as a non hawks fan.</p>

<p>Wemby already ranking over Haliburton, Butler, Kyrie, Fox, Lillard etc when hes barely done anything yet is also interesting.</p>

<p>Brown (15th) being ranked over better offensive players in Kyrie, Mitchell, Haliburton, Trae, Sabonis etc while those players do not have the luxury of playing in a 5 out system with 4 other above average playmakers/shooters/defenders who can spoon feed anyone on the team layups.</p>

<p>So how do are we ever meant to get a definitive ranking for players while adjusting for how good their teammates are and their actual impact.</p>

<p>TLDR: How do we define a ranking system for players while balancing out for system players and players that are on worse teams/have more responsibility</p>

      <label for="l9uuqad" class="commentText"><p>The only NBA rankings I find interesting but don&rsquo;t really matter is the Top 10 rankings. Both current and all time. There is no right answer, but I find it intriguing because we&rsquo;re discussing all time greats or the current best players. The idea of ranking who is the 24th best player or who is 40th best player is stupid and impossible, there&rsquo;s way too many variables. Especially when discussing current players. </p>

      <label for="l9uzp81" class="commentText"><p>As a fan, I think having overall rankings is actually really important in terms of contract evaluation and trade value. Whether your best player is the ~3rd, ~10th, or ~20th best player in the league matters a lot for many, many decisions (giving them the supermax, whether you need to trade for a top-10 or a top-20 player to contend, etc.). Positional rankings also matter for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Sure you can just go by vibes but IMO it&rsquo;s fun to put effort in evaluating your team&rsquo;s transactions and long-term strategy.</p>

<p>But those sort of rankings are more approximate than anything, since it&rsquo;s more important that the player is ~3rd best than whether they&rsquo;re actually 2nd or 3rd or 4th (which is what most fans fight about). So projects like Seth Partnow&rsquo;s tiers are valuable IMO, but the player-specific arguments of &ldquo;is Jaylen Brown better than Jalen Brunson&rdquo; or whatever are pretty pointless after a basic breakdown.</p>

<p>I think people don’t realize brown is putting up 23/6/4 as the #2 option on only 17.9 FGA. If you increased his usage and gave him the green light like trae or mitchell he could average 26-28/6/5 and give you all nba level defense . He literally 27/7/4 in 2023 when taking 20.6 FGA</p>

<p>It’s the same reason I laugh whenever people say Tatum doesn’t put up gaudy statlines. He doesn’t need to. Tatum has averaged 30/9/5 before . If we played that heliocentric style of basketball Tatum could average 32/11/7 or something but it wouldn’t benefit the team the way our roster is constructed .</p>

<p>Sure but his offense still isn&rsquo;t as good as the players mentioned here while he is better defensively no question, but these players also don&rsquo;t have the luxury of 54% of their FG assisted because they don&rsquo;t play with a team like the Celtics has. I am not saying JB isn&rsquo;t good but that is something to take into account.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think the only clear cut one right now is Jokic being the best in the league outside of that anything can be argued, but as someone else mentioned tiers probably work best</p>

<p>He is efficient and can drive, mid range, and hit 3s. Being on the Celtics, his overall scoring numbers went down with everyone else. But he can easily score 26+ on average like he did last season on pretty efficient numbers (other than FTs.)</p>

<p>The Celtics just won a title largely due to Jaylen Brown’s defense against one of the best offensive players in the league, to the point he was granted Finals MVP without leading his team in points, rebounds, or assists.</p>

<p>Trae, Hali, Kyrie, and Sabonis all have ranged from ‘hunted relentlessly and a massive liability’ to ‘the player on the floor everyone is trying to get in a switch’ in their playoff defensive performances.</p>

<p>So why should he be better than them?</p>

<p>There is reason he is much lower than them in EPM, RAPM, RAPTOR etc and pretty much any analytic measuring offense, this is more so just proving my original point</p>

      <label for="l9t47as" class="commentText"><p>This subreddit will never be the place to have this conversation without getting straw man replies but one of the reasons Brown&rsquo;s offensive analytic results are down on him, relative to fan perception, is that he plays in a regular season team environment where play connection (the &ldquo;next&rdquo; pass, for example making a short roll decision and getting the ball over to the corner ONLY AFTER the sunk man has rotated to the ball) is really important, and he is considerably worse at play connection than every other player in the Celtics&rsquo; top <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> (that&rsquo;s: Tatum, Horford, Porzingis, White, Holiday, Hauser, Pritchard).</p>

<p>Play connection is, in a player market sense, NOT the kind of valuable attribute that finishing through contact, handling at the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> position, or spot-up shooting is. BUT within the Celtics&rsquo; environment (extreme amount of shooting, great screen setters, lots of advantage situations) it&rsquo;s important.</p>

<p>Brown&rsquo;s defense, though, as we saw in the playoffs, actually became a lot more valuable because he plays within a ridiculous defensive system where it is relatively unimportant to make complicated off-ball defensive reads and cover for poorer players on the team.</p>

<p>Brown is ultimately a great exemplification of the fact that basketball is a team sport. He has a weird skillset that the Celtics finally optimized so well that people are now sometimes ranking him above guys like Mitchell or Booker who <em>often</em> look like <em>perfect</em> offensive players.</p>

<p>Lineups play basketball. Players play inside of lineups. It is a ridiculous abstract question to try to remove players from their team situations, and it&rsquo;s very cool that basketball GMs can ever manage to make a great, weird decision like the Nuggets made getting Aaron Gordon or the Celtics made getting Porzingis. Actual synergy we&rsquo;ve seen on court is way more interesting imo than trying to imagine what it would look like if Mitchell were on the Celtics or Steph Curry was alongside Jokic.</p>

      <label for="l9sxoor" class="commentText"><p>efficiency tends to go up in that case so I would imagine that Trae/Luka (whoever) has less PPG, Luka would be over 64% TS with the Celtics system and spacing, playing in an elite team doesn&rsquo;t really hinder your impact stats either such as EPM, RAPTOR, Net rtg etc it tends to improve it, which is why its surprising Browns is so low, but every other Celtics player has amazing impact stats/well above average</p>

<p>It feels like that’s become an accepted talking point but I’m not aware of any actual analysis of it.</p>

<p>Dame was way less efficient on the Bucks than he was on a way worse team in Portland. And he was more efficient games Giannis didn’t play. I think there’s something to guys who are used to being on ball having a more difficult time when they don’t get to dominate it to get in rhythm.</p>

<p>Hell, Tatum’s efficiency got worse this year with better spacing. And in watching him, at least part of that felt like it came down to him not touching the ball much for stretches then still being the one to get the ball at the end of the shot clock for a bail out shot.</p>

      <label for="l9ske2w" class="commentText"><p>I no world is brown better than Mitchell. Like at all. I’m not even trying to disrespect brown bc he is a great player but Mitchell when healthy would probably be top 7 in mvp two years in a row. He was 6th in epm and 5th in scoring at 28.6 ppg before his tendinitis came and ruined his 2nd half numbers. He would have been having an argument for 1st team and have 2nd team locked up 2 years in a row. Oh yeah but it’s not in Boston either insane spacing it’s in cle with bad spacing and a limited coach while getting the main attention on his team. The pace cle operates their offense is also one of the lowest in the league. Offense is the most import thing rn if you’re not a big and Mitchell just brings so much more offensively that’s not just scoring which he is better at too. Mitchell also holds his own on D so it’s not even like that hurts his argument. They’re just different tiers and it’s fine.</p>

      <label for="l9swza8" class="commentText"><p>the issue with ranking players is that no one can agree on a framework for how we’re ranking them. are we ranking players based on how good they’d be if they were the best player on the team, or are we ranking them based on how good they are at what they do for their team?</p>

<p>if we’re going with the first criterion then I’d probably prefer Trae, Mitchell or Haliburton as an offensive centerpiece over Brown. but going by the second, I’d rather have Brown as my #2 than any of those guys as my #1</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown just won the finals MVP.  He capped an amazing two month run through playoffs looking like the best 2 guard in the league.  Do you honestly feel - today, right this minute - that Tyrese Halliburton is a better overall player than Jaylen Brown?  That Kyrie is better, or Spider, or Trae Young, or even Domas Sabonis, they are better than Jaylen Brown?</p>

<p>Defense has to matter, as does coming up big in the clutch.  As does leadership, hustle, basketball IQ, etc.   Yes, the Celtics looked dominant - but I feel that Brown was their best player during these playoffs.  Of course, he&rsquo;s older than most of those guys - but that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to work.</p>

<p>I think there are strong arguments for each of those players over Brown yes, but also none of them would be as good in the position Brown is in right now. Its why a tier system is better than individual numbers</p>

<p>Brown can&rsquo;t lead an offense or playmake well enough to do what they do but none of them defend/cut as well as Brown does.</p>

      <label for="l9u1892" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you man.  But putting Kyrie above Brown after we all saw the finals is asinine.  They&rsquo;re both the second options on their teams, and Brown played better on both offense and defense.  I feel like there&rsquo;s very little argument for Kyrie over Brown.</p>

<p>Also implying Brown is worse than Hali and Young when those two consistently grade out as bottom 10 defenders in the league (props to Trae this year though, he was more like a below average defender this year instead of one of the worst) is silly.  No kidding those two are better offensive players.  They ought to be when they provide nothing on defense.  While in general I agree with your overall point, trying to list Brown at 15 as egregious is just being a hater.  15 isn&rsquo;t even out of line if you personally believe he&rsquo;s more like 20.</p>

<p>That’s a bullshit claim because we haven’t seen him as a #2. As A good shooter and great passer there is nothing to suggest he wouldn’t do well as a #2. If he played with Jokic or Giannis or Embiid (or Wemby in the future) he could definitely be the #2 on a contender</p>

<p>Brown didn&rsquo;t individually lock up Luka, it was a team effort because they know that the roleplayers cannot hit shots above the break.</p>

<p>Brown had a better series, but he also had the much better team. 54% of his shots were assisted vs 36% of Kyries and even less for Luka, its not even comparable</p>

      <label for="l9toa8v" class="commentText"><p>Being a threat off ball is a strength not a weakness… no player is without weaknesses. Luka is a consensus top 4 guy and he has 0 defensive ability, cant play off ball, and struggles with conditioning…. Thats a top 5 player, its easy to cherry pick weaknesses. Its also easy to diminish Celtics players because they were a good team, but that resulted in individual stats being sacrificed. Jaylen is a guy whos averaged nearly 27 points last season and was clearly significantly better this season despite his numbers going down to accommodate the other scorers on the team. Kyrie is an all time overrated player due to his insane highlights, he hasnt averaged over 23 ppg in the playoffs since leaving Cleveland… Jaylens done that twice in the last 3 years on better efficiency while having more team success and playing better defense</p>

<p>so? He plays a lot when Luka isn&rsquo;t on the court since they are literally the only 2 playmakers on the team.</p>

<p>Sure, when Brown/Tatum were way worse and Hayward was a shell of himself after breaking his leg lol, lets not pretends its todays team.</p>

<p>No, I think Brown is an all star but is starting to be heavily overrated due to the Celtics system.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t this reflected in the stats then? even with hockey assists it doesn&rsquo;t show up, from the eye test it was Tatum getting Brown a ton of open shots or Jrue</p>

<p>This is bait or has to be,</p>

<p>He is a large reason why the Mavs were in the finals, and literally had a better regular season than Brown lol.</p>

<p>Sure he struggles against Jrue and White and then help defense but the Celtics have the best backcourt defense in the league with those 2 so its not saying much in a comparison with brown</p>

<p>He goes on really good streaks and I really thought he was going to catch fire on the second half of game three (i think?) he had a couple banger layups in a row and then sink back into the shadows, his new M.O.</p>

      <label for="l9syo8n" class="commentText"><p>Holy shit. They are never supposed to be definitive. It&rsquo;s a thought exercise. Legacy is what drives athletes to compete. You want to be seen as better than everyone else, even if you don&rsquo;t say it. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with debating who is better than who, everyone is aware they don&rsquo;t know with 100% certainty. Anyone who does is being hyperbolic for the sake of the argument.</p>

      <label for="l9tavtx" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a team sport and star&rsquo;s productivity heavily depends on role players and coaches performance. Jay&rsquo;s, Al Horford and Jrue Holiday careers are the most recent examples. Al wasn&rsquo;t impactful with 76 and, my guy, Jrue got a ton of hate for a lack of offensive skills in Milwaukee. I don&rsquo;t even say about Jay&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Now, they&rsquo;re all on the same team and a lot of haters says they SHOULD take the championship. How is that if almost every star&rsquo;s were slandered?</p>

<p>Karl Malone and Steph Curry. By 2016 most people would say Curry was just better at basketball. Malone had 20,000 more points.</p>

NBA media seems to choose golden boys and shun other players, ignoring player performance.
But I agree with your overall premise, ranking players is futile</p>
