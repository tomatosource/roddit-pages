</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The ringers list and pretty much every other list on here people make seems to have exactly the same issues each time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some players perform better in specific systems that hide their weaknesses other players are better 1st options, 2nd options etc and some excel in specific areas (Gobert etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>Trae Young was ranked 36th when he is a better 1st option than Jaylen Brown is (ranked 15th) and was ranked next to D White and Jrue at 37 and 38 which is a joke even as a non hawks fan.</p>

<p>Wemby already ranking over Haliburton, Butler, Kyrie, Fox, Lillard etc when hes barely done anything yet is also interesting.</p>

<p>Brown (15th) being ranked over better offensive players in Kyrie, Mitchell, Haliburton, Trae, Sabonis etc while those players do not have the luxury of playing in a 5 out system with 4 other above average playmakers/shooters/defenders who can spoon feed anyone on the team layups.</p>

<p>So how do are we ever meant to get a definitive ranking for players while adjusting for how good their teammates are and their actual impact.</p>

<p>TLDR: How do we define a ranking system for players while balancing out for system players and players that are on worse teams/have more responsibility</p>

<p>I think people don’t realize brown is putting up 23/6/4 as the #2 option on only 17.9 FGA. If you increased his usage and gave him the green light like trae or mitchell he could average 26-28/6/5 and give you all nba level defense . He literally 27/7/4 in 2023 when taking 20.6 FGA</p>

<p>It’s the same reason I laugh whenever people say Tatum doesn’t put up gaudy statlines. He doesn’t need to. Tatum has averaged 30/9/5 before . If we played that heliocentric style of basketball Tatum could average 32/11/7 or something but it wouldn’t benefit the team the way our roster is constructed .</p>

<p>Sure but his offense still isn&rsquo;t as good as the players mentioned here while he is better defensively no question, but these players also don&rsquo;t have the luxury of 54% of their FG assisted because they don&rsquo;t play with a team like the Celtics has. I am not saying JB isn&rsquo;t good but that is something to take into account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in general, player rankings are always boring to me after the clear cut ones like Jokic/Giannis</p>

<p>I think the only clear cut one right now is Jokic being the best in the league outside of that anything can be argued, but as someone else mentioned tiers probably work best</p>

<p>He is efficient and can drive, mid range, and hit 3s. Being on the Celtics, his overall scoring numbers went down with everyone else. But he can easily score 26+ on average like he did last season on pretty efficient numbers (other than FTs.)</p>

<p>The Celtics just won a title largely due to Jaylen Brown’s defense against one of the best offensive players in the league, to the point he was granted Finals MVP without leading his team in points, rebounds, or assists.</p>

<p>Trae, Hali, Kyrie, and Sabonis all have ranged from ‘hunted relentlessly and a massive liability’ to ‘the player on the floor everyone is trying to get in a switch’ in their playoff defensive performances.</p>

<p>So why should he be better than them?</p>

<p>There is reason he is much lower than them in EPM, RAPM, RAPTOR etc and pretty much any analytic measuring offense, this is more so just proving my original point</p>

<p>This has played out in the eye test in every playoffs they’ve been involved in, where teams can key in on who they want to attack these players have always ended up as targets.</p>

      <label for="l9t47as" class="commentText"><p>This subreddit will never be the place to have this conversation without getting straw man replies but one of the reasons Brown&rsquo;s offensive analytic results are down on him, relative to fan perception, is that he plays in a regular season team environment where play connection (the &ldquo;next&rdquo; pass, for example making a short roll decision and getting the ball over to the corner ONLY AFTER the sunk man has rotated to the ball) is really important, and he is considerably worse at play connection than every other player in the Celtics&rsquo; top <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> (that&rsquo;s: Tatum, Horford, Porzingis, White, Holiday, Hauser, Pritchard).</p>

<p>Play connection is, in a player market sense, NOT the kind of valuable attribute that finishing through contact, handling at the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> position, or spot-up shooting is. BUT within the Celtics&rsquo; environment (extreme amount of shooting, great screen setters, lots of advantage situations) it&rsquo;s important.</p>

<p>Brown&rsquo;s defense, though, as we saw in the playoffs, actually became a lot more valuable because he plays within a ridiculous defensive system where it is relatively unimportant to make complicated off-ball defensive reads and cover for poorer players on the team.</p>

<p>Brown is ultimately a great exemplification of the fact that basketball is a team sport. He has a weird skillset that the Celtics finally optimized so well that people are now sometimes ranking him above guys like Mitchell or Booker who <em>often</em> look like <em>perfect</em> offensive players.</p>

<p>Lineups play basketball. Players play inside of lineups. It is a ridiculous abstract question to try to remove players from their team situations, and it&rsquo;s very cool that basketball GMs can ever manage to make a great, weird decision like the Nuggets made getting Aaron Gordon or the Celtics made getting Porzingis. Actual synergy we&rsquo;ve seen on court is way more interesting imo than trying to imagine what it would look like if Mitchell were on the Celtics or Steph Curry was alongside Jokic.</p>

      <label for="l9sxoor" class="commentText"><p>efficiency tends to go up in that case so I would imagine that Trae/Luka (whoever) has less PPG, Luka would be over 64% TS with the Celtics system and spacing, playing in an elite team doesn&rsquo;t really hinder your impact stats either such as EPM, RAPTOR, Net rtg etc it tends to improve it, which is why its surprising Browns is so low, but every other Celtics player has amazing impact stats/well above average</p>

      <label for="l9ske2w" class="commentText"><p>I no world is brown better than Mitchell. Like at all. I’m not even trying to disrespect brown bc he is a great player but Mitchell when healthy would probably be top 7 in mvp two years in a row. He was 6th in epm and 5th in scoring at 28.6 ppg before his tendinitis came and ruined his 2nd half numbers. He would have been having an argument for 1st team and have 2nd team locked up 2 years in a row. Oh yeah but it’s not in Boston either insane spacing it’s in cle with bad spacing and a limited coach while getting the main attention on his team. The pace cle operates their offense is also one of the lowest in the league. Offense is the most import thing rn if you’re not a big and Mitchell just brings so much more offensively that’s not just scoring which he is better at too. Mitchell also holds his own on D so it’s not even like that hurts his argument. They’re just different tiers and it’s fine.</p>

<p>That’s a bullshit claim because we haven’t seen him as a #2. As A good shooter and great passer there is nothing to suggest he wouldn’t do well as a #2. If he played with Jokic or Giannis or Embiid (or Wemby in the future) he could definitely be the #2 on a contender</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown just won the finals MVP.  He capped an amazing two month run through playoffs looking like the best 2 guard in the league.  Do you honestly feel - today, right this minute - that Tyrese Halliburton is a better overall player than Jaylen Brown?  That Kyrie is better, or Spider, or Trae Young, or even Domas Sabonis, they are better than Jaylen Brown?</p>

<p>Defense has to matter, as does coming up big in the clutch.  As does leadership, hustle, basketball IQ, etc.   Yes, the Celtics looked dominant - but I feel that Brown was their best player during these playoffs.  Of course, he&rsquo;s older than most of those guys - but that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to work.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown just won the finals MVP. He capped an amazing two month run through playoffs looking like the best 2 guard in the league. Do you honestly feel - today, right this minute - that Tyrese Halliburton is a better overall player than Jaylen Brown? That Kyrie is better, or Spider, or Trae Young, or even Domas Sabonis, they are better than Jaylen Brown?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there are strong arguments for each of those players over Brown yes, but also none of them would be as good in the position Brown is in right now. Its why a tier system is better than individual numbers</p>

<p>Brown can&rsquo;t lead an offense or playmake well enough to do what they do but none of them defend/cut as well as Brown does.</p>

Jay&rsquo;s, Al Horford and Jrue Holiday careers are the most recent examples. Al wasn&rsquo;t impactful with 76 and, my guy, Jrue got a ton of hate for a lack of offensive skills in Milwaukee. I don&rsquo;t even say about Jay&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Now, they&rsquo;re all on the same team and a lot of haters says they SHOULD take the championship. How is that if almost every star&rsquo;s were slandered?</p>

<p>Brown didn&rsquo;t individually lock up Luka, it was a team effort because they know that the roleplayers cannot hit shots above the break.</p>

<p>Brown had a better series, but he also had the much better team. 54% of his shots were assisted vs 36% of Kyries and even less for Luka, its not even comparable</p>
