</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The ringers list and pretty much every other list on here people make seems to have exactly the same issues each time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some players perform better in specific systems that hide their weaknesses other players are better 1st options, 2nd options etc and some excel in specific areas (Gobert etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>Trae Young was ranked 36th when he is a better 1st option than Jaylen Brown is (ranked 15th) and was ranked next to D White and Jrue at 37 and 38 which is a joke even as a non hawks fan.</p>

<p>Wemby already ranking over Haliburton, Butler, Kyrie, Fox, Lillard etc when hes barely done anything yet is also interesting.</p>

<p>Brown (15th) being ranked over better offensive players in Kyrie, Mitchell, Haliburton, Trae, Sabonis etc while those players do not have the luxury of playing in a 5 out system with 4 other above average playmakers/shooters/defenders who can spoon feed anyone on the team layups.</p>

<p>So how do are we ever meant to get a definitive ranking for players while adjusting for how good their teammates are and their actual impact.</p>

<p>TLDR: How do we define a ranking system for players while balancing out for system players and players that are on worse teams/have more responsibility</p>

<p>I think people don’t realize brown is putting up 23/6/4 as the #2 option on only 17.9 FGA. If you increased his usage and gave him the green light like trae or mitchell he could average 26-28/6/5 and give you all nba level defense . He literally 27/7/4 in 2023 when taking 20.6 FGA</p>

<p>It’s the same reason I laugh whenever people say Tatum doesn’t put up gaudy statlines. He doesn’t need to. Tatum has averaged 30/9/5 before . If we played that heliocentric style of basketball Tatum could average 32/9/7 or something but it wouldn’t benefit the team the way our roster is constructed .</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure but his offense still isn&rsquo;t as good as the players mentioned here while he is better defensively no question, but these players also don&rsquo;t have the luxury of 54% of their FG assisted because they don&rsquo;t play with a team like the Celtics has. I am not saying JB isn&rsquo;t good but that is something to take into account.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think the only clear cut one right now is Jokic being the best in the league outside of that anything can be argued, but as someone else mentioned tiers probably work best</p>

<p>He is efficient and can drive, mid range, and hit 3s. Being on the Celtics, his overall scoring numbers went down with everyone else. But he can easily score 26+ on average like he did last season on pretty efficient numbers (other than FTs.)</p>

      <label for="l9slllw" class="commentText"><p>The gap between the defense of JB and those players is just higher than whatever gap on offense between them you see.</p>

<p>The Celtics just won a title largely due to Jaylen Brown’s defense against one of the best offensive players in the league, to the point he was granted Finals MVP without leading his team in points, rebounds, or assists.</p>

<p>Trae, Hali, Kyrie, and Sabonis all have ranged from ‘hunted relentlessly and a massive liability’ to ‘the player on the floor everyone is trying to get in a switch’ in their playoff defensive performances.</p>

<p>So why should he be better than them?</p>

<p>There is reason he is much lower than them in EPM, RAPM, RAPTOR etc and pretty much any analytic measuring offense, this is more so just proving my original point</p>

<p>This has played out in the eye test in every playoffs they’ve been involved in, where teams can key in on who they want to attack these players have always ended up as targets.</p>

      <label for="l9ske2w" class="commentText"><p>I no world is brown better than Mitchell. Like at all. I’m not even trying to disrespect brown bc he is a great player but Mitchell when healthy would probably be top 7 in mvp two years in a row. He was 6th in epm and 5th in scoring at 28.6 ppg before his tendinitis came and ruined his 2nd half numbers. He would have been having an argument for 1st team and have 2nd team locked up 2 years in a row. Oh yeah but it’s not in Boston either insane spacing it’s in cle with bad spacing and a limited coach while getting the main attention on his team. The pace cle operates their offense is also one of the lowest in the league. Offense is the most import thing rn if you’re not a big and Mitchell just brings so much more offensively that’s not just scoring which he is better at too. Mitchell also holds his own on D so it’s not even like that hurts his argument. They’re just different tiers and it’s fine.</p>

<p>JB 23/6/4 EFG% 56</p>

<p>Yeah, &lsquo;big&rsquo; difference alright. And your point of pacing, Boston was 19th to Clevelands 24th. In the playoffs Cleveland went up to 8th and Boston was 12th. Find a new slant</p>

Trae Young is a #1 because of his playstyle but on a contender he would need to be focused on being a distributor to a real #1 and maybe even a elite #2 while being hidden on defense. Small score first guards aren’t necessarily the archetype for winning (outside of Isiah Thomas and Curry)</p>

      <label for="l9sivsa" class="commentText"><p>Just also wanted to say that you are better off ranking by tiers. Like it’s actually impossible to say who is 15 vs 16 vs 17 vs 18. Tiers make it easier. Like Bam vs Kyrie. I think they are on a similar tier but you can argue who is better or worse on both sides. </p>

<p>Or just don’t waste your time ranking haha. Will save you a bit of trouble.  </p>

<p>The top 20 would be fairly consistent.</p>

<p>It’s when things like longevity start to be as or more import as how good you were it gets messy.</p>

<p>Karl Malone and Steph Curry. By 2016 most people would say Curry was just better at basketball. Malone had 20,000 more points.</p>

<p>At worst he will be a fringe top 10 player in his second season and is likely to be closer to top 5.</p>
