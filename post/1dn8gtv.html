</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve got to be honest, I lean towards the ownership side rather than MJ because if I was in Krause or reinsdorf’s position. I wouldn’t want to risk losing my golden asset forever.</p>

<p>As for Jordon getting annoyed at the fact that they didn’t want to make the playoffs in the hope of getting a better draft pick was ridiculous from him in my opinion. I get the mentality of wanting to make the playoffs every year but there’s every chance the bulls could have got a top 5 pick in 1986 and could have beaten the pistons sooner than 1991. I feel like Jordan was being very selfish about thinking only about winning the game rather than looking at the bigger picture. hypothetically, what if the bulls got the number 1 pick and you add Brad Daugherty to that team of Jordan, Pippen and Grant. Just feel MJ could have thought more about the long run rather than just getting annoyed that the organisation weren’t trying to possibly make the playoffs because at the end of the day. They got swept by the celtics in the first round.</p>

      <label for="la0tadc" class="commentText"><p>I’m sure that if you were in Michael Jordan’s position as the 22 year old up and comer challenging Magic, Kareem, and Bird, you would have made every perfect decision without the benefit of hindsight. </p>

<p>It’s really too bad Jordan didn’t think about the long run. People might even consider him one of the GOATs if he had approached 85-86 differently.</p>
