      <label for="lskm8vc" class="commentText"><p>It’s interesting that certain players (Kobe, KD, Iverson, etc) have a particular iconic status with other NBA players, where they’re loved and elevated by their peers beyond where they probably rank all time.</p>

<p>Like Kobe might be 9th-11th all time, Durant somewhere around 14-15, but you get many players who will rank these guys in their top 5 ever.  Something about the aura these guys have and the pure bucket-getting they’ve been capable of that players really idolize.</p>

<p>it all adds up why Giannis elevates KD. Where else have we seen this pure of a scorer? Also, KD putting up 30+ in the season he came back from an injury most people would be a shadow of themselves.</p>

Genuinely thought he would take us out on his own after Kyrie went down. Pj was doing decent guarding him but I remember a decent amount of the fan base was begging for Bud to put Giannis on KD for more than a couple possessions but Bud loved watching PJ get cooked.</p>

<p>Only thing that we knew for sure from the start was this was the NBA Finals, nobody after that could give us that much trouble. Don&rsquo;t think any series can compare to that ever again for me.</p>

      <label for="lslaqr2" class="commentText"><p>Tbh, this is the kind of think that should rank them higher. It&rsquo;s the <em>greatest</em> players of all time, not the <em>best</em> players. Greatness isn&rsquo;t just about stats, talent, or skills. It&rsquo;s also about how one plays or carries themselves, it&rsquo;s how they inspire and influence others. And I think that&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s constantly missing in those &ldquo;GOAT debates.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lslx6i3" class="commentText"><p>Agreed on your point about greatness, but I disagree on the fact that it&rsquo;s not talked about.</p>

<p>It might not be mentioned *enough*, maybe, but you still hear a lot of arguments on AI or D Rose&rsquo;s auras. On Curry&rsquo;s influence on the game.</p>

<p>People use MJ&rsquo;s mythology, 6-0, pulling the NBA to another dimension, his impact on the game, etc, as arguments in the GOAT debate.</p>

<p>Same for Kobe&rsquo;s influence (which is why some people rank him super high), or how Cold as hell Larry Bird was.</p>

<p>Dismissing Wilt and Bill for their level of competition.</p>

<p>I think it influences many people&rsquo;s perception of a player&rsquo;s legacy when ranking, even if it&rsquo;s not always brought up in conversation, it still creates a bias for many people out there.</p>

      <label for="lslynz7" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s because of the variety of ways they can score. Their skill sets and the different abilities they display in NBA games is awe-inspiring. It&rsquo;s way more appreciated than guys who spam the same moves over and over even if they do it efficiently. People like to see the beauty in the game and the beauty in scoring is in footwork and variety of moves/shot making.</p>

      <label for="lslvo1y" class="commentText"><p>theyre obtainable as well. Kobe was truly not the best player but he willed himself to be. AI was short but an incredible skillset and ya sure maybe you gotta be a 7ft monster with massive wingspan to be KD but i think its more about his calmness and humbleness and just true dedication to the game that has other players so mesmerized. Players like LBJ and MJ are just not obtainable they dont seem real almost its hard to relate to that.</p>

      <label for="lsmbw48" class="commentText"><p>When I played basketball as a kid, I was a tall skinny kid. Coaches usually wanted me to be a big man, but I wanted to be more of a perimeter player. KD was really cool for me because he was tall and skinny but was allowed to do guard type stuff. I had a pretty good midrange jumpshot with a high release point that I can use to shoot over smaller defenders, and that was largely inspired by KD.</p>

<p>Giannis was also a tall skinny kid. He never developed into a great shooter like KD but he does have perimeter skills, which most guys his size don&rsquo;t have.</p>

      <label for="lslb5fu" class="commentText"><p>it&rsquo;s all of reddit now. everyone is racing to make either repetitive jokes/memes or just mean spirited comments. My gf asked a question in a more local sub hoping to get some help with something serious and it was still pretty much the same level of feedback.</p>

<p>I would have never guessed as a kid that the phrase &ldquo;if you have nothing nice to say say nothing at all&rdquo; would be so needed in modern times. People just can&rsquo;t help themselves.</p>

      <label for="lskimsx" class="commentText"><p>Thunder KD was fkin huge late 2000s-early 2010s. His shoes were fire, guy starred in a movie that easily hit with kids, and his off-court persona was massive. I remember seeing him everywhere. That era of basketball pre-Warriors KD was something special. I feel like people were still sour on Lebron for The Decision and Steph hadn’t quite broken the stratosphere yet in terms of legacy. KD was definitely the face of the league, and I could see how players born in the late 90s-early 2000s would idolize him. Feels like Steph is more middle Gen Z and Bron is early-mid 90s</p>

<p>Kd hit the ground running as soon as he entered the league.</p>

<p>Dude has been that guy since day 1 and still is. Giannis wasn’t. Jokic wasn’t. Embiid wasn’t. Curry wasnt. Those dudes grew into being great. Nothing against any of those guys a I listed above, they are all great, but credit is due to guys who come into the league as all nba type players and continue to be elite players throughout their entire career</p>

<p>This is just not true. Look up the young rookies coming into the league and who they idolize/have as their GOAT. It&rsquo;s often KD, Bron or even Paul George lol but rarely if ever do they say Curry.</p>

<p>And these rookies are like 19-23.. which means they were still in their pre teens - early teens when Curry hit his peak.</p>

<p>6 years olds can barely comprehend what they&rsquo;re watching lmfao. I&rsquo;m currently in my mid 20s and mostly grew up on 2010s ball, as did most of my peers. If you&rsquo;re old enough to have watched KD then you&rsquo;re likely old enough to have seen Curry&rsquo;s prime as well</p>

<p>we all saw 2021 and the whole thing was yeah he&rsquo;s probably the best player in the league rn and #KDbetter</p>

<p>but after Steph won in 2022, it was like well Steph is clearly better now!</p>

<p>and i don&rsquo;t have a problem with it&hellip; but people like it&rsquo;s not even close and that you&rsquo;re an idiot if you have like KD 12 and Steph 13</p>

<p>Steph won and KD didn&rsquo;t cause of circumstances, Steph&rsquo;s team was healthy, KD&rsquo;s team got injured, not just 1, but both of them</p>

<p>2021 KD was every bit as good as what Steph did in 2022</p>

<p>but after Steph won in 2022, it was like well Steph is clearly better now!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2022 got the &ldquo;count the ringzzz&rdquo; narrative people back on Curry&rsquo;s side. That, plus dumbasses parroting Barkley&rsquo;s &ldquo;bus rider, bus driver&rdquo; nonsense.</p>

<p>And Curry always had the stat nerds on his side.</p>

<p>Every impact metric showed Curry being better than Durant before, during, and after their stint together (though Durant was better last year).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>EPM has Curry above Durant every season from 2014-2023</p></li>

<li><p>RAPTOR has Curry above Durant every season from 2014-2023</p></li>

<li><p>LEBRON has Curry above Durant every season from 2015-2023 except for 2019</p></li>

<li><p>5-Year RAPM has Curry above Durant for every 5-year period from 2012-2016 through 2019-2023.</p></li>

      <label for="lskiwir" class="commentText"><p>NBA fans are reactionary, Durant had an amazing series against Milwaukee in 2021 and was great in golden state next to Curry.</p>

<p>His playoff resume outside of that, not just team results but actually production is pretty underwhelming. Boston was able to attack KDs handle and be physical with him, force him to be a playmaker and he struggled. Just like Memphis, Golden State and San Antonio(2014) were able to do.</p>

<p>Does curry have as big of an exploitable flaw as your main offensive focal point? There’s also the fact that throughout his prime Curry has proved to be much more impactful as a playmaker/shot creator for his teammates.</p>

<p>Durant has much better longevity than Curry which is his best argument, and it’s not a bad one since he was an all-nba level player before Curry became an all star. Curry was the better player during their primes though, pretty much all the data we have shows he was more impactful to winning.</p>

      <label for="lskq7w3" class="commentText"><p>Durant is the more versatile and better defender but how much is his defense moving the needle? It&rsquo;s definitely a stretch to say he was near all-defense level throughout his prime. Most of the evidence points towards him being maybe a bit better than a slight positive on defense. I think there is a little bit of a broad range in how you could view his defense, so there might be some uncertainty there.</p>

<p>People probably just hesitate to put KD ahead because two of those rings came with Steph as the best player (media couldn’t use the I WANT IGUODALA excuse the second time). Is it fair? Its a team sport after all, circumstances are different every year. But its a standard most if not all players are held to.</p>

      <label for="lsla1kl" class="commentText"><p>Its because of the things people like being different.</p>

<p>Many posters here don&rsquo;t understand basketball on a level beyond being able to read stats, and construct narratives regarding that. Which, tbf, could get them a job on ESPN if enough people were willing to listen to the opinions.</p>

<p>NBA players understand the game from the &ldquo;I have to do this shit and XYZ is the actual difficult part&rdquo; so they have increased respect for different types of players. For example isolation scorers will get more respect in general because its the single hardest skill in basketball to do consistently, whereas on reddit guys who are more efficient even if their points are a result of working within their system are given more respect.</p>

Like, i could understand it if he was a bum or if he had other activities he valued over basketball, like going to strip clubs or waving guns around on IG on eating wings until he’s out of shape or whatever… but all this dude has done is ball. his whole life. that’s <em>it.</em> when he watches tv, it’s basketball. when he plays video games, it’s 2k. when he smokes up, he’s doin a basketball podcast. he plays in the olympics. his wardrobe is pretty much hoopin clothes.</p>

<p>I’ll give him a pass for joining the warriors. especially because you can argue he was the best player on their team.</p>

I tend to ignore the media narratives &amp; genuinely don’t watch any of the debate or sports shows, just go off what I see. KD is the best scorer to ever step on the court.</p>

In the next era you see players like Giannis, Ant, Wemby etc modeling their game after KD and the smaller guard prototypes or 1 guards modeling their game after Steph, this includes players like Trae Young and maybe Luka.</p>

      <label for="lsmcdzf" class="commentText"><p>For tall guys like Giannis who are almost 7&rsquo; or 7-footers I imagine watching KD do everything he can do is very inspiring for them because for decades guys that tall were just told to get in the paint and bulk up and bang bodies instead of handle the ball, work on footwork and be allowed to shoot from anywhere</p>

<p>KD outplayed Giannis in that series, he was 1 inch away from winning that game, even with Giannis stepping under Kyrie, Harden on one leg and Joe Harris being unable to hit a single wide open 3, I agree it was the best KD we&rsquo;ve seen</p>

      <label for="lsmgpse" class="commentText"><p>KD has been in the league long enough people don’t even remember his Warriors days. Yeah as a Warriors fan admittedly it seemed unfair but only because Kevin Durant was still producing at an insane level. KD gets maligned a lot even by GSW fans but he was the second best basketball player on the planet for the 2010s in my opinion and has a case for single most talented player in the 2010s.</p>

      <label for="lsl9wde" class="commentText"><p>That series still angers me.  Giannis undercut Kyrie on purpose.  Teague even admitted the team felt whooped after g1-2.</p>

<p>And if not for a monumental sell job from guys like Joe Harris who folded under the pressure of hitting open shots, KD would have dusted the Bucks himself.</p>

<p>It all came down to a toe, and I think the adrenaline dump of thinking he called series left KD completely drained for that OT</p>
