      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eifbmd/which_one_of_these_eastern_conference_upstarts_do/"><p>Which one of these Eastern Conference upstarts do you think is the closest to true contention&mdash;Indiana or Orlando?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Indiana on paper is the easy answer as they made the Eastern Conference finals last season and Haliburton is the best player on either team. Siakam is probably the second best player on either team at this point and Haliburton has proven himself to be a ceiling raiser. Indiana has the top end talent advantage and players like Turner and Nembhard are excellent fits around their two stars.</p>

<p>That being said, the Magic have made a big addition with KCP at the 2. He does a little more offensively than people think&mdash;he&rsquo;s a fantastic pull-up shooter over the past few years. He&rsquo;s gonna presumably have a bigger offensive role with Orlando than he did with Denver and we may see that showcased a bit more. Obviously we know he&rsquo;s also very good on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Ant Black showed some strong flashes as a rookie, and Jonathan Isaac is healthy from the jump. A top 10 defender in this league. Jett Howard displayed his shotmaking abilities in G-League and is gonna get a chance this season to play. His shooting talent is something the Magic have needed. Bitadze/Wagner a good backup C pair.</p>

<p>Franz hasn&rsquo;t made the huge offensive leap some imagined he would quite yet, although he&rsquo;s certainly grown as a creator, but Paolo took a definite step forward last season (better shooting, higher assist rate, better finishing, etc.) and is primed to take another in the year ahead.</p>

<p>Orlando was a top 3 defense last season. With KCP it isn&rsquo;t out of the realm of possibility they&rsquo;re even better this season. Maybe even the top defense in the league.</p>

<p>Top 3 offense vs Top 3 defense. Which one of these two teams do you think is closest to true contention in a theoretically healthy and improved Eastern Conference. Boston is obviously the team to beat, but do you think either team could challenge the Celtics, or are truly in that second tier with the Knicks/Sixers/Bucks?</p>

<p>My dream was to move Nesmith down to the 2 and trade for Deni Avidja at the 3 (i.e. surrounding Hali with plus wing defenders). I worry that the dual-guard lineup of him and Nembhard isn&rsquo;t the way to go.</p>

      <label for="lg66tpm" class="commentText"><p>Yes but its just putting some more tape on the real issue at hand. KCP is obviously an improvement over Harris but it still does not move the needle one bit. Truly a perfect guy for them would be a guy that could initate their offense, shoot the three well and give them another true scoring option. I think closest player that may be on the market in the future that would fit would be Darius Garland. I doubt Cavs would trade him to a rival team. Sexton like I said would also be good plainly for the scoring aspect and he is a better playmaker than KCP or Gary Harris. This would help in both the scoring and playmaking departments on this team.</p>

Two of them in the starting lineup makes no sense when they don&rsquo;t have a primary initator and neither of them are good playmakers. Their problem is not defense. If I just magically gave them Sexton instead of KCP, this team would be better. Sexton is not a great playmaker but he will help the spacing and the scoring issue. They need a guy that can get a bucket.</p>

<p>If you think 32 year old Khris and 33 year old Dame are declining what do you think that 34 year old yall just paid an absolute shit ton of money is gonna do?</p>

<p>Sure we have dame as a poa defender but yall have Maxey lmao.</p>

<p>Btw our starting 5 had the best defensive rating in the league, it was the bench that was bringing us down and they upgraded it this offseason.</p>

<p>You guys literally lost in the first round too lmao sixers fan talking like this is wild</p>

      <label for="lg6gtw4" class="commentText"><p>Which tiny guards? It’s usually ones with an injury history and dame doesn’t really have that. Why is Steph still playing elite?</p>

<p>You ignored everything else I said which is convenient cause you have no argument.</p>

<p>Embiid and pg barely play 60 games a season, y’all are more likely to be a 6-7th seed than the bucks</p>

      <label for="lg6i5wx" class="commentText"><p>Dame is both smaller and a worse defender than Steph&hellip;and Steph is Steph, there is no equal. Your team&rsquo;s defense is going to be ass. You are relying purely on offense in the playoffs to win, while the defensive weaknesses will be exploited every which way and twice on Sundays. Lopez will be 37 years old in the playoffs, and already showed significant decline last season. No way in hell ya&rsquo;ll finish above us in seeding.</p>
