      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eifbmd/which_one_of_these_eastern_conference_upstarts_do/"><p>Which one of these Eastern Conference upstarts do you think is the closest to true contention&mdash;Indiana or Orlando?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Indiana on paper is the easy answer as they made the Eastern Conference finals last season and Haliburton is the best player on either team. Siakam is probably the second best player on either team at this point and Haliburton has proven himself to be a ceiling raiser. Indiana has the top end talent advantage and players like Turner and Nembhard are excellent fits around their two stars.</p>

<p>That being said, the Magic have made a big addition with KCP at the 2. He does a little more offensively than people think&mdash;he&rsquo;s a fantastic pull-up shooter over the past few years. He&rsquo;s gonna presumably have a bigger offensive role with Orlando than he did with Denver and we may see that showcased a bit more. Obviously we know he&rsquo;s also very good on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Ant Black showed some strong flashes as a rookie, and Jonathan Isaac is healthy from the jump. A top 10 defender in this league. Jett Howard displayed his shotmaking abilities in G-League and is gonna get a chance this season to play. His shooting talent is something the Magic have needed. Bitadze/Wagner a good backup C pair.</p>

<p>Franz hasn&rsquo;t made the huge offensive leap some imagined he would quite yet, although he&rsquo;s certainly grown as a creator, but Paolo took a definite step forward last season (better shooting, higher assist rate, better finishing, etc.) and is primed to take another in the year ahead.</p>

<p>Orlando was a top 3 defense last season. With KCP it isn&rsquo;t out of the realm of possibility they&rsquo;re even better this season. Maybe even the top defense in the league.</p>

<p>Top 3 offense vs Top 3 defense. Which one of these two teams do you think is closest to true contention in a theoretically healthy and improved Eastern Conference. Boston is obviously the team to beat, but do you think either team could challenge the Celtics, or are truly in that second tier with the Knicks/Sixers/Bucks?</p>

I&rsquo;m not saying it would have been a sweep or anything like that, but I remember the general vibe being that Indiana was winning shootouts against a depleted Bucks roster. Giannis would have feasted on that defense. </p>

      <label for="lg64rah" class="commentText"><p>They have two shooting guards starting in their offense. They don&rsquo;t have a guy that is an initator and Paolo should not be your primary guy. He averaged 5.4 assists to 3.1 turnovers for a reason. They have a clunky offense and don&rsquo;t have enough guys that can really go out there and get their own bucket.</p>

      <label for="lg65r0i" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m saying they already have a player like him in Suggs. Two of them in the starting lineup makes no sense when they don&rsquo;t have a primary initator and neither of them are good playmakers. Their problem is not defense. If I just magically gave them Sexton instead of KCP, this team would be better. Sexton is not a great playmaker but he will help the spacing and the scoring issue. They need a guy that can get a bucket.</p>
