<p>I’m looking at our Curry situation the same way. The stranglehold of the cap situation we put ourselves in (same with Bron going full max) is just the price to pay. Can’t give the support they need at this stage but not for a lack of trying.</p>

<p>Edit: should clarify I mean this current off-season and the final 2-3 years both Curry and Bron seem to have left.</p>

      <label for="li9h2lx" class="commentText"><p>I mean I think with both of those teams they sold out for championships with these two at what? Age 35 and 34?</p>

<p>Then they have them competing for the playoffs every single year, even getting to the WCFs with Lebron at age 37.</p>

<p>Both Steph and Lebron still command max contracts but aren’t as good as guys like Jokic or Giannis anymore and their teams have less cap flexibility than younger teams like the Celtics who also have a star that’s getting closer to Steph and Bron as they get older.</p>

<p>Could they have done better? Maybe, but I feel like people really underrate the literal championships both teams have gotten in the past 4 years and again Bron made a WCFs two seasons ago too.</p>

<p>I follow Dodger baseball and people kept saying we were wasting Kershaw’s prime years, etc. even though we averaged like 100 wins a season for the past decade. 😵‍💫 Wasting prime years would be Mike Trout on the Angels never going anywhere.</p>

      <label for="li9ts5n" class="commentText"><p>People take for granted how difficult it is to build a championship contending team, much less actually winning a chip. Especially in todays league where theres so many highly talented teams. It’s a real bloodbath especially in the west. Even in the relatively weak eastern conference of Lebron’s prime years it’s absolutely ludicrous that he made the finals as many consecutive years as he did. That’s his biggest argument for goat imo.</p>

<p>Lakers have undoubtedly made some big time blunders (Russ being the most obvious one) but they’ve also made some good moves too at times and I’d argue given LeBron and AD solid squads more seasons than not. It’s just bloody difficult to go all the way. And this is without even mentioning the injury factor which has seemed to affect the lakers more than most teams during the LeBron era. I think they could have 2 chips if they had better injury luck.</p>

      <label for="lia30x1" class="commentText"><p>LeBron is also culpable in this, lol. He&rsquo;s the one who orchestrated the Westbrook trade. The only real indefensible thing that Pelinka did was let Caruso walk in favor of THT. That was dumb. Also, I don&rsquo;t really think Mike Conley was going to move the needle. Would the Lakers have beat Denver in 2023 WCF if they had Conley? Doubtful. And D&rsquo;Lo is a valuable regular season contributor at least, he had arguably his best career year last year. Sure he sucked in the playoffs for 2 years, but Conley wasn&rsquo;t winning them a title.</p>

<p>On the other hand, LeBron could&rsquo;ve taken a pay cut to help w/ the financial situation, but chose not to.</p>

<p>The Lakers are pretty hamstrung. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really fair to say that they are &ldquo;squandering&rdquo; his last chance at a title. A year ago media PRAISED Pelinka for salvaging the Westbrook deal and turning a 13th seed into a team that made the WCF. Last offseason everyone was like &ldquo;this Lakers team is gonna be real good with a whole offseason + training camp.&rdquo; But all of a sudden now they&rsquo;re squandering things?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s unfortunately not much the team can do. They have 2 firsts to trade, plus a lot of salary filler, but its not like Pelinka can force other teams to trade valuable rotation pieces. If other teams don&rsquo;t want to make trades w/ the Lakers, they can&rsquo;t do anything about it. It&rsquo;s not like Pelinka is sitting on his ass playing solitare all day, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s working to upgrade the team. However, I think it&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of 1 year ago people being very bullish on the Lakers, and it&rsquo;s not like the team got worse. If anything, more time with the same group together can only improve their chemistry, and most of their guys are young enough that they should continue to improve.</p>

<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re def not the favorites, but I don&rsquo;t really think there&rsquo;s really anyone to &ldquo;blame&rdquo; for the situation. Everything leading up to 2020 brought the team 1 championship and a WCF appearance.</p>

      <label for="li9wp6d" class="commentText"><p>Lakers get heat for being a cheap organization when that isn&rsquo;t the actual issue. Jim Buss and Johnny Buss want to bust the trust that owns 66% of the Lakers and sell their shares of the team. They tried to angle for control to do this through lawyers when Jim Buss was fired. In an interview a bit after, Janie Buss (not Jeanie) said that as long as the the business part of the Lakers continues to do well, Jim and Johnny have no standing and Jeanie will continue to run the team with the rest of the siblings supporting her.</p>

<p>Which then means, every financial decision the Lakers make has to make financial sense. They cannot opt to make short term losses for long term gain like the Warriors because they have the threat of a lawsuit that would put 22% of the Lakers on the market and make the rest of the Buss family minority owners.</p>

The team kind of <em>had</em> to keep Lebron happy, or else he potentially leaves (and this sub laughs for the Lakers allowing Lebron to walk) and then who knows what happens. But a lot of what it takes to keep Lebron happy also limits what roster moves they can make to ultimately make the team competitive. It’s not as easy as “lol just give Lebron less money duh”. Similar situation to the Warriors, will likely be a similar situation for the Bucks in a couple years, and as a Blazers fan it’s pretty similar to what happened with Dame.</p>

<p>Last season everybody was saying the Nuggets were a historically great team, the Lakers played them incredibly close in every game to the point they needed two different miracle buzzer beaters to lose. But, since they lost to Minnesota, or because you didn’t actually watch the series where the results could have been flipped by single plays, they were never a threat.</p>

<p>The year before they are in the western conference finals, but they lost, so no threat.</p>

<p>Like.. they have a 40 year old star player, they aren’t going balls out in the regular season. When they make the playoffs, they are a tough out. If things fall right, they can compete for a championship.</p>

<p>If this was any other team, people wouldn’t have issue calling them a contender based off their body of work in the playoffs.</p>

The huge difference is the bench between the two teams and players like Hachimura and Reeves starting. Also while Lebron is still incredible, he had his moments last playoffs where he looked gas and the days of him playing 45 minutes averaging 35/10/10 while dominating the entire game at all times is gone now.</p>

<p>If you run into OKC, Mavs, Minny, or the Nuggets in the first round this year, you&rsquo;re heading to Cancun in 5 or 6 games.</p>

<p>Labron supposedly dictates some player moves &hellip;. so he isn&rsquo;t involved / responsible even a little?</p>

<p>I have trouble buying into him as some sort of victim here / uninvolved.</p>

<p>Edit: To be clear, I think the Lakers front office is a joke too.</p>

      <label for="li9j5th" class="commentText"><p>This is a stupid ass take I&rsquo;m gonna be so honest. Who else do they draft with a literal late 50s pick?</p>

<p>Did LeBron tell them to draft him? Yes. Would they have drafted him if they had the 5th pick instead of the 55th? Fuck no.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s legit such a stupid thing to argue about. The Lakers drafting Bronny with that pick is the equivalent of LeBron asking them for 10 bucks for a Wendy&rsquo;s order. It is not consequential at all. Them drafting Bronny does not change their chance of winning a championship. It&rsquo;s just a nice favour for a player who has played for them for 6 years at this point and got them a chip.</p>

      <label for="li9kqw5" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re obviously not independent, as any superstar, especially one of LeBron&rsquo;s calibre will have some sort of sway in the front office.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just insane that people act like LeBron single-handedly destroyed the team with this power no one else has. God forbid the Lakers may change their opinions on who to target based on one of the best basketball players of all time arguably with the highest basketball IQ we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

<p>He made a bad decision with Westbrook yes (which by the way, Westbrook turning into Patrick Beverly a year after averaging a triple double is somehow LeBron&rsquo;s fault, and even if the fit wasnt good, the entire point of the Westbrook trade was to have a great facilitator for when LeBron was on the bench, you know, him being 37 and all that). But if people thing he decided to let go of people like Caruso it&rsquo;s just straight up blind hatred at that point.</p>

Not saying he&rsquo;ll be a star or anything but he has a lot more potential than a lot of guys I&rsquo;ve seen drafted in that range over the years.</p>

      <label for="li9znxp" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, the Cavs made multiple versions of the Russ trade when Lebron was there in his first stint.  There are like 4 or 5 horrendously awful decisions the Cavs made in the mid 2000s, I would say way worse than what the Lakers have done.</p>

It&rsquo;s annoying and will still be annoying hearing the &ldquo;oh Lakers have 2 top ten players they need more help tho&rdquo; and around January when we are in dog water, LeBron, AD, and/or Reddick will have some quote out there like:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a physically dominant team and we don&rsquo;t get the calls to show for it&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our star players are always attacking the paint and get no calls down there. Some teams just get a better whistle than us&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re X in the league in paint scoring and x in the league on FTa a game. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then cue up the free throw advantage, trading for some random role player and magically there&rsquo;s nothing but good press all around.</p>

I mean the original westbrook trade fucking sucked, but a 50 million dollar expiring does not COMPLETELY eliminate any flexibility or ability to make improvements. The lakers inability to get basically ANY decent role players is shocking.</p>

<p>Their best role players are guards (reaves and dlo) who are good on offense but suck on defense. The lakers have multiple first round picks to work with right now, and yet they still aren&rsquo;t getting ANY good role players.</p>

      <label for="li9f572" class="commentText"><p>This is Lebron&rsquo;s fault. When they won in 2020 they had a championship team. Then they had one season of bad injury luck and Lebron blew it up.  The unloaded the cupboard, and now its bare.  They also had the problems where they didn&rsquo;t want to make longer extensions past Lebron&rsquo;s small extensions. Which mean that free agents were taking longer cheaper deals elsewhere and Ty Lue didn&rsquo;t want to be a part of this short term process.</p>

<p>The only way to dig themselves out would be for JJ to start dialing up plays for Cam Reddish and Wood, boost their trade value and ship them out for someone that can make up for the extreme defensive holes.</p>

He got all the control over roster decisions and head coaches that he wanted, and in return he got 1 ring that he had to absolutely drag them to.</p>

<p>Then he goes to LA and it’s the same shit. Terrible roster decisions, a head coaching carousel, and LeBron pulling the strings the entire time.</p>

<p>I love LeBron but I think it’s undeniable that between Cleveland and LA he spent the vast majority of his career playing for mediocre coaches and front offices, all by his choice. It’s why I believe he has 2 rings in his 4 years in Miami and 2 rings in his other 16 seasons.</p>

<p>The last three off seasons have been “win-now” for the Lakers where they mortgage their future and draft/trade capital for another ring with Lebron.</p>

<p>Multiple off-seasons of making lopsided trades is eventually going to run your team dry. At a certain point, you have no future left to mortgage.</p>

<p>The options this year were to make LeBron happy&hellip; or have him leave. The best option is the former, because at this time there is no next star coming to Lakers. They are stuck building around LeBron and AD. Which isn&rsquo;t all that bad.</p>

<p>They hired a very exceptional basketball mind. A rookie at this but a very smart guy on the court with a ton to offer. Liked by the players. Who was a better option? they tried it many times the old way and it didn&rsquo;t work as well. So why not try a new approach.</p>

<p>So they drafted his son&hellip; big deal. If it was Joe Schmoe drafted instead no one would bat an eye.</p>

<p>At this point in their careers..no one should be mad if they find a way to team up and go for a Last Dance together.</p>

<p>IMO if LeBron gets a 5th ring&hellip;he would be at worst on pat with MJ in the GOAT convo if not ahead&hellip;.just 1 fewer title with all kinds of stat records.</p>

<p>If Curry gets 1 more ring&hellip; he&rsquo;d be on par with Kobe,Duncan and Magic on 5 championships to go along with 3 pt records amd changing the game.. He&rsquo;d enter the top 5 players conversation.</p>

I know the NFL doesnt have much parity, but LeBron could have taken a pay cut at some point. But at the end of the day, who cares? Lakers already got their championship. Owners are still making billions. LeBron is making millions. Everyone is happy&hellip;well besides the Ringer I guess. </p>

Edit: And they had to draft his son lol, forget that GG Jackson was a second round pick but lakers just have to cater to leGm</p>
