<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;MJ is one, Kobe is two, and LeBron is three. I don&rsquo;t think that MJ had a flaw in his game,&rdquo; said Horry. &ldquo;People say he couldn&rsquo;t shoot threes but he could shoot threes when he wanted to shoot them he just didn&rsquo;t need to shoot threes&hellip; Kobe is the same way. And I think LeBron is a great player. I&rsquo;m not knocking LeBron, he&rsquo;s still 1C and Kobe&rsquo;s 1B and Mike is first. I know the body of work these guys put in but is there a flaw in LeBron&rsquo;s game? Yes. Was there a flaw in Kobe&rsquo;s game? Yes. Was there a flaw in Michael&rsquo;s game? No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only other guards in the top 10 are MJ and Magic (PG). What exactly do you mean? If anything, center dominantes. Wilt, Bill, Shaq, Duncan, Kareem, Hakeem take up 6 out of the 10 spots in the top 10.</p>

If they were putting someone as GOAT for aesthetics, why haven&rsquo;t I heard anyone say AI or Gary Payton are the GOAT?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just so funny as Kobe is the 3rd most mentioned name in the GOAT debate along MJ and Lebron, but people here think it&rsquo;s just some coincidence or do mental gymnastics to convince their own psyche why Kobe sucks. When is the last time you read a post saying Hakeem, Magic, Bird, Shaq, Duncan, or Curry are the goat?</p>

      <label for="l7qg58a" class="commentText"><p>Kobe’s among the most respected players of his generation, probably the most respected because he played like a hooper and he was tough as shit. That will get you respected. That doesn’t mean he was the best though. Combine that with the people in his generation being the lead media guys and then him getting even more venerated after his death, and you get people rating him higher. He’s top 3 most influential players and known players, and top 3 most respected players, so people will always talk about him like that. It doesn’t mean he was that guy the whole time.</p>

<p>I don’t get why you feel the incessant need to constantly post these things trying to argue it’s Kobe and Mike as the top 2. It’s actually nonstop w you lol</p>

Saying he&rsquo;s not the GOAT but he&rsquo;s top 10 is not some crazy insult and saying he&rsquo;s like bottom of the barrel. To NBA players, some of their rankings are popularity contests and influenced who they like/respect. Same for NBA fans but there are a lot more neutral NBA fans than neutral players</p>

I&rsquo;d bet your left nut that if AI had a couple rings and MVP&rsquo;s he&rsquo;d be pushed into these debates as well. Gary Payton would not because he does not have the proper playing style. I&rsquo;ve definitely seen a couple posts saying Curry is the GOAT or it&rsquo;s between him and MJ. I also don&rsquo;t think Kobe sucks. I think he&rsquo;s the &ldquo;gatekeeper&rdquo; to top 10. I think players overrate him because of his game and personality. I think redditors hate on him partly in response to the push Kobe&rsquo;s been getting since his death and because they&rsquo;re dumb haters in general.</p>

<p>obviously if you put 6 centers in your top 10, centers dominate.  You don&rsquo;t have to do that lol.

<p>I don&rsquo;t have an educated horse in this race, but I&rsquo;ve always figured that one of the things that made Mike another level of icon was that he on <em>top</em> of the GOAT level achievements also is a candidate for the most aesthetically pleasing player of all time. He was a good-looking dude, but his <em>game</em> was <em>beautiful</em>.</p>

Five rings, 81 points in a game, 18 All-Star selections, 15 All-NBA teams, and 12 All-Defensive teams. He’s fourth all-time in scoring. His advanced stats like PER and VORP show his impact.

      <label for="l7qltak" class="commentText"><p>100% yup lol. Kobe was a better defender and a more complete offensive threat. And he did it in what was by far the lowest scoring era in NBA history. I know it’s not a popular opinion so whatever, but yes, Kobe was a better basketball player than LeBron.</p>

      <label for="l7qy03l" class="commentText"><p>Not even close. Kobe hovered just above league average TS for his career. His best years he was 4% better than league average. Lebron&rsquo;s best years he was 11% better.</p>

<p>Lebron is a way better rim protector and perimeter defender. Lebron has actually locked up stars Kobe did not.</p>

<p>Is playmaking and passing not part of offense? Lebron doubles up Kobe in assists. Lebron is straight up a better 3 point shooter.</p>

Then you say Kobe played in the lowest scoring ever as if Lebron wasn’t drafted in 2003. I honestly think fans who dislike Lebron never got to actually see him in his prime and believe the Lebron they’ve been seeing for the last 6 years is him at his best. </p>

      <label for="l7ru67t" class="commentText"><p>I don’t see how anyone can say peak Kobe was better than 2013 Lebron. I definitely don’t see how anyone can say Kobe’s career was better than Lebrons. I think the whole “mamba mentality” and “clutch gene” is stupid and holds too much weight when considering who’s better. Give them identical teammates and Lebron is taking the team further because he’s just a better overall player that does almost everything better. I think too many fans took Lebron for granted. They never got to actually see him play because they were always looking for something negative. When he retires and they have his 5 hour long highlight video (Bron probably had the best highlights out of anyone) everyone will just say “Damn”. </p>

      <label for="l7sohqc" class="commentText"><p>Jerry West 100%.</p>

<p>West was a better scorer in a worse era for guards, in an era where he lost a ton of points due to no 3-point line, and a significantly better shooter.</p>

<p>He was significantly more clutch than Kobe (Kobe was average at best, they named the award after West).</p>

<p>West was, at worst, equal on defense, as he was regarded as the best defender among guards in his era.</p>

<p>West was a much better teammate than Kobe (Kobe drove two hall of fame centers, Shaq and Dwight, out, alienated teammates the first half of his career, and spent his last couple of years hogging the offense when he clearly wasn&rsquo;t that guy anymore).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve asked this question before and no one has been able to answer: What exactly was Kobe better at than West, definitively?</p>

<p>Also, while they weren&rsquo;t better players, Elgin Baylor and George Mikan were significantly more important Lakers.  Mikan was unquestionably The Guy in the league when he played and its biggest star by far, and the Lakers arguably would not exist without Baylor being a superstar as soon as he entered the league.  The team was on the verge of folding until Baylor came into the league and spiked attendance.</p>

Kobe? Kobe was a two-way beast, five-time champ, and could drop 81 on any given night. He did it with Shaq then proved he didn&rsquo;t need him. Look at Kobe’s footwork, the fadeaways, the relentless defense. He took over games in ways none of those guys did. Kobe&rsquo;s footwork was textbook, his mid-range game was unstoppable, and he was clutch when it mattered most. Advanced stats? How about Kobe&rsquo;s 2005-06 season where he posted a 28.0 PER, the highest since Jordan? His impact was immeasurable, carried mediocre teams to the playoffs, outworked everyone. Kobe wasn’t just a scorer; he was a complete player. Saying Kobe&rsquo;s not top-tier is what&rsquo;s delusional.</p>

Kobe’s 2005-06 season PER of 28 is elite, and he’s consistently top-tier in win shares and box plus-minus. He dropped 81 Sure, it happened once, but it shows his potential for dominance. His career average of 25 points per game over 20 seasons speaks volumes. Kobe’s impact goes beyond stats because it’s about his two-way play footwork and game changing moments.

<p>Every superstar has this. The difference is you don&rsquo;t have to mention it about them to build their case. The goat tier players had way more game changing moments and defensive plays than Kobe.</p>

      <label for="l7r2zun" class="commentText"><p>This is a super weird point to differentiate Kobe and Magic on. Kobe went to 7 finals and was top 5 in MVP <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> years from 2002-2013, that&rsquo;s slightly worse than Magic in that comparison but not a gap that suggests a significant gulf in quality or achievement.</p>

Bulls/Blazers, game 1, people said Jordan couldn&rsquo;t shoot 3s, he set the record at the time for most 3s in a half to shut them up.  He said later he didn&rsquo;t want to be a good 3-point shooter intentionally because it created a different mentality to wait for the shot rather than to attack.</p>

<p>Sure, Jordan was just out there missing shots because making them would give him a poor mentality. Yeah. Makes perfect sense. When he wanted to, he could just will them in.</p>

<p>Or, and consider this for a moment, he was a bad 3 point shooter. I&rsquo;m going to go with Occam&rsquo;s Razor on this one.</p>

<p>This is Jordan&rsquo;s interview, right after Game 1 where he set the 3-point record to prove a point.  And we know he did this to prove a point, because the &ldquo;better 3 point shooter than I choose to be&rdquo; quote came from before Game 1 when people were hyping up Drexler &amp;gt; Jordan cause of that, and everyone knows how competitive Jordan gets at things.</p>

<p>My point was, Jordan did not want to shoot threes, so he did not work on threes.  That did not mean that Jordan could not be a good 3-point shooter if he wanted.  He did not set himself up as much to take threes, he wasn&rsquo;t as aggressive at taking threes, he wasn&rsquo;t consistently positioning himself in the corner to shoot threes, or working designed plays to get himself open for three, and all that contributes to a lower percentage shot he didn&rsquo;t care about.  A lot of the offensive innovation that has lead to good 3-point shooting just didn&rsquo;t exist in Jordan&rsquo;s time, and the motivation to focus on this skill wasn&rsquo;t there.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean if he was plopped into the modern era, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do so.</p>

<p>As an example of this, go look back at Larry Bird, one of the consensus greatest shooters ever, and his early career.  First 5 years, Bird was a sub-30% shooter, one year averaging 21.2% from three.  Then he decides he&rsquo;s going to incorporate that shot into his arsenal, jumps up to a 40%+ shooter the rest of his career on increased volume.  He cared about the skill, so he changed his game, and became one of the best ever at it.  Living walking embodiment of a guy who missed 75% of his threes on purpose, then cared, and became elite.</p>

<p>And, to prove my point, go back and look at Jordan&rsquo;s career, and look at 89-90.  For the most part, Jordan took 1 three/game, and averaged under 30% from three.  Yet, 89-90, his attempts increased to 3/game, and again minus modern rules and offensive sets, shot 37.6% from three that year, 21st in the League that year in 3 point percentage (that would equate to 41.4% this year).  So yes, Jordan could just will them in at a much higher rate when he wanted to, and there&rsquo;s evidence of a year without the shortened line of him doing so.</p>

<p>This is bullshit. Kobe wanted to shoot a three every time he took a three, and his percentage wasn&rsquo;t very good.</p>

Pop basically dared Lebron to shoot during their Finals meetings because it&rsquo;s better to let Lebron shoot where he wasn&rsquo;t very good at, than let him drive to the basket where he was some insane 70+ FG%. MJ came into the league already a complete player, no weaknesses other than size which was only a problem when he thought he could guard Magic. otherwise there was no gameplan against him.</p>

<p>and then Kobe&rsquo;s weakness was himself lol. he once said to Phil Jackson that the triangle was boring because it didn&rsquo;t push him to use his entire skill set.</p>

      <label for="l7s7233" class="commentText"><p>I doubt rookie scottie made so much of a difference to make the bulls jump up to a 50 win team when he wasn&rsquo;t some star from the start.</p>

<p>In reality the bulls were awful when Jordan joined, then he was hurt for most of year 2. Then they improved a little in year 3. Then year 4 is where they really started making strides even before Scottie and Horace truly developed as players. If you want to give all the credit to 8ppg pippen who was playing about 21minutes then be my guest but its not really genuine.</p>

<p>Scottie had the advantage of coming to a team where they had a guy that was already dominating statistically and being acknowledged by all the greats of that time. Then he was on a rockets team that had legends of their own even if they weren&rsquo;t in their prime. Then that blazer team was pretty much loaded with very good talent(two deep vs too deep was one of the best conference series around)</p>

<p>While Jordan was trying to carry a weak wizard team and he was doing pretty well until he got injured and tried to play through it.</p>

<p>I like Scottie and he was super necessary to the bulls success but he&rsquo;s used in a lot of ingenuine arguments to try and detract from Michael. So what you&rsquo;re saying is true on paper but it lacks a lot of context to it.</p>

      <label for="l7rcacf" class="commentText"><p>Here&rsquo;s the thing with Kobe: People could slow him down A LOT in key match-ups.</p>

<p>I realize we see him with rose tinted glasses since his passing, but the dude shot .381 against Tayshuan Prince int he NBA finals and kept jacking up shots like it was going out of style when he should have been feeding Shaq, who was shooting over .600 from the field. Then after he has this romantic notion that if you are cold you should just keep shooting to show your confidence. That exact attitude is why the Lakers lost to the Pistons in 04.</p>

<p>In 03, Bruce Bowen had him shooting .434.</p>

<p>Hell, Kendall Gill and Anthony Peeler has him shooting .430 that same year.</p>

<p>Against the Pacers in his first title, Reggie Miller held him to .367 from the floor.</p>

<p>And Kobe has NEVER won a championship with a team that he led in winshares. from 00-02, Shaq led the Lakers in winshares. In 09 and 10, Gasol led the Lakers in winshares.</p>

<p>Kobe is certainly a great player: The second best shooting guard to every play the game. Without a doubt.</p>

<p>And he&rsquo;s an icon. Sure.</p>

<p>And he&rsquo;s put up great PERSONAL stats, but when he did his most impressive personal stats, his team was getting bounced in the first round.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s never won a playoff series without at least one other All Star.</p>

<p>When you really look at what he needed around him to compete (and I saw &lsquo;compete&rsquo; not win a title), he just NEVER did anything note worthy within a team context unless he had amazing players around him. \</p>

<p>And when you see how Kobe REPEATEDLY got slowed down to a snail&rsquo;s pace in MULTIPLE series where he was expect to come up big, it&rsquo;s clear that Shaq was the driving force in LA for those first 4 finals appearances, and that Kobe couldn&rsquo;t get even get out of the first round, relegating him to Melo/T-Mac status, unless he had another All NBA player alongside him.</p>

      <label for="l7rdt9j" class="commentText"><p>Slowing Kobe down? Seriously? He had entire defenses keyed on him. Yeah, he shot .381 against Prince, but he still averaged 22.6 points, 4.4 assists, and 2.2 steals that series. And Shaq? Sure, Shaq was dominant but defenses double-teamed him too, creating open looks for Kobe. That &ldquo;keep shooting&rdquo; attitude? That’s called confidence, and it won games, too. Bowen, Gill, Peeler, Miller who were all tough defenders, but Kobe still got his numbers. Kobe never led in win shares? Win shares aren’t everything. His impact went beyond stats. Gasol led in win shares because Kobe drew the defensive attention. Kobe&rsquo;s never won without another All-Star? Basketball’s a team game. Look at Jordan, LeBron and they all had help. Kobe’s 62 points in three quarters against Dallas, his 81 points, five rings those aren’t just personal stats, they’re game-changers. He did plenty within a team context leading by example, relentless work ethic. Shaq was a force, no doubt, but Kobe’s skill set, his mid-range game, footwork, and clutch performances were unmatched. Comparing him to Melo/T-Mac is absurd. They didn’t have his two-way impact or his championship pedigree. Kobe was a winner, plain and simple.</p>

      <label for="l7t5pce" class="commentText"><p>Yes. Seriously. And reading your comments, I don&rsquo;t think that you watched the series.</p>

<p>The Pistons relied largely on one-on-one defence with Shaq specifically so that they could double Kobe.</p>

<p>And yes, they did double Kobe, WHO STILL JACKED UP SHOTS because he was a ball hog.</p>

<p>He should have been averaging 8 apg that series. If he had, they would have won.</p>

<p>Jordan didn&rsquo;t get double-teamed by the Pistons: He got WHOLE-TEAM teamed by the Pistons and still shot .490 in 88, .460 in 89, and .467 in 90, and .535 in 91. AGAINST ONE OF THE BEST DEFENCES OF ALL THAT THAT FOCUSED THEIR ENTIRE DEFENCE AROUND HIIM.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the difference. Kobe had teams that were largely double-teaming Shaq and benefited from the gravity of Shaq and still could be slowed down.</p>

<p>And your &ldquo;but he averaged 22.&rdquo; Yeah. I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;stopped.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;slowed down.&rdquo; Yes, Kobe jacked up enough shots to have a decent ppg average, but his regulars season average was 24, and he was getting more minutes in the finals .</p>

<p>And yes, the T-Mac/Melo comparison is fair: Name me a season when Kobe didn&rsquo;t have Shaq or Paul where he had more team success than either T-Mac and Melo ever had.</p>

<p>I eagerly await for your reply, which will be &ldquo;There is not such season.&rdquo; Why?</p>

<p>Well&hellip; the reason is simple: Kobe never won a championship on a team where he was the winshare leader. He always needed somebody on his team to carry the load.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just a fact. Everything else is revisionist history. Kobe was a great PR guy, had great highlights, was a wonderful defender, a hard worker, and a very talented player. But he was also a ball hog and nearly uncoachable for the first 10 years of his career. He alienated teammates, put up great personal numbers, but wasn&rsquo;t the killer everybody seems to think he was because he was repeatedly slowed down by guys like Bowen, Miller, and Prince.</p>

<p>If LeBron were slowed down the way Kobe was in big match-ups and he only ever won on teams where somebody else was the winshare leader, we&rsquo;d never hear the end of it, and Skip Bayless would make sure of that.</p>

<p>But when it&rsquo;s Kobe, people just look the other way.</p>

<p>The dude wasn&rsquo;t a closer. Hell, he&rsquo;d have far fewer rings if Fisher didn&rsquo;t save the day against the Spurs or Robert Horry didn&rsquo;t pick up an offensive rebound from a Kobe miss and hit a three pointer. If Horry hadn&rsquo;t, by chance, picked up that rebound, the close highlight of that game would be Kobe bricking the biggest shot of his life.</p>

<p>But his ass was saved by Horry.</p>

      <label for="l7rel6v" class="commentText"><p>Top 5 is subjective, man. Comparing elite players is all about different circumstances. Kobe had different challenges and still thrived. Five rings, two without Shaq, 81 points in a game, fourth all-time scorer. He faced double and triple teams, played through injuries, and still dominated. KD and Curry respect him because they know what it takes. Different eras, different teams, different competition. Saying he’s hardly top 10 ignores all that.</p>
