      <p>&ldquo;It was like, we don&rsquo;t know how long this series is going to go on for, let&rsquo;s try to save him from himself because he was trying to play. So let&rsquo;s see if we can get through a game or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then when it was Game 5 at home, it was like, &lsquo;Hey, this might be it. I&rsquo;ve got to be out there.&rsquo; He was like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m playing.&rsquo; He overrode the medical team and was just like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m playing.&rsquo; Credit to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/zm_cox/status/1803435836131745807?t=6dDjEeZpEJ1Yq4exuUZzjw&amp;s=19" target="_blank">https://x.com/zm_cox/status/1803435836131745807?t=6dDjEeZpEJ1Yq4exuUZzjw&amp;s=19</a></p>

<p>Even if he couldn&rsquo;t play, Celtics fans would always have game 1. That made him a Boston legend.</p>

<p>He held up pretty well anyway. Boston pre-switched and then iced any ballscreens that they could to try and protect him.</p>

<p>Also shout out to Tillman who really held it down in game 3 to let Horford rest.</p>

<p>HE WAS A STUD IN DALLAS WHEN HEALTHY!! Luka-KP ran the most efficient offense in NBA history in 2020, it wasn&rsquo;t until KP tore his miniscus in the 20 NBA Playoffs that he started to struggle in Dallas.</p>

<p>No lol. Dallas was on pace to be a 50ish win team in the 19-20 season when KP was healthy and had a real shot at beating the Clippers in the 2020 playoffs until KP tore his miniscus. This idea that KP struggles in Dallas from day 1 is absurd, he didn&rsquo;t start to struggle until he tore his miniscus which hindered his movement.</p>

On any other team earning $36 million of their cap, he would be viewed as a big issue as to why they couldn’t win it all with the same reputation. Not really sure what’s changed.

<p>The only argument I think you have against the Phoenix lineup is the defense. I’m well aware Boston is a much better team than both of these.</p>

The only 7ft all-star unicorn who can beat his former team in the finals, singlehandedly demolishing them in the 1st quarter of game 1, while also making his former team look smart for trading him for Spencer Dinwiddie and a $20m aav lead weight.</p>

<p>Great player, great competitor, but his ideal fit is as a bonus all-star on an all-star team in a weak conference that can win without him.</p>

<p>Edit: my bad guys. The Celtics would have gotten swept by the Mavs if Porzingis did not play limited minutes in 3 games in the finals. Better?</p>

Yeah he looked bad but the spacing he provided offensively was immediately noticeable and while I don’t think he had many blocks if any at all but you could tell he affected some shots at the rim and made some drivers kick out instead. After all his playing time he was +8</p>

<p>Also his appearance messed up the Mavs and they tried to foul him as much as possible to physically challenge, but he made the dunk at 4th quarter to prove them wrong.</p>

<p>Other than small ball mess and these 3 pointers the performance Celtics put was almost perfect.</p>
