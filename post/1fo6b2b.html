      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fo6b2b/almost_every_nba_locker_room_jj_reddick_was_in/"><p>Almost every NBA locker room JJ Reddick was in during his career was weirdly dysfunctional</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Everybody knows and has acknowledged Reddick has no coaching experience. I don&rsquo;t think that automatically means he&rsquo;ll be bad as a lot of coaching is really about leadership as much as tactics. But was JJ a good leader in his NBA career?</p>

<p>Someone like Steve Kerr could go into his first coaching job saying he won championships with and had the respect of Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan as well as coaches Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich. Pat Riley could say he was part of the team that won 33 games in a row and the championship with Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain. What are the historic moments and teams Reddick has been a part of? Saying he was there to learn from Doc Rivers what not to do when the Clippers collapsed against Josh Smith and Corey Brewer is pretty uninspiring.</p>

<p>Wherever he went in his NBA career, the locker rooms were characterized by dysfunction or a lack of leadership. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s his fault. By all accounts he himself was a consummate professional, but the track record is pretty odd when you look at it. In general his player archetype aren&rsquo;t influential leaders in the locker room for whatever reason and the ones he was in almost always had some sort of public drama.</p>

<ul>
<li>His career starts in Orlando and culminates in the &ldquo;Dwightmare&rdquo; saga, where a discontent Dwight Howard messes up team chemistry and it ends with both the coach fired and the star traded</li>
<li>His next stop is the Lob City Clippers, which was well known for how much the best players grew to dislike each other amid perennial playoff disappointment. One funny parallel to Reddick&rsquo;s current situation is Doc Rivers signing his son to the team during that time and making things uncomfortable (for fun google &ldquo;Blake Griffin imitates Austin Rivers&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Following that he goes to the Sixers. This is also a pretty turbulent time for the Sixers as it includes Fultz&rsquo; weird rookie year, Colangelo&rsquo;s twitter burner incident, and the Jimmy Butler trade. That said, I think his shooting actually holds the Simmons-Embiid pairing together for longer than it otherwise would have lasted.</li>
<li>He has a season and half with New Orleans, rookie Zion and the post AD trade Pelicans. The coach Alvin Gentry is fired after his first season there.</li>
<li>He is then traded to Dallas, in a season where the relationship between Luka, Porzingis, and the coach is not really working out. Following the season, Rick Carlisle resigns as coach after 13 years with the franchise.</li>
</ul>

<p>If nothing else this proves Reddick is used to navigating drama, but there&rsquo;s not a lot of evidence he can steer the ship back in the right direction. Maybe all those situations were unsalvageable but it will be interesting to see if things are different and how players will respond to him as an authority figure.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s Reddick&rsquo;s job now, right? That&rsquo;s why I went looking for any evidence of him doing it. I&rsquo;ve seen people speculate about what schemes or tactics he&rsquo;ll use but the first question I&rsquo;m curious about is from where will he derive his authority and command respect.</p>

<p>Most player turned coaches can rely on having been a point guard or a championship winning role player or both. Reddick doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of resume so it seems he&rsquo;s going to have to get there the way a Spoelstra or Thibs did by grinding tape, despite being a former player.</p>

That&rsquo;s why I say it&rsquo;s more weird than anything.

If Reddick tries to invoke his experience successfully playing a 2 man game with Ben Simmons it doesn&rsquo;t hit the same.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Reddick is the cause of dysfunction, nor Kerr the cause of success. It&rsquo;s possible their circumstances as players are entirely due to luck outside their control. But as a result, their first hand experiences as players and who they played with and for lend very different levels of credibility.</p>

<p>Yeah thats what i wanted to say&hellip;but i couldnt help but take a jab at JJ for fun lol.</p>

<p>Maybe they all signed JJ because they KNEW they had locker room issues and thought his leadership could help. </p>

<p>I mean, even if he himself was positive and being a “leader” for rookies and whatnot, but if the captain and leaders of the team were sulking and being a drama queen, then the locker room will be toxic. Doesn’t matter what the role players individually think, felt or behave.</p>

At the very, very end, he was pissed for the end of a season because the Pelicans traded him to Dallas after saying they&rsquo;d only trade him close to his Brooklyn home or release him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure his best teams in L.A. and Philly had whatever issues due to the star, big money guys and their ultimate failures as wannabe contenders.</p>

      <label for="looh6zc" class="commentText"><p>Anyone who thinks JJ will be a good coach is a fool. He’s already demonstrated that he’s a liar, saying Bronny earned his spot was him lying thru his damn teeth like people are stupid. He’s only shown that he can draw up plays (that may or may not even work) but not shown he can handle egos and being a calming presence when things go left (he’s pretty arrogant and shown to have an ego as well). Then there’s the racial allegations, which will make certain players off rip be down on him. All it takes is a bad stretch of basketball for that Lakers team and the locker room will explode with drama (they have a stretch of good opponents to start the season). If they start out dropping games will JJ have the ability to keep them together and focused. I highly doubt it, not only because of his ability as coach but the fact that LeQueen will be micromanaging the team as well behind the scenes. It won’t be good and if it goes left what will LeQueen do or say? Throw JJ under the bus or defend him publicly? Time will tell, I see it going bad tho</p>
