      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fo6b2b/almost_every_nba_locker_room_jj_reddick_was_in/"><p>Almost every NBA locker room JJ Reddick was in during his career was weirdly dysfunctional</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Everybody knows and has acknowledged Reddick has no coaching experience. I don&rsquo;t think that automatically means he&rsquo;ll be bad as a lot of coaching is really about leadership as much as tactics. But was JJ a good leader in his NBA career?</p>

<p>Someone like Steve Kerr could go into his first coaching job saying he won championships with and had the respect of Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan as well as coaches Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich. Pat Riley could say he was part of the team that won 33 games in a row and the championship with Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain. What are the historic moments and teams Reddick has been a part of? Saying he was there to learn from Doc Rivers what not to do when the Clippers collapsed against Josh Smith and Corey Brewer is pretty uninspiring.</p>

<p>Wherever he went in his NBA career, the locker rooms were characterized by dysfunction or a lack of leadership. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s his fault. By all accounts he himself was a consummate professional, but the track record is pretty odd when you look at it. In general his player archetype aren&rsquo;t influential leaders in the locker room for whatever reason and the ones he was in almost always had some sort of public drama.</p>

<ul>
<li>His career starts in Orlando and culminates in the &ldquo;Dwightmare&rdquo; saga, where a discontent Dwight Howard messes up team chemistry and it ends with both the coach fired and the star traded</li>
<li>His next stop is the Lob City Clippers, which was well known for how much the best players grew to dislike each other amid perennial playoff disappointment. One funny parallel to Reddick&rsquo;s current situation is Doc Rivers signing his son to the team during that time and making things uncomfortable (for fun google &ldquo;Blake Griffin imitates Austin Rivers&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Following that he goes to the Sixers. This is also a pretty turbulent time for the Sixers as it includes Fultz&rsquo; weird rookie year, Colangelo&rsquo;s twitter burner incident, and the Jimmy Butler trade. That said, I think his shooting actually holds the Simmons-Embiid pairing together for longer than it otherwise would have lasted.</li>
<li>He has a season and half with New Orleans, rookie Zion and the post AD trade Pelicans. The coach Alvin Gentry is fired after his first season there.</li>
<li>He is then traded to Dallas, in a season where the relationship between Luka, Porzingis, and the coach is not really working out. Following the season, Rick Carlisle resigns as coach after 13 years with the franchise.</li>
</ul>

<p>If nothing else this proves Reddick is used to navigating drama, but there&rsquo;s not a lot of evidence he can steer the ship back in the right direction. Maybe all those situations were unsalvageable but it will be interesting to see if things are different and how players will respond to him as an authority figure.</p>

      <label for="lonpgko" class="commentText"><p>Because he never was good enough. Usually leaders are long standing successful stars or the  franchise loyalist like Haslem. It’s hard to be a leader in a room full of super talented more successful athletes.</p>

<p>No one knows how good of a coach he will be since he’s never done it. Im not expecting shit, but I’m happy to move on from Darvin Ham.</p>

<p>Interesting post, thanks for putting it up. While I agree JJ was never at the center of these dramas, I do think he contributes to a locker room that &ldquo;speaks out&rdquo; &hellip;</p>
