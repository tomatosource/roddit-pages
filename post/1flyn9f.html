      <p>Let&rsquo;s see how good r/nba in evaluating players in peak vs peak.</p>

<p>Clippers Cp3 VS Current SGA</p>

<p>Both two way point guards</p>

<p>With Cp3 being the better passer. And SGA the better scorer.</p>

<p>But who do you think is the better basketball player skills wise?</p>

      <label for="lo6jsh9" class="commentText"><p>There are very few players I would put above CP3 from a skill standpoint. SGA is looking pretty damn good and can certainly become better than CP3, but as of today, I will take CP3 almost every time.</p>

<p>I know a lot of fans like to clown on CP3 for “chokes”, but I honestly feel he only choked that Clippers Houston series.</p>

      <label for="lo74bz8" class="commentText"><p>Honestly his only REAL choke was 2 mins vs OKC (which also includes a few blunders from the refs if we&rsquo;re being completely fair), and game 7 vs the Jazz in 2017 (absolute trash after having one of his best series ever)</p>

<p>Him and Blake were the only ones with their heads on vs Houston that season through games 5-7 and CP3 was coming off that hamstring strain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to see people choosing CP3 in these comps because he was honestly an incredible player for a very long time and I always thought he was very underrated relative to how good he was. He brought the Draymond level intangibles but could also fill up a box score and he had a very long time prime (his average ws/48 from 2008-2018 was better than most star players single season highs) massive floor raiser and great defensively with all those all-nba defence.</p>

<p>As a massive fan of his, these sort of questions are truly no brainers. Even though I think of SGA very very highly too.</p>

      <label for="lo6nqoi" class="commentText"><p>They’re different players. SGA scores more and looks for his shot more so his stats will look more gaudy.</p>

<p>CP3 never preferred to be the first option for scoring but his control of the game is second to maybe 2nd Cavs era Lebron for the 2010’s.</p>

<p>If you’re asking who’s the better player skill wise it’s pretty comfortably Chris Paul but I can see some teams preferring SGA to be a first option.</p>

      <label for="lo74kzv" class="commentText"><p>CP3 just controlled games like nobody else. Even if he’s only putting up like <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> he just has complete control over how the offense runs, nothing the defense did could force him into bad decisions. SGA is pretty similar in that way, and I think CP3 rubbed off on him a lot. They both basically never turn the ball over considering their usage. With all that being said it still has to be CP3, just an absolute master of the point guard position</p>

<p>He needs the ball to be the best floor general there ever is/was, control the pace.  It doesnt work so well with superstars who shine the brightest when they have the ball in their hands.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I think prime him wouldve worked best with specialized role players, and maybe even all the way, without another superstar.  A rebounding 3&amp;Ds team.</p>

He can play 1-3 comfortably. SGA is not even at his prime. He could get even better, maybe even this upcoming season.</p>

      <label for="lo6ramd" class="commentText"><p>I’d say skill-wise SGA is much better. Just by watching his movement, his ability to create his own shot, handle, drive, etc, he does everything either elite or decent. The eye test favors SGA. CP3 is my favorite player all time though and if I was a GM and had the choice of either prime CP3 or SGA, CP3 would be the obvious choice</p>
