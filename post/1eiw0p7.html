<p>What he doesn’t have is that narrative championships as the clear #1 with teams built around him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately every other organization than the warriors (and Kevin has some blame on this too), has done a horrible surrounding KD with shooters to provide spacing on the floor. So he’s never had the luxury of having a team properly built around him.</p>

<p>Like can you imagine prime KD on a team built around him like Tatum on the Celtics? It would be nasty work.</p>

It’s not like he forced his way out or anything either, he was a free agent that signed for a team with cap space.</p>

<p>Yeah, it made the NBA boring for a couple seasons. But I don’t really blame KD for that.</p>

<p>I think it’s because for like 75% of young people that follow the NBA, they don’t actually watch or enjoy the sport of basketball. It’s just an outlet to hate on players they don’t like, or drum up drama. It’s one big soap opera for them.</p>

That’s why ESPN and the like puts out as much bullshit as they do - because people eat it up. Tim Legler explaining the  offensive sets that were being run last night is never going to be as popular as Stephen A screaming his head off about “legacy” and “aura”.</p>

<p>The NBA is a soap opera for men because fans WANT it to be a soap opera for men.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most of the best players now in the NBA are foreign</p></li>

<li><p>Most of the current top players in the NBA under 30 haven’t switched teams or formed super teams and aren’t demanding trades</p></li>

<li><p>Most of the current top players in the NBA under 30 are either drama free or the media doesn’t consider their drama interesting enough to talk about</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We’re going to see a real return to <em>basketball</em> going forward. Interested to see how many people remain interested in the sport then, I know I will still.</p>

      <label for="lgbmigd" class="commentText"><p>Makes sense. 10-12 years ago when these kids were young and becoming NBA fans LeBron was enemy #1 in basketball and KD was Americas sweetheart lmao. The 4-5 years after that (2014-2019) there was legit arguments about KD being a better player than LeBron. Then it all fell apart after we know what.</p>

      <label for="lgap2ik" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s such a cool relationship arc for Ant with KD. He’s talked about KD being his favorite player as long as he’s been in the NBA. To go from looking up to KD his entire life to going toe to toe and trash talking him (seemingly to KD’s delight) in a sweep in the playoffs to now being teammates on the Olympic team and having him as a mentor at 22. That’s just so cool</p>

      <label for="lg9pidj" class="commentText"><p>Of all sports, basketball fans are closest for players to hear them. Fans (just like the players) love to trash talk, especially at the opposing team’s star players. It fuels the fans when the players react, and they can be relentless at that point. KD meets all the criteria to receive the fans’ trash talk, and is the first target in ALL of his opposing arenas.
 That being said, I respect his floor game, I think he is a good person, his teammates like him and he is headed for the HOF.
 He got 2 chips with GS (and almost a 3rd), but he wanted to build his own superteam, and he’s finding out it’s not as easy as it seems. He’s still chasing it and his time is running out to get it done.
  I loved having him around when he was a member of my favorite team. But now that he is a visiting team member, I will still trash talk him during the 48 minutes of game time. Never anything personal, just hoop trash. If I ran into him during the other 23 hours and 12 minutes of the day, I’m sure I would be star struck, respectful and in awe.</p>

People seem to always forget that he didn’t get his first ring in OKC because he faced Lebrons super team Heat.  If Lebron never joined the Heat and KD won his first ring in 2012 maybe things are completely different and he never switches teams.</p>

Whether it&rsquo;s injuries, or weak teams, etc.  Most of it shouldn&rsquo;t affect the convo with fans tbh.
The only asterisk that i think matters is ring-chasing in their primes thru FA. Injures, weak teams in the finals are something we can&rsquo;t control.</p>

      <label for="lgbjn41" class="commentText"><p>Kinda a different topic or at least a very different way to go about what I was talking about haha. I agree it can be frustrating some years but there has been 6 straight different champs, and I wouldn’t call the Nuggets, Warriors (in 2022), Bucks, Lakers or Raptors super teams and they were certainly not overwhelming favorites. You can’t say that for the NFL.</p>

      <label for="lgan63f" class="commentText"><p>Maybe it’s not on your radar because it’s admittedly not as popular but UFC is way worse. Fans argue guys shouldn’t get title shots/main events because they aren’t good at self promotion or because they find their fight style boring.</p>

<p>As an analogy imagine on a day during the the season the scheduled worked out thay there weren’t a big market or teams that are legitimate title contender teams playing. People on the UFC sub were argue you’re wasting your time by watching and that the NBA is fucking up by televising the games because the ratings will be low. A non insignificant part of UFC fans make that argument about some of the free cards. They admit they  refuse to watch up and comers, which means they don’t get as popular, which feeds the beast of the UFC favoring big names over good matchups.</p>

<p>You know how every playoffs people throughout conspiracies that the NBA is reffing differently to get big market teams to advance for ratings? Some UFC fans would openly cheer for that.
There’s no matchmaking in the NBA so a team isn’t going to get passed up for a title shot because they shoot too many free throws.</p>

<p>And to top it all of a lot of them are super aggro because they confuse being into fighting with being able to fight.</p>

<p>People just dont view the 2 rings and as high as they would for most players. But its still higher than 0.</p>

      <label for="lgakvcl" class="commentText"><p>KD would be in the convo of Barkley, Stockton, and Malone if he was to become a lifer in OKC w/no rings. That&rsquo;s what top 20? So he moved up 5 spots by ring-chasing to GSW (top 15-20). However, if he was to win 1 chip in OKC, it catapults him into top (10-15) like Dirk&rsquo;s 2011 Finals Run.  Like i said, he was too insecure about not winning one that he made a &ldquo;weak&rsquo; move. Even if he had won one elsewhere, he would be in the same place legacy wise he is currently with 2x GSW chips.</p>

<p>I honestly think it was the right decision. KD’s game was well suited for Golden State and he wanted to win. He also won the FMVPs so it’s not like he got carried. Don’t really have any qualms about him joining especially since we are 8 years out at this point. Fans just need to accept what happened.</p>

It’s common for greats to be sensitive to what’s being said around them and about them. And the aforementioned only turns that criticism into fuel. Jordan would make stuff up in his mind to get himself going for crying out loud! I’m not mad at KD for going back and forth with randos because it doesn’t affect his game negatively.</p>

      <label for="lgb3g2h" class="commentText"><p>That CP/Lakers situation was just weird as hell. Stern was the temporary team owner and he didn&rsquo;t want to trade a superstar like CP for a package that would make the Hornets a low seed playoff team. The Lakers package was really good, but it wasn&rsquo;t great. The Clippers package was kinda ass but it included a first round pick, so the Hornets could enter a rebuild with an extra pick instead of letting CP walk in free agency or taking the Lakers package and ending up in purgatory. They ended up winning the lottery and drafting AD (probably rigged tbh), so from an ownership standpoint it was definitely the right choice in hindsight.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, that helped LeBron&rsquo;s narrative since it was no longer the most cowardly free agency decision of all time, but it also prevented him from winning any more championships in Cleveland.</p>

<p>And he took a paycut. And he announced it on Live TV making it a spectacle. And he said not 3 not 4 not 5 not 6 not 7 Rings, which was true because they only won 2 lol.</p>

<p>LeBron was much worse.</p>

<p>Wizards sucked.</p>

<p>What does Drake have to do with winning, and why do people pretend like Toronto is appealing to Free Agents?</p>

<p>Westbrook’s “revenge” season proved why he had to leave. Staying wasn’t an option.</p>

<p>Spurs are the best argument, but how is joining a 67 win dynasty team any better than GSW? Playing for Pop was appealing like playing in the GSW system was.</p>

<p>Don’t blame KD for the cap situation. Don’t blame KD for GSW being the best option by far.</p>

<p>Love KD but man you do not sound humbled.</p>

<p>Edit: okay I’ve watched again. I think what he means to say is “I hear a lot of hate from people and it feels bad but when I talk to people that I respect and hear that they appreciate and respect me and what I’ve done it makes me proud of who I am.” Idk how the word humbling got in there cause it’s kind of the opposite of that but I see what he’s saying.</p>

Im not hating just crazy how one of the best players of all time cares so much about haters.</p>

We build up and deify these athletes as gods and tear them down when they don&rsquo;t meet our arbitrary expectations. It&rsquo;s why I respect KD for actually clapping back at people because he&rsquo;s responding to people like a normal ass human lol.</p>
