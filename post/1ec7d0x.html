</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>The attention he attracted was &ldquo;very frustrating&rdquo; for the players to see, and his alleged star treatment caused friction among the team, which went 0-5 to start the tournament, per a Lakers insider.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That kind of tension didn’t help the group of players to build chemistry,&rdquo; said the source, who noted they have &ldquo;nothing against&rdquo; Bronny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you could feel that there was no unity [between] this group of guys as Bronny was the main guy and the others didn’t feel that it was right, that he deserved that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with dealing with Bronny’s attention and treatment, plenty of the other young guys that are trying to make the roster for next season couldn’t show their best side and show their A game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ended up being very frustrated because I was never put in the best situation, or even put in some plays or game plans because they wanted Bronny to show his skills and shine,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you talk to any other player that was part of the roster of the California Classic and the Summer League, most of them would tell you the same thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tensions were visible, and pretty much we were all thinking about the end of the Summer League to get out of here and focus on our next step in our careers.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lexy1wp" class="commentText"><p>thats definitely a fair sentiment, but it&rsquo;s not even like Bronny took away that many shots from other players. he&rsquo;d hardly shoot most of the initial games. not being able to show your A game on the court because Bronny is getting &ldquo;attention&rdquo; off the court, doesnt make too much sense imo</p>

<p>if i were that Lakers insider/summer league player, id be more frustrated at Blake Hinson for chucking up 3s whenever he touched the ball, for example</p>

      <label for="lexzgfi" class="commentText"><p>This is exactly what I said. Bronny had a limited role and by the end of sl played it very solidly. Kuhse, Lewis and Hinson were shot chucking and ball hogging. What does their crap game gotta do with bronny. Hell he looked more like a role player than any of those guys and never really forced many shots or ball hogged at all or had any plays ran for him. Like what happened to logic?</p>

      <label for="ley0wbp" class="commentText"><p>Exactly I know what I watched. Bronny was literally iced out of the offense for multiple possessions by the shot chuckers. And he looked like an infinitely more viable role player (because the best most these guys will be is a role player) than most of that roster because he had attention to detail on things like defense</p>

I would hope the Lakers know they have to put extra effort into making everyone feel like a part of the team but some people should also understand this isn’t college anymore and things may not go according to plan.</p>

<p>They are trying to make the NBA roster. It’s been their dream and they’ve worked so hard to get where they are now. Harder than Bronny has. And having unity as a team, can make the team/players perform better. You really are naive to all this.</p>

<p>Bronny had a pretty limited role offensively and at least towards the end was one of the most reliable players on that roster that you could actually see potentially having a role outside Knecht</p>

Without the James name he&rsquo;s coming back to USC net season if he even got into USC without his name.  It is Bronny&rsquo;s fault for taking the easy way out and getting paid by his dad, as opposed to coming out of college when he was ready.  Yes lots of rich families do this, but before they get their son a job in finance the kids needs to finish their college careers at Standford, Yale etc before being given the jobs.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s like&hellip; kind of the point of summer league?  It&rsquo;s mainly for undrafted/unsigned players to have a chance at proving they might have some talent worth signing a 10day or 2way contract.  Teams use it to get their rookies some reps but without the guys hunting for a contract there&rsquo;d be no league for the rookies to practice in.</p>

Caruso stated it best, they arent looking for ceo&rsquo;s theyre looking for janitors. Thats where caruso was discovered. Look at vander blue, dude is mvp of gleague yet couldn&rsquo;t get on any team cause all he can do is score. Trying to blame the kid that was literally only one of the guys that tried to do other things is hilarious. If they hustled or even tried on D, they would have gotten a look by nba teams by now</p>

In the article the anonymous player said he was upset because plays were being drawn for Bronny to showcase his skills (which I highly doubt it was skewed towards only Bronny) but the majority of summer league teams will draw up plays for the players they drafted because…..that’s the point of summer league for the drafted rookies.

<p>Jogging back on defense or on offense not attacking, settling for contested long shots instead of cutting to open space near the hoop, not making the pass and settling for a contested shot, bad screen navigation, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;deferring&rdquo; to you?</p>

<p>Dude was straight up cheeks at the start. He looked like someone who knew he had a guaranteed spot with the team regardless of what he did. He looked amazing in the last two games when he finally showed the BBIQ he inherited from his dad. That&rsquo;s when he looked like a proper second-round pick.</p>

      <label for="ley0y0w" class="commentText"><p>okay i&rsquo;m watching the video</p>

<p>first play - he gets over the screen, contests - dude calls it an awful play cause he&rsquo;s not peak Kawhi getting around the screen</p>

<p>second play - RUN BACK - he picked up his man&hellip; what&hellip; he expected the 6&rsquo;1 guy to run to the middle and play C?</p>

<p>third play - he thought he could attack on the go, couldn&rsquo;t, passed it to a teammate in the corner - he&rsquo;s being yelled at cause that teammate turned it over&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m not watching anymore</p>
