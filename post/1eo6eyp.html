But the flip side of that is when he adjusts well and we win the game you gotta give the coaches a ton of credit</p>

<p>They paid for this in the 4th quarter, getting into the bonus early and having Joker play with 4 fouls.</p>

<p>This was an amazing game from the Serbians and they were pulling out all the stops to get a win here which they hadn&rsquo;t shown in the exhibition matches and frankly even the group stage.</p>

      <label for="lhbj3uo" class="commentText"><p>Europe was actually ahead on the 3 ball by quite a bit.</p>

<p>In 2001 the average 3 point attempt per game for teams in the NBA was 13.7. In Euroleague <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> teams attempted more per game that year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some older fans says that people used to criticize European ball for chucking too many 3&rsquo;s lol.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Europe has been catching up to America. A lot of these teams from smaller countries can field several quality NBA players now.</p>

<p>Look at Serbia. They have the best player in the world, Bogdanovic who is a quality role player, Jovic who just got playoff minutes, Micic who appeared in 60 games this year and averaged 11 pts and 6 assists in 30 games for Charlotte. And then you have a bunch of guys who were late picks and bounced around the NBA and Euroleague. You weren&rsquo;t getting that 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Now, the overall talent gap is still huge but it&rsquo;s at the point where good teamplay and roster construction can overcome it so in the future USA is gonna need to build smarter rosters. We&rsquo;ve already seen this on the last couple of world cups where USA couldn&rsquo;t win on talent alone along with some scares in the last two Olympics.</p>

      <label for="lhbk5dh" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I don’t mean to imply that the level of talent around the world hasn’t risen, it has. And shooting is obviously a talent too. I just think 3 pt variance is a larger component to winning now, and its importance is growing every year. And that’s the actual reason why these games are going to be scarier for Team USA.</p>

<p>When you just look at overall “talent”, USA is still far ahead of every team. But they have to commit to playing a style that emphasizes creating good looks from 3, and defending the 3, otherwise they’ll lose to anybody.. even South Sudan who scared them in the warm up games by getting hot from 3.</p>

      <label for="lhbqzow" class="commentText"><p>They went 0/9 from 3 in the 4th, after shooting 50% from behind the arch in the first three quarters.</p>

<p>Now, part of that was also the US tightening their defense, but Serbia went cold in the 4th. It’s a testament to how well they played in the other quarters that the US pulled it off by the skin of their teeth!</p>

<p>It was such a fun game to watch!</p>

      <label for="lhbp2zu" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but it wasn&rsquo;t just the shot making, the shots they were taking were easier. It looked like they were left open more in those first 3 quarters, felt like the defense kept either over committing for steals or trying to prevent backdoor cuts inside and then in the 4th they locked down and stayed with their man so the 3s were looking more contested.</p>

      <label for="lhcjmid" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know about that. I think in the end the US wore them out. They had plenty of open looks at the end but they were front rimming it indictive of tire legs. But I agree Serbia put themselves in foul trouble but that was also indicative of them trying to hamper a team that was bigger, stronger, and faster. They were pulling out all the tricks. Fouling a bunch and see what they could get an away with. Flopping a ton. They pulled all the tricks out. The foul trouble combined with having to chase US around all game, like you can see the panic in them when Curry had the ball…that is a tougo task because your fighting through screens and having to switch but the guy your switching off is still really fucking good so your still having to hedge And be physical. By design US seemed to give them semi open looks from deep knowing it is still not a high percentage shot and for the most part they were still some what contested props to serbia for having a scheme that is going to get you open looks. They did put more full court pressure in the 4th making it difficult to get into there sets and making them fight for it which wore on them. It is hard to beat the same team three times in a row…the US did that and they didn’t even play there best.</p>

<p>Spot on. I was saying the whole game USA going to make their move, and if they get within 5 it&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>Why? Once fatigue sets in late, legs get tired and those same 3&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t falling anymore&hellip;&hellip;now the talent disparity will show. Waaaaaaaaay too much talent to overcome&hellip;..nobody is guarding Steph on the perimeter.</p>

      <label for="lhbouu2" class="commentText"><p>Lebron and Steph inspire that kind of play. Steph is constantly moving but it hasn’t been until recently that guys realized they had to stop ball watching and start down screening for Steph as he whirls around the court. Lebron has always been pass-first until he needs to be aggressive.</p>

<p>I’m sure Boston hates the benching, but the reality is Tatum was a frustrating ball watcher and almost never cut or set screens. It was an offense killer. Who are you gonna sub him in for? KD? Bron? Or play him at guard? He wasn’t going to fill that role better than White, Jrue or Book.</p>

<p>Durant and KD love playing with Steph, and Embiid was as motivated as I’ve ever seen him last night. That screen he set for Steph was bone crushing and it was the first time I saw him actively seek out his screen, and timed it perfectly.</p>

<p>Booker is the perfect guy to use as a defensive specialist / play finisher - he just coached Klay Thompson for a decade.</p>

<p>Bam, ant, and White were all pretty bad.  Tatum could have easily taken any of their minutes.  But if you really want to be a stickler with positions Tatum at the very least could/should have played 4 next to AD instead of Bam.</p>

      <label for="lhc6sf9" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, IDK about this take.</p>

<p>I might not have <em>some</em> insights that any former player would have. However, if a former player declines to educate themselves on some very basic stats or watch the games, are we supposed to just take their words as gospel? If so, what are the limits?</p>

<p>Could a guy who had a 10-day contract in 2014 and has never watched an NBA game in 10 years still have better takes than someone who does player analysis backed up with a ton of stats and has watched 10 games a week for the last 10 years?</p>

<p>Obviously Chuck is a legend and will watch the occasional game, but mostly he&rsquo;s an entertainer who watches highlights and takes naps when the game is on.</p>

      <label for="lhc8f80" class="commentText"><p>I agree. Inside the NBA is entertainment. They hardly do any analysis. The fact that <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the people on the show are former players doesn’t somehow make that any less true. Being a former player doesn’t mean you’re gonna be able to be an analyst of the game. Especially when they don’t even watch most of the games.</p>

      <label for="lhcaror" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a balance. I think basically any NBA player that had a few years in the league could leave the bench for a studio, but the bare minimum requirement next to that resume is that they watch the games and when told stats contradict their assumptions, they don&rsquo;t dig in and refuse to believe them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s shocking how many former players become &ldquo;analysts&rdquo; but really all they do is talk shit and watch highlights.</p>

You can tell it takes the Americans a while to adjust to a ball that they don&rsquo;t normally play with. Then you add in the different rules and different officiating, and it&rsquo;s a lot of small advantages for euro players that add up.</p>

Not to imply that serbia &ldquo;lucked&rdquo; their way into that position, but if they played a 7 game series the margin of victory is probably gonna be larger than it was for this particular game. They were hot from 3 for 3 quarters, and part of that was team USA&rsquo;s defense but another part is just flat out hitting shots at a super high clip.</p>

      <label for="lhbffnx" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. Feel like I’m taking crazy pills people talking about how great TNT analysis is. They’re charismatic and that’s about it. They hate the modern game. Shaq hates every big man not named Giannis and somehow takes a slight anytime any of them are given a compliment. I also cringe every time Shaq unironically says “The others”. He’s so proud of that phrase too. They ALL talk generically about the game and say casual stuff like “they just wanted it more” or “they need to get that killer instinct”.  Basically if it’s not a star going off or a star letting people down they have no idea what to say. They’re also wayy behind on knowing who are the emerging 4th or 5th guys on a team and it’s because THEY DONT WATCH THE GAMES. And they brag about it too. Every time Chuck talks about how he can’t wait for another hockey playoff game cause he can’t stand the nba playoff game he just watched it’s like, alright why the fuck are you here then. Bunch of pampered babies. Ernie honestly is the only good one imo and that’s cause he’s able to keep the show from going off the rails.</p>

<p>It’s bad for the sport of basketball that the most popular basketball TV show is one that hates the game of basketball.</p>

<p>And don’t even get me started on the bus driver nonsense that this sub eats up</p>

      <label for="lhbh3dy" class="commentText"><p>As a Sixers fan it&rsquo;s so frustrating having their games on TNT because I have to hear about how Joel should &ldquo;play like a big man.&rdquo; When:</p>

<p>A: he posts up more than anyone not named Jokic. And:</p>

<p>B: any amount of the type of physicality that Shaq and Chuck are describing leads to flagrants.</p>

<p>They are always telling him to just bully the smaller guys seemingly not seeing that that leads to offensive fouls (mostly from flops), double teams, turnovers, and flagrants. The NBA does not guard big men of Joel&rsquo;s talent the way they did back when they were playing. And the rules certainly do not favor the big man.</p>

<p>Southgate has never won anything. He’s heralded basically for vibes alone but each and every team we needed a coaching masterclass against on the biggest stage, he shit the bed. It’s criminal that we couldn’t win against Italy, at home, with a lead. He turned some of the most exciting talents in world football into mundane, ineffectual players.</p>

<p>Kerr is an out and out winner. He was a winner as a player, he’s won as a head coach in the NBA and he’s more than likely about to be an Olympic champion head coach. The basketball he plays is fun to watch and it utilizes (mostly) his best players in their most influential spots on the floor.</p>

People are just mad about JT not getting minutes but dudes jumper is COOKED and hes not a good 3 point shooter, or deep 2 in this case, but seriously JT just doesnt play good team basketball and hes soft. His defense is great with NBA rules but he doesnt assert his power on defense with FIBA rules.</p>

      <label for="lhdasqv" class="commentText"><p>They put Steve Kerr in a catch 22. When they win and play well it’s because he has a loaded roster and when they play poorly it’s because he can’t coach. Like Gregg Popovich is probably the best coach of all time, but he was successful when he had David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili. You win when you have great players. They use that as criticism as if that’s not the case with every great coach in the history of the NBA.</p>

If you are of a certain age, and  you&rsquo;ll probably feel that if the US doesn&rsquo;t win by at least 20 it is a loss.  An actual loss is unbearable.  And logically I know international teams have gotten better and it sorta feels like the US is kinda back to just showing up and expecting to win, but the expectation doesn&rsquo;t go away.   If anything you dig in deeper as you get older, because for most of my life they almost always have won gold.  It&rsquo;s actually a hard place to be in for USA Basketball as far as public perception goes.  Literally the rest of the world wants you to lose, and if you don&rsquo;t win with enough style points your own country thinks you are bums and someone is to blame.  lol. Its not like these are series, anything can happen in a one and done.</p>

<p>Now, if the actual rotation is the best they can come up with can be discussed of course, but the general strategy is advantageous, I think.</p>

It’s just not possible with how good the world is now. This current team still absolutely has an argument for being a greater collection of overall talent tho, certainly more than a “hell no”</p>

<p>Especially when u take into account this team’s top 15 all time guys are much better than the DT’s overall, factoring in Magic and Larry’s declines. Plus this team doesn’t have a college player on it who had a worse career than every player on this team is likely to have except maybe DWhite.</p>

      <label for="lhcm8dv" class="commentText"><p>USA will always have the edge when it comes to talent, but FIBA basketball is different to the NBA and team work matters.</p>

<p>Ask yourself how does a German team with two bench players in Thesis, Schroder and a rising star in Franz beat the USA in the World Cup? That US team isn&rsquo;t the one we have now but still on paper are much more talented.</p>

<p>If you watch the semi against Serbia, the turnovers, allowing Serbia to get offensive rebounds, miscommunication on switches + the hot shooting by Serbia killed the US.</p>

I don’t understand why USA does so much hero ball, just imagine if that team ran a Pacers style offense with Haliburton getting some minutes and dishing dimes to lebron, ant, KD, Embiid</p>

      <label for="lhdgtd1" class="commentText"><p>While I understand that this isn&rsquo;t the same best of 7 format in the NBA finals that we are all used to, the whole strategy and planning goes onto Kerr and the coaching staff. I find it strange that team USA has such ridiculous depth to a point where people question the game time allocation of a single player, yet Serbia was able to compete and dominated for a good three quarters. Maybe this was the game plan, maybe not. Just an atypical situation to see given the depth of team USA.</p>

Other countries rosters are stacked with NBA talent now and we aren&rsquo;t just going to roll over everyone. World basketball is far more competitive than it&rsquo;s ever been. Some of these old guys need to stop living in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I really like Charles, but he does say some obviously wrong stuff sometimes. &ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t be tested&rdquo; is such a 1990s old-head take. The world has gotten so much better just in the last 20 years. Serbia played their A game and we had to play an A game to beat them.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand why we&rsquo;re all supposed to worry about Jason Tatum&rsquo;s feelings, Barkley keeps harping on the fact that Tatum is not getting playing time. As long as we&rsquo;re winning, who cares? Kerr and the other coaches are doing a wonderful job. This isn&rsquo;t about managing egos, it&rsquo;s about putting the best players on the floor at any given time based on the match ups.</p>

      <label for="lhfbxxq" class="commentText"><p>Lol, I love how these old heads pretend like we still in the 80s/90s when international ball was so clearly inferior its not even funny. But we live in a wildly different generation, the best players in the NBA (the American basketball league&hellip;) are actually Europeans and many of our best players are older than Barkley was when he retired lol.</p>

<p>Old heads love to pretend like the folks they played was the greatest collection of basketball talent ever assembled in a league, except like half the NBA in those eras wouldn&rsquo;t even get drafted in the second round of a modern NBA.</p>
