      <label for="lhbj3uo" class="commentText"><p>Europe was actually ahead on the 3 ball by quite a bit.</p>

<p>In 2001 the average 3 point attempt per game for teams in the NBA was 13.7. In Euroleague <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> teams attempted more per game that year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some older fans says that people used to criticize European ball for chucking too many 3&rsquo;s lol.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Europe has been catching up to America. A lot of these teams from smaller countries can field several quality NBA players now.</p>

<p>Look at Serbia. They have the best player in the world, Bogdanovic who is a quality role player, Jovic who just got playoff minutes, Micic who appeared in 60 games this year and averaged 11 pts and 6 assists in 30 games for Charlotte. And then you have a bunch of guys who were late picks and bounced around the NBA and Euroleague. You weren&rsquo;t getting that 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Now, the overall talent gap is still huge but it&rsquo;s at the point where good teamplay and roster construction can overcome it so in the future USA is gonna need to build smarter rosters. We&rsquo;ve already seen this on the last couple of world cups where USA couldn&rsquo;t win on talent alone along with some scares in the last two Olympics.</p>

      <label for="lhbk5dh" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I don’t mean to imply that the level of talent around the world hasn’t risen, it has. And shooting is obviously a talent too. I just think 3 pt variance is a larger component to winning now, and its importance is growing every year. And that’s the actual reason why these games are going to be scarier for Team USA.</p>

<p>When you just look at overall “talent”, USA is still far ahead of every team. But they have to commit to playing a style that emphasizes creating good looks from 3, and defending the 3, otherwise they’ll lose to anybody.. even South Sudan who scared them in the warm up games by getting hot from 3.</p>

Fast-forward 4 years when Durant and Curry are retired, and LeBron is maybe finally slowing down at 44 (j/k, not really… til he’s 90…), we’ll be fielding a team of all-stars, but will we see any other generational talents like these 3?</p>

<p>They paid for this in the 4th quarter, getting into the bonus early and having Joker play with 4 fouls.</p>

<p>This was an amazing game from the Serbians and they were pulling out all the stops to get a win here which they hadn&rsquo;t shown in the exhibition matches and frankly even the group stage.</p>

<p>I mean part of that &ldquo;elite shot making&rdquo; had to do with bad coaching choices too. Collapsing too much on Joker, not taking Ant out for Tatum when it was clear Ant was having a terrible game, bad rotations on defense&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lhbz45v" class="commentText"><p>I think the problem is that you are operating with this theoretical ideal of Tatum based on the aggregate of his production over his career, but simply put he is in a slump, has been a husk of his ideal, and has not been able to find a way to be as impactful as the other guys this Olympics.</p>

<p>If you have a lineup of guys that have been very impactful over the sample size of the Olympics being completely shut down, idk why you would want to go to the one guy who has not been impactful throughout the Olympics in hopes that he is this time?? Especially when you&rsquo;re down 17 in an elimination game??</p>

<p>I completely get that Tatum as we all know him is extremely impactful, but he just hasn&rsquo;t been that guy as of late. Probabilistically, it didn&rsquo;t make sense to go to him last game because one should be more confident guys like Ant, White, Jrue, AD, and Bam would get their shit together before Tatum due to the quality of their recent performances.</p>

<p>I still believe his length and rebounding would have been more of a net positive yesterday for Team USA over Ant who was visibly out of it and a nonfactor, but I&rsquo;ll admit that is some <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> hindsight in comparison.</p>

      <label for="lhc0opu" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. Additionally, Kerr did adjust. He only played the bench ~10 min and then he rightfully pulled them when they didn&rsquo;t have it going. He gave Ant an extra 3 min (~13 min) and then pulled him. Are people really that upset that Tatum ,who has struggled with his shot over the entire tournament and may not be sufficiently warmed up, didn&rsquo;t get those 3 minutes?</p>

      <label for="lhbp2zu" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but it wasn&rsquo;t just the shot making, the shots they were taking were easier. It looked like they were left open more in those first 3 quarters, felt like the defense kept either over committing for steals or trying to prevent backdoor cuts inside and then in the 4th they locked down and stayed with their man so the 3s were looking more contested.</p>

<p>Now, part of that was also the US tightening their defense, but Serbia went cold in the 4th. It’s a testament to how well they played in the other quarters that the US pulled it off by the skin of their teeth!</p>

<p>It was such a fun game to watch!</p>

Lebron was directing traffic a couple of times, but besides that, it was a lot of transition and exploiting mismatches which doesn&rsquo;t require a coach calling set plays.</p>

      <label for="lhbouu2" class="commentText"><p>Lebron and Steph inspire that kind of play. Steph is constantly moving but it hasn’t been until recently that guys realized they had to stop ball watching and start down screening for Steph as he whirls around the court. Lebron has always been pass-first until he needs to be aggressive.</p>

<p>I’m sure Boston hates the benching, but the reality is Tatum was a frustrating ball watcher and almost never cut or set screens. It was an offense killer. Who are you gonna sub him in for? KD? Bron? Or play him at guard? He wasn’t going to fill that role better than White, Jrue or Book.</p>

<p>Durant and KD love playing with Steph, and Embiid was as motivated as I’ve ever seen him last night. That screen he set for Steph was bone crushing and it was the first time I saw him actively seek out his screen, and timed it perfectly.</p>

<p>Booker is the perfect guy to use as a defensive specialist / play finisher - he just coached Klay Thompson for a decade.</p>

      <label for="lhbchek" class="commentText"><p>Where I struggle with yesterday’s game is the only adjustment Kerr made was just to put the closing 5 out there as long as possible. It was clear this was a game where Ant, Jrue, and DWhite didnt have it. Even Booker was out there doing cardio for the 4th quarter, while Melo has him clearing out for an ISO from his court side seat. The rigidity in not utilizing two great players in Tatum or Hali that could bring something different in that 2nd unit is just confusing. Playmaking from both, better switching perimeter defense and size from Tatum, maybe you get a flurry of shots from Hali. The idea that there’s never, ever going to be a chance for them to enter the game just baffles me.</p>

<p>In the same way Embiid was cold to start the game, you never know if trusting guys like Ant to turn it around is gonna be a good move or a bad move until you do it.</p>

      <label for="lhbzs50" class="commentText"><p>This isn&rsquo;t specific to you. But the odds that anyone knows for a fact that Steve Kerr made one and only one adjustment during that game are astronomically low. It&rsquo;s ok to criticize coaches, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wise to speak that certainly on specifics that we are all uninformed on. We weren&rsquo;t in the pregame meetings, the huddle, or Kerr&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>All we can do is speculate reasons why the rotation is what it is. Even that is tricky because he can make 100% correct decisions but if Steph is cold from 3 or Serbia hit 80% contested 3s then it looks like the wrong decision.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s highly unlikely that Tatum or Haliburton can navigate screens and chase off ball movement that Serbia was executing like Holiday, White, and Edwards. That&rsquo;s the most likely reason why you wouldn&rsquo;t want to play Tatum/Haliburton instead.</p>

<p>And it was a 40 minute game where AD/Bam/White played 10 or less minutes each. There are not enough minutes for 12 players every game to establish a rhythm and make an impact for the team.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the coaching staff is thinking good or bad. But just because we don&rsquo;t know the answer, doesn&rsquo;t mean they are wrong.</p>

      <label for="lhbffnx" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. Feel like I’m taking crazy pills people talking about how great TNT analysis is. They’re charismatic and that’s about it. They hate the modern game. Shaq hates every big man not named Giannis and somehow takes a slight anytime any of them are given a compliment. I also cringe every time Shaq unironically says “The others”. He’s so proud of that phrase too. They ALL talk generically about the game and say casual stuff like “they just wanted it more” or “they need to get that killer instinct”.  Basically if it’s not a star going off or a star letting people down they have no idea what to say. They’re also wayy behind on knowing who are the emerging 4th or 5th guys on a team and it’s because THEY DONT WATCH THE GAMES. And they brag about it too. Every time Chuck talks about how he can’t wait for another hockey playoff game cause he can’t stand the nba playoff game he just watched it’s like, alright why the fuck are you here then. Bunch of pampered babies. Ernie honestly is the only good one imo and that’s cause he’s able to keep the show from going off the rails.</p>

<p>It’s bad for the sport of basketball that the most popular basketball TV show is one that hates the game of basketball.</p>

      <label for="lhbh3dy" class="commentText"><p>As a Sixers fan it&rsquo;s so frustrating having their games on TNT because I have to hear about how Joel should &ldquo;play like a big man.&rdquo; When:</p>

<p>A: he posts up more than anyone not named Jokic. And:</p>

<p>B: any amount of the type of physicality that Shaq and Chuck are describing leads to flagrants.</p>

<p>They are always telling him to just bully the smaller guys seemingly not seeing that that leads to offensive fouls (mostly from flops), double teams, turnovers, and flagrants. The NBA does not guard big men of Joel&rsquo;s talent the way they did back when they were playing. And the rules certainly do not favor the big man.</p>

<p>Its very cursory analysis and about as deep as the morning dew.</p>

They never have anything positive to say about anything and really just contribute to the widespread problem in nba social media that is just criticizing and shitting on players. They have made the discourse so much more toxic than it has ever been.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The &ldquo;playing together for years&rdquo; is overblown. The best players on other teams - Jokic for Serbia, randos for Australia, SGA for Canada, Gianns for Greece, etc - all play most of their games in the NBA and play for the national team once a year at most.</p>

<p>The national coaching staff for other countries is more consistent and also follow a very specific gameplan of building around a particular style or playbooks, whereas the US Dream Team is basically ad-hoc every four years and has to be rebuilt to fit whoever signs up.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s not as if other teams harmonize better, it&rsquo;s just Team USA basically building a brand new team every four years vs other squads knowing more or less who&rsquo;s going to be around.</p>

<p>He applauds him for his rotations which he didn’t utilize in the Serbia game at all. There was no hockey substitutions.</p>

<p>He will never criticize anyone because he does not want to lose out on scoops and connections. It&rsquo;s what makes him a good general source but when he gets asked to actually give an opinion, he always favors the teams because that&rsquo;s where his bread is buttered.</p>

      <label for="lhbc35i" class="commentText"><p>first 30 seconds is complete nonsense and it&rsquo;s kind of a bummer to see Windy playing dumb like this. it&rsquo;s obviously not USA vs. World. the most competitive match-up is still an NBA all-star team against like one noteworthy NBA player, one or two NBA role players, and a bunch of randos. if everybody played like they were in the NBA Finals they would/should absolutely annihilate everybody, similar to the NBA team vs. college team hypotheticals. Windy&rsquo;s also praising Kerr&rsquo;s coaching (???) which everybody was rightfully clowning yesterday until the team woke up, ignored Kerr, went full AAU ball, and came back to win a game that should&rsquo;ve been a wire-to-wire ass-whooping. regarding the players who are/aren&rsquo;t getting minutes, there&rsquo;s no logical excuse for playing ~27ppg volume scorers like Booker and Edwards over a well-rounded, quality defender like Tatum (who also scores ~27ppg) when several of the greatest scorers who have ever lived are already on the court</p>

      <label for="lhbkdvw" class="commentText"><p>Totally disagree. Booker is a better point of attack/guard defender these Olympics than Tatum and was needed for his ability to space the floor/move the basketball. Edwards has been playing a lot better than Tatum offensively and defensively these Olympics. Kerr just followed the trends and trusted Edwards more. Obviously, Edwards didn&rsquo;t deliver and Tatum could have taken Edwards minutes, but Kerr was right in playing Edwards over Tatum</p>

      <label for="lhbbj69" class="commentText"><p>Serbia hit almost every single shot in the first half. Curry had 14 pts after 4 minutes and Serbia was still up because they all went Steph Curry themselves.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the only way international teams can beat the US, to hit all their shots. Once Jokic got in foul trouble in the 4th and the shots weren&rsquo;t falling at the same level for Serbia the US caught up.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t see the criticism for Kerr personally, I agree with Windhorst in what he&rsquo;s saying, the US just don&rsquo;t practice together, if another team shoots lights out the US can lose in a 1 game elimination tournament no matter how big of a talent gap there is.</p>

<p>Kerr has been fine.</p>

<p>They started Booker Jrue Curry LeBron Embiid - got Booker, Jrue doing their best to guard Serbia&rsquo;s shooters. Then they have Edwards/White come in for guard defense when Booker and Jrue need rest. They had Embiid matchup against Jokic, then Bam/Davis come in when Embiid needs rest. KD comes in since he&rsquo;s team USA&rsquo;s greatest scorer. Tatum doesn&rsquo;t really take any of their minutes.</p>

They were getting cooked defensively and they couldn&rsquo;t rebound. Hmm I wonder why its truly a mystery.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad Curry and Embiid showed out because if they played anything like they had the rest of the tournament, including the previous games against Serbia, team USA would have been sent home by a vastly inferior team and that would have been on Kerr 100%</p>

      <label for="lhbutok" class="commentText"><p>team Serbia is 100% the best team that team USA faced this Olympics and they will not be sent home by any other team.</p>

<p>Everyone was not having their best game and Kerr stuck with the lineup(Booker, Curry, KD, Lebron, Embiid) that worked in the end so he deserves credit for the adjustment.</p>

<p>The 3 guard lineup makes sense in that they needed players to chase Serbia&rsquo;s shooters around screens. Jrue is a better perimeter and guard defender than Tatum. Booker has also been elite these olympics with his POA defense. Obviously Steph, LeBron, and Embiid starts. </p>

<p>They were getting cooked defensively because Serbia brought their A game and shot the ball well. Tatum wouldn&rsquo;t have changed that because I don&rsquo;t think he would have done a better job than Holiday/White in perimeter defense.</p>

<p>They trusted the Embiid, Lebron, and KD/KD, Bam, and Davis lineups to rebound well. I don&rsquo;t think Tatum would have been a better choice than any of them.</p>

<p>How are they gonna rebound anything if Serbia is hitting every single shot? There were no rebounds to be had. There&rsquo;s just not that much you can do if a team decides to sink everything. Tatum isn&rsquo;t fighting over screens better than Jrue or Booker.</p>
