<p>They paid for this in the 4th quarter, getting into the bonus early and having Joker play with 4 fouls.</p>

<p>This was an amazing game from the Serbians and they were pulling out all the stops to get a win here which they hadn&rsquo;t shown in the exhibition matches and frankly even the group stage.</p>

      <label for="lhbj3uo" class="commentText"><p>Europe was actually ahead on the 3 ball by quite a bit.</p>

<p>In 2001 the average 3 point attempt per game for teams in the NBA was 13.7. In Euroleague <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> teams attempted more per game that year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some older fans says that people used to criticize European ball for chucking too many 3&rsquo;s lol.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Europe has been catching up to America. A lot of these teams from smaller countries can field several quality NBA players now.</p>

<p>Look at Serbia. They have the best player in the world, Bogdanovic who is a quality role player, Jovic who just got playoff minutes, Micic who appeared in 60 games this year and averaged 11 pts and 6 assists in 30 games for Charlotte. And then you have a bunch of guys who were late picks and bounced around the NBA and Euroleague. You weren&rsquo;t getting that 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Now, the overall talent gap is still huge but it&rsquo;s at the point where good teamplay and roster construction can overcome it so in the future USA is gonna need to build smarter rosters. We&rsquo;ve already seen this on the last couple of world cups where USA couldn&rsquo;t win on talent alone along with some scares in the last two Olympics.</p>

      <label for="lhbk5dh" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I don‚Äôt mean to imply that the level of talent around the world hasn‚Äôt risen, it has. And shooting is obviously a talent too. I just think 3 pt variance is a larger component to winning now, and its importance is growing every year. And that‚Äôs the actual reason why these games are going to be scarier for Team USA.</p>

<p>When you just look at overall ‚Äútalent‚Äù, USA is still far ahead of every team. But they have to commit to playing a style that emphasizes creating good looks from 3, and defending the 3, otherwise they‚Äôll lose to anybody.. even South Sudan who scared them in the warm up games by getting hot from 3.</p>

Lebron was directing traffic a couple of times, but besides that, it was a lot of transition and exploiting mismatches which doesn&rsquo;t require a coach calling set plays.</p>

      <label for="lhbchek" class="commentText"><p>Where I struggle with yesterday‚Äôs game is the only adjustment Kerr made was just to put the closing 5 out there as long as possible. It was clear this was a game where Ant, Jrue, and DWhite didnt have it. Even Booker was out there doing cardio for the 4th quarter, while Melo has him clearing out for an ISO from his court side seat. The rigidity in not utilizing two great players in Tatum or Hali that could bring something different in that 2nd unit is just confusing. Playmaking from both, better switching perimeter defense and size from Tatum, maybe you get a flurry of shots from Hali. The idea that there‚Äôs never, ever going to be a chance for them to enter the game just baffles me.</p>

      <label for="lhbffnx" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. Feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills people talking about how great TNT analysis is. They‚Äôre charismatic and that‚Äôs about it. They hate the modern game. Shaq hates every big man not named Giannis and somehow takes a slight anytime any of them are given a compliment. I also cringe every time Shaq unironically says ‚ÄúThe others‚Äù. He‚Äôs so proud of that phrase too. They ALL talk generically about the game and say casual stuff like ‚Äúthey just wanted it more‚Äù or ‚Äúthey need to get that killer instinct‚Äù.  Basically if it‚Äôs not a star going off or a star letting people down they have no idea what to say. They‚Äôre also wayy behind on knowing who are the emerging 4th or 5th guys on a team and it‚Äôs because THEY DONT WATCH THE GAMES. And they brag about it too. Every time Chuck talks about how he can‚Äôt wait for another hockey playoff game cause he can‚Äôt stand the nba playoff game he just watched it‚Äôs like, alright why the fuck are you here then. Bunch of pampered babies. Ernie honestly is the only good one imo and that‚Äôs cause he‚Äôs able to keep the show from going off the rails.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs bad for the sport of basketball that the most popular basketball TV show is one that hates the game of basketball.</p>

<p>And don‚Äôt even get me started on the bus driver nonsense that this sub eats up</p>

      <label for="lhbh3dy" class="commentText"><p>As a Sixers fan it&rsquo;s so frustrating having their games on TNT because I have to hear about how Joel should &ldquo;play like a big man.&rdquo; When:</p>

<p>A: he posts up more than anyone not named Jokic. And:</p>

<p>B: any amount of the type of physicality that Shaq and Chuck are describing leads to flagrants.</p>

<p>They are always telling him to just bully the smaller guys seemingly not seeing that that leads to offensive fouls (mostly from flops), double teams, turnovers, and flagrants. The NBA does not guard big men of Joel&rsquo;s talent the way they did back when they were playing. And the rules certainly do not favor the big man.</p>

      <label for="lhbc35i" class="commentText"><p>first 30 seconds is complete nonsense and it&rsquo;s kind of a bummer to see Windy playing dumb like this. it&rsquo;s obviously not USA vs. World. the most competitive match-up is still an NBA all-star team against like one noteworthy NBA player, one or two NBA role players, and a bunch of randos. if everybody played like they were in the NBA Finals they would/should absolutely annihilate everybody, similar to the NBA team vs. college team hypotheticals. Windy&rsquo;s also praising Kerr&rsquo;s coaching (???) which everybody was rightfully clowning yesterday until the team woke up, ignored Kerr, went full AAU ball, and came back to win a game that should&rsquo;ve been a wire-to-wire ass-whooping. regarding the players who are/aren&rsquo;t getting minutes, there&rsquo;s no logical excuse for playing ~27ppg volume scorers like Booker and Edwards over a well-rounded, quality defender like Tatum (who also scores ~27ppg) when several of the greatest scorers who have ever lived are already on the court</p>

      <label for="lhbkdvw" class="commentText"><p>Totally disagree. Booker is a better point of attack/guard defender these Olympics than Tatum and was needed for his ability to space the floor/move the basketball. Edwards has been playing a lot better than Tatum offensively and defensively these Olympics. Kerr just followed the trends and trusted Edwards more. Obviously, Edwards didn&rsquo;t deliver and Tatum could have taken Edwards minutes, but Kerr was right in playing Edwards over Tatum</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the only way international teams can beat the US, to hit all their shots. Once Jokic got in foul trouble in the 4th and the shots weren&rsquo;t falling at the same level for Serbia the US caught up.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t see the criticism for Kerr personally, I agree with Windhorst in what he&rsquo;s saying, the US just don&rsquo;t practice together, if another team shoots lights out the US can lose in a 1 game elimination tournament no matter how big of a talent gap there is.</p>

<p>Kerr has been fine.</p>

      <label for="lhbkqcy" class="commentText"><p>Jokic always does that its why he&rsquo;s the best player in the world. Didn&rsquo;t stop Team USA from blowing them out the last two games. Maybe make some adjustments its what coaches are for and Serbia made them. Setting screens and pick n pop isn&rsquo;t some brand new tactic</p>

      <label for="lhbmwt7" class="commentText"><p>what adjustments would they have made? they were playing the best lineups they had that matched up to Serbia.</p>

<p>They started Booker Jrue Curry LeBron Embiid - got Booker, Jrue doing their best to guard Serbia&rsquo;s shooters. Then they have Edwards/White come in for guard defense when Booker and Jrue need rest. They had Embiid matchup against Jokic, then Bam/Davis come in when Embiid needs rest. KD comes in since he&rsquo;s team USA&rsquo;s greatest scorer. Tatum doesn&rsquo;t really take any of their minutes.</p>

      <label for="lhbizrg" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s Team USA who shot lights out, not Serbia. Two more threes would have put Serbia at 44% from 3, which is very good but nothing too crazy. Meanwhile Team USA shot 50% from 3. The question people should be asking is why Serbia got 10 more shots off.</p>

      <label for="lhbjx0p" class="commentText"><p>Are you talking about the whole game or up until half time?</p>

<p>Serbia certainly couldn&rsquo;t miss in the first quarter, they were great in the 2nd as well. Not sure where to find stats for 3p% at halftime but I&rsquo;m guessing your stats are not that.</p>

      <label for="lhblx5p" class="commentText"><p>Single elimination games especially in fiba is getting harder and harder to win based on quality. If you don‚Äôt know how to play together, you can be buried in a matter of minutes. Also 3 pointer is the great equaliser. I get what Charles is saying on paper but in reality since the 08 Spain team, fiba has only gotten harder and more technical.</p>

<p>This is literally the take everyone had while watching the game yesterday, and now they want to pretend that they watched an entirely different game üòÇ selective memory at its finest</p>
