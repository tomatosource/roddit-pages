But the flip side of that is when he adjusts well and we win the game you gotta give the coaches a ton of credit</p>

      <label for="lhbj3uo" class="commentText"><p>Europe was actually ahead on the 3 ball by quite a bit.</p>

<p>In 2001 the average 3 point attempt per game for teams in the NBA was 13.7. In Euroleague <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> teams attempted more per game that year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some older fans says that people used to criticize European ball for chucking too many 3&rsquo;s lol.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Europe has been catching up to America. A lot of these teams from smaller countries can field several quality NBA players now.</p>

<p>Look at Serbia. They have the best player in the world, Bogdanovic who is a quality role player, Jovic who just got playoff minutes, Micic who appeared in 60 games this year and averaged 11 pts and 6 assists in 30 games for Charlotte. And then you have a bunch of guys who were late picks and bounced around the NBA and Euroleague. You weren&rsquo;t getting that 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Now, the overall talent gap is still huge but it&rsquo;s at the point where good teamplay and roster construction can overcome it so in the future USA is gonna need to build smarter rosters. We&rsquo;ve already seen this on the last couple of world cups where USA couldn&rsquo;t win on talent alone along with some scares in the last two Olympics.</p>

      <label for="lhbk5dh" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I don’t mean to imply that the level of talent around the world hasn’t risen, it has. And shooting is obviously a talent too. I just think 3 pt variance is a larger component to winning now, and its importance is growing every year. And that’s the actual reason why these games are going to be scarier for Team USA.</p>

<p>When you just look at overall “talent”, USA is still far ahead of every team. But they have to commit to playing a style that emphasizes creating good looks from 3, and defending the 3, otherwise they’ll lose to anybody.. even South Sudan who scared them in the warm up games by getting hot from 3.</p>

Fast-forward 4 years when Durant and Curry are retired, and LeBron is maybe finally slowing down at 44 (j/k, not really… til he’s 90…), we’ll be fielding a team of all-stars, but will we see any other generational talents like these 3?</p>

<p>They paid for this in the 4th quarter, getting into the bonus early and having Joker play with 4 fouls.</p>

<p>This was an amazing game from the Serbians and they were pulling out all the stops to get a win here which they hadn&rsquo;t shown in the exhibition matches and frankly even the group stage.</p>

      <label for="lhbp2zu" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but it wasn&rsquo;t just the shot making, the shots they were taking were easier. It looked like they were left open more in those first 3 quarters, felt like the defense kept either over committing for steals or trying to prevent backdoor cuts inside and then in the 4th they locked down and stayed with their man so the 3s were looking more contested.</p>

      <label for="lhcjmid" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know about that. I think in the end the US wore them out. They had plenty of open looks at the end but they were front rimming it indictive of tire legs. But I agree Serbia put themselves in foul trouble but that was also indicative of them trying to hamper a team that was bigger, stronger, and faster. They were pulling out all the tricks. Fouling a bunch and see what they could get an away with. Flopping a ton. They pulled all the tricks out. The foul trouble combined with having to chase US around all game, like you can see the panic in them when Curry had the ball…that is a tougo task because your fighting through screens and having to switch but the guy your switching off is still really fucking good so your still having to hedge And be physical. By design US seemed to give them semi open looks from deep knowing it is still not a high percentage shot and for the most part they were still some what contested props to serbia for having a scheme that is going to get you open looks. They did put more full court pressure in the 4th making it difficult to get into there sets and making them fight for it which wore on them. It is hard to beat the same team three times in a row…the US did that and they didn’t even play there best.</p>

<p>I mean part of that &ldquo;elite shot making&rdquo; had to do with bad coaching choices too. Collapsing too much on Joker, not taking Ant out for Tatum when it was clear Ant was having a terrible game, bad rotations on defense&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lhbz45v" class="commentText"><p>I think the problem is that you are operating with this theoretical ideal of Tatum based on the aggregate of his production over his career, but simply put he is in a slump, has been a husk of his ideal, and has not been able to find a way to be as impactful as the other guys this Olympics.</p>

<p>If you have a lineup of guys that have been very impactful over the sample size of the Olympics being completely shut down, idk why you would want to go to the one guy who has not been impactful throughout the Olympics in hopes that he is this time?? Especially when you&rsquo;re down 17 in an elimination game??</p>

<p>I completely get that Tatum as we all know him is extremely impactful, but he just hasn&rsquo;t been that guy as of late. Probabilistically, it didn&rsquo;t make sense to go to him last game because one should be more confident guys like Ant, White, Jrue, AD, and Bam would get their shit together before Tatum due to the quality of their recent performances.</p>

      <label for="lhc0opu" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. Additionally, Kerr did adjust. He only played the bench ~10 min and then he rightfully pulled them when they didn&rsquo;t have it going. He gave Ant an extra 3 min (~13 min) and then pulled him. Are people really that upset that Tatum ,who has struggled with his shot over the entire tournament and may not be sufficiently warmed up, didn&rsquo;t get those 3 minutes?</p>

<p>I still believe his length and rebounding would have been more of a net positive yesterday for Team USA over Ant who was visibly out of it and a nonfactor, but I&rsquo;ll admit that is some <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> hindsight in comparison.</p>

      <label for="lhc5tw7" class="commentText"><p>So my question is then when is it so obvious that they HAVE to do it? 40 minutes in a FIBA game and Team USA was down massive at the half because Kerr trusted Ant too much and he never responded.</p>

<p>I get that Tatum has not been shooting well, but given his vastly longer track record in the NBA Playoffs AND his prior service as the #2 scorer for Team USA in Tokyo, why not just pull Ant for Tatum in a tight game where Ant is giving you nothing towards the end of Q2 but Tatum at least gets you length and switchability on the perimeter?</p>

<p>Now, part of that was also the US tightening their defense, but Serbia went cold in the 4th. It’s a testament to how well they played in the other quarters that the US pulled it off by the skin of their teeth!</p>

<p>Spot on. I was saying the whole game USA going to make their move, and if they get within 5 it&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>Why? Once fatigue sets in late, legs get tired and those same 3&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t falling anymore&hellip;&hellip;now the talent disparity will show. Waaaaaaaaay too much talent to overcome&hellip;..nobody is guarding Steph on the perimeter.</p>

      <label for="lhbouu2" class="commentText"><p>Lebron and Steph inspire that kind of play. Steph is constantly moving but it hasn’t been until recently that guys realized they had to stop ball watching and start down screening for Steph as he whirls around the court. Lebron has always been pass-first until he needs to be aggressive.</p>

<p>I’m sure Boston hates the benching, but the reality is Tatum was a frustrating ball watcher and almost never cut or set screens. It was an offense killer. Who are you gonna sub him in for? KD? Bron? Or play him at guard? He wasn’t going to fill that role better than White, Jrue or Book.</p>

<p>Durant and KD love playing with Steph, and Embiid was as motivated as I’ve ever seen him last night. That screen he set for Steph was bone crushing and it was the first time I saw him actively seek out his screen, and timed it perfectly.</p>

<p>Booker is the perfect guy to use as a defensive specialist / play finisher - he just coached Klay Thompson for a decade.</p>

      <label for="lhc6sf9" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, IDK about this take.</p>

<p>I might not have <em>some</em> insights that any former player would have. However, if a former player declines to educate themselves on some very basic stats or watch the games, are we supposed to just take their words as gospel? If so, what are the limits?</p>

<p>Could a guy who had a 10-day contract in 2014 and has never watched an NBA game in 10 years still have better takes than someone who does player analysis backed up with a ton of stats and has watched 10 games a week for the last 10 years?</p>

<p>Obviously Chuck is a legend and will watch the occasional game, but mostly he&rsquo;s an entertainer who watches highlights and takes naps when the game is on.</p>

      <label for="lhc8f80" class="commentText"><p>I agree. Inside the NBA is entertainment. They hardly do any analysis. The fact that <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the people on the show are former players doesn’t somehow make that any less true. Being a former player doesn’t mean you’re gonna be able to be an analyst of the game. Especially when they don’t even watch most of the games.</p>

      <label for="lhcaror" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a balance. I think basically any NBA player that had a few years in the league could leave the bench for a studio, but the bare minimum requirement next to that resume is that they watch the games and when told stats contradict their assumptions, they don&rsquo;t dig in and refuse to believe them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s shocking how many former players become &ldquo;analysts&rdquo; but really all they do is talk shit and watch highlights.</p>

      <label for="lhbffnx" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. Feel like I’m taking crazy pills people talking about how great TNT analysis is. They’re charismatic and that’s about it. They hate the modern game. Shaq hates every big man not named Giannis and somehow takes a slight anytime any of them are given a compliment. I also cringe every time Shaq unironically says “The others”. He’s so proud of that phrase too. They ALL talk generically about the game and say casual stuff like “they just wanted it more” or “they need to get that killer instinct”.  Basically if it’s not a star going off or a star letting people down they have no idea what to say. They’re also wayy behind on knowing who are the emerging 4th or 5th guys on a team and it’s because THEY DONT WATCH THE GAMES. And they brag about it too. Every time Chuck talks about how he can’t wait for another hockey playoff game cause he can’t stand the nba playoff game he just watched it’s like, alright why the fuck are you here then. Bunch of pampered babies. Ernie honestly is the only good one imo and that’s cause he’s able to keep the show from going off the rails.</p>

<p>It’s bad for the sport of basketball that the most popular basketball TV show is one that hates the game of basketball.</p>

<p>And don’t even get me started on the bus driver nonsense that this sub eats up</p>

<p>A: he posts up more than anyone not named Jokic. And:</p>

<p>B: any amount of the type of physicality that Shaq and Chuck are describing leads to flagrants.</p>

<p>They are always telling him to just bully the smaller guys seemingly not seeing that that leads to offensive fouls (mostly from flops), double teams, turnovers, and flagrants. The NBA does not guard big men of Joel&rsquo;s talent the way they did back when they were playing. And the rules certainly do not favor the big man.</p>

<p>Southgate has never won anything. He’s heralded basically for vibes alone but each and every team we needed a coaching masterclass against on the biggest stage, he shit the bed. It’s criminal that we couldn’t win against Italy, at home, with a lead. He turned some of the most exciting talents in world football into mundane, ineffectual players.</p>

<p>Kerr is an out and out winner. He was a winner as a player, he’s won as a head coach in the NBA and he’s more than likely about to be an Olympic champion head coach. The basketball he plays is fun to watch and it utilizes (mostly) his best players in their most influential spots on the floor.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The &ldquo;playing together for years&rdquo; is overblown. The best players on other teams - Jokic for Serbia, randos for Australia, SGA for Canada, Gianns for Greece, etc - all play most of their games in the NBA and play for the national team once a year at most.</p>

<p>The national coaching staff for other countries is more consistent and also follow a very specific gameplan of building around a particular style or playbooks, whereas the US Dream Team is basically ad-hoc every four years and has to be rebuilt to fit whoever signs up.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s not as if other teams harmonize better, it&rsquo;s just Team USA basically building a brand new team every four years vs other squads knowing more or less who&rsquo;s going to be around.</p>

<p>Ask yourself how does a German team with two bench players in Thesis, Schroder and a rising star in Franz beat the USA in the World Cup? That US team isn&rsquo;t the one we have now but still on paper are much more talented.</p>

<p>If you watch the semi against Serbia, the turnovers, allowing Serbia to get offensive rebounds, miscommunication on switches + the hot shooting by Serbia killed the US.</p>

      <label for="lhc9j8g" class="commentText"><p>What is “as great as people said they were?” No American team is ever gonna be as good relative to the rest of the world as the dream team was. It’s just not possible with how good the world is now. This current team still absolutely has an argument for being a greater collection of overall talent tho, certainly more than a “hell no”</p>

<p>Especially when u take into account this team’s top 15 all time guys are much better than the DT’s overall, factoring in Magic and Larry’s declines. Plus this team doesn’t have a college player on it who had a worse career than every player on this team is likely to have except maybe DWhite.</p>

      <label for="lhcva43" class="commentText"><p>Based off of? Even tho by 2008, the rest of the world certainly had improved a lot since 92, it’s still a very wide gap between then and now. And even they had a very close game in the final against the second best team, which Serbia is very much in the conversation for being (best player ITW and very possibly the best depth after US and Canada, while not being as unbalanced as Canada or France).</p>

<p>Not to mention how differently the game is played now allows for greater possibilities of upsets, which is literally why Serbia was winning (they couldn’t miss from 3 and shot a ton), which also, along with just every team being so much better nowadays in general, is why we had a few close games in exhibition. The 3 not being utilized to that degree back in 2008 meant basically zero chance for upsetting a team with clearly superior talent.</p>

<p>So again, as i said already, there’s literally never going to be another team better relative to the rest of the world as the dream team, and quite possibly the 2008 team as well. But that has less to do with those teams being so much better, and much more to do w the fact that world is catching up relatively while we have a cap because we’ve always been the peak of basketball.  Saying 2024 “isn’t particularly close” to 2008 is honestly crazy, it’s one thing to say you think one is better than the other, but any year where we intentionally get our best possible roster together and have multiple top 20 OAT players still playing at a top 10 ITW level leading the charge is not going to be <em>not particularly close</em> to any other team in history outside of 2K all-time lineups.</p>

<p>TL;DR: you’re ignoring that 2008 had a close game too, underrating the impact of how good the rest of the world has gotten and the impact of volume 3 point shooting, and Bc of these factors, using terms like “obviously” and “not close” are rooted solely in <em>your</em> opinion despite you presenting them as though they are objective facts (almost nothing in sports is, but we have general consensus, which yours will only be to ppl who either hate modern day basketball or think the rest of the world is only marginally better than it was in 2008, when it’s likely closer to more than double)</p>

      <label for="lhc69vs" class="commentText"><p>The world isn’t tremendous. By some accounts we put three of the top 15 players of all time out on that court.</p>

<p>It’s just dumb. Every four years we pretend that beating up on a team with an NBA starter, 1-2 NBA bench guys and a few Euros is some great accomplishment. It’s not.</p>

<p>Like, we have people asking if this is maybe the greatest basketball team of all time. They shouldn’t need to claw back against Serbia, and then crow and beat their chests.</p>

<p>He applauds him for his rotations which he didn’t utilize in the Serbia game at all. There was no hockey substitutions.</p>

      <label for="lhbc35i" class="commentText"><p>first 30 seconds is complete nonsense and it&rsquo;s kind of a bummer to see Windy playing dumb like this. it&rsquo;s obviously not USA vs. World. the most competitive match-up is still an NBA all-star team against like one noteworthy NBA player, one or two NBA role players, and a bunch of randos. if everybody played like they were in the NBA Finals they would/should absolutely annihilate everybody, similar to the NBA team vs. college team hypotheticals. Windy&rsquo;s also praising Kerr&rsquo;s coaching (???) which everybody was rightfully clowning yesterday until the team woke up, ignored Kerr, went full AAU ball, and came back to win a game that should&rsquo;ve been a wire-to-wire ass-whooping. regarding the players who are/aren&rsquo;t getting minutes, there&rsquo;s no logical excuse for playing ~27ppg volume scorers like Booker and Edwards over a well-rounded, quality defender like Tatum (who also scores ~27ppg) when several of the greatest scorers who have ever lived are already on the court</p>

      <label for="lhbkdvw" class="commentText"><p>Totally disagree. Booker is a better point of attack/guard defender these Olympics than Tatum and was needed for his ability to space the floor/move the basketball. Edwards has been playing a lot better than Tatum offensively and defensively these Olympics. Kerr just followed the trends and trusted Edwards more. Obviously, Edwards didn&rsquo;t deliver and Tatum could have taken Edwards minutes, but Kerr was right in playing Edwards over Tatum</p>
