      <label for="lhb9cmf" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s fine to criticize Kerr and the coaching when we’re down by 20 at half or whatever, Olympics is hyper results focused since it&rsquo;s a max of 6 40 minute games. But the flip side of that is when he adjusts well and we win the game you gotta give the coaches a ton of credit</p>

<p>Regardless the point is I’m stoked it worked out, one more fellas get that 🥇 </p>

<p>i dont think that makes kerr look bad or anything. you’re usually not gonna have as many set plays in FIBA, less time to practice. and they still ran actions, it wasnt just iso ball.</p>

LeBron, KD, Steph are obvious closers sure, but I think sticking with Embiid and Book next to them put them in a great position to succeed and clearly paid off</p>

      <label for="lhbesy4" class="commentText"><p>The way KD described it, it sounded like everyone on the floor was high BBIQ and knew exactly how to play off of Lebron and Embiid so they didn&rsquo;t have to communicate much on offense. Lebron was directing traffic a couple of times, but besides that, it was a lot of transition and exploiting mismatches which doesn&rsquo;t require a coach calling set plays.</p>

      <label for="lhbchek" class="commentText"><p>Where I struggle with yesterday’s game is the only adjustment Kerr made was just to put the closing 5 out there as long as possible. It was clear this was a game where Ant, Jrue, and DWhite didnt have it. Even Booker was out there doing cardio for the 4th quarter, while Melo has him clearing out for an ISO from his court side seat. The rigidity in not utilizing two great players in Tatum or Hali that could bring something different in that 2nd unit is just confusing. Playmaking from both, better switching perimeter defense and size from Tatum, maybe you get a flurry of shots from Hali. The idea that there’s never, ever going to be a chance for them to enter the game just baffles me.</p>

      <label for="lhbffnx" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. Feel like I’m taking crazy pills people talking about how great TNT analysis is. They’re charismatic and that’s about it. They hate the modern game. Shaq hates every big man not named Giannis and somehow takes a slight anytime any of them are given a compliment. They ALL talk generically about the game and say casual stuff like “they just wanted it more” or “they need to get that killer instinct”. Ernie honestly is the only good one imo and that’s cause he’s able to keep the show from going off the rails.</p>

<p>It’s bad for the sport of basketball that the most popular basketball TV show is one that hates the game of basketball.</p>

      <label for="lhbc35i" class="commentText"><p>first 30 seconds is complete nonsense and it&rsquo;s kind of a bummer to see Windy playing dumb like this. it&rsquo;s obviously not USA vs. World. the most competitive match-up is still an NBA all-star team against like one noteworthy NBA player, one or two NBA role players, and a bunch of randos. if everybody played like they were in the NBA Finals they would/should absolutely annihilate everybody, similar to the NBA team vs. college team hypotheticals. Windy&rsquo;s also praising Kerr&rsquo;s coaching (???) which everybody was rightfully clowning yesterday until the team woke up, ignored Kerr, went full AAU ball, and came back to win a game that should&rsquo;ve been a wire-to-wire ass-whooping. regarding the players who are/aren&rsquo;t getting minutes, there&rsquo;s no logical excuse for playing ~27ppg volume scorers like Booker and Edwards over a well-rounded, quality defender like Tatum (who also scores ~27ppg) when several of the greatest scorers who have ever lived are already on the court</p>

      <label for="lhbbj69" class="commentText"><p>Serbia hit almost every single shot in the first half. Curry had 14 pts after 4 minutes and Serbia was still up because they all went Steph Curry themselves.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the only way international teams can beat the US, to hit all their shots. Once Jokic got in foul trouble in the 4th and the shots weren&rsquo;t falling at the same level for Serbia the US caught up.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t see the criticism for Kerr personally, I agree with Windhorst in what he&rsquo;s saying, the US just don&rsquo;t practice together, if another team shoots lights out the US can lose in a 1 game elimination tournament no matter how big of a talent gap there is.</p>

<p>Kerr has been fine.</p>
