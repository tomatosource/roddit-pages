      <label for="la4aitu" class="commentText"><p>A huge basketball mistake. If you’re a cheap owner, you already have a ring, easily the best player in the world, and a roster that will be towards the top but never gonna be able to just cruise through the west like in 23 anytime soon. Their depth is already terrible, if Jokic isn’t on the court they’re honestly not that good, and they have no real way to improve the roster. KCP or no they’re probably a top seed that has to fight hard past round one next year. If you don’t think the chances of them winning are that high you might care about your own money more.</p>

<p>I mean it’s not like they’re ever not going to be good and packing the arena while prime Jokic is there. But the rest of the team honestly isn’t that great, kcp or no they’re probably in a dogfight that could go either way by the second round next year.</p>

<p>So many west teams got better or are going to get better. Given their roster situation they can really only stay the same or get worse.</p>

      <label for="la3rsk5" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this. If we want to talk about wasting Jokic&rsquo;s prime not going in to the second apron to keep KCP this year is gonna be exhibit A if that goes down.</p>

<p>I have no sources but I personally feel like this hand wringing over KCP is over blown. It seems like going in to the second apron and keeping our bench while counting on CB and PWat to elevate it is the exact plan Calvin Booth has been talking about for over a year now: Bet on player development.</p>

<p>If a team wants to pay KCP over 30m a year I guess we can reaccess, but anything between 20m-30m should be a no-brainer because that&rsquo;s basically his market rate and won&rsquo;t shouldn&rsquo;t screw us too bad in the future.</p>

Which is IMO a good reason to run it back one more time this year. KCP was not the problem so we need to try sign him and then figure out the bigger changes next year probably trading some combo of AG, MPJ, or KCP with a focus on getting under the apron to avoid long term penalties.</p>

<p>The only way we should let him walk is if someone is willing to pay an egregious amount of money for him, if someone wants to pay an aging (admittedly really good) role player something close to the max that&rsquo;s kind of on them at that point. As long as his contract is in line with his actual market value we should definitely sign him IMO.</p>

      <label for="la465bx" class="commentText"><p>I’m sure the ownership wants the tax bill as low as possible but the second apron restrictions will severely limit their ability to make moves that allow them to fill out that bench or potentially replace a starter.</p>

<p>Given that’s probably going to be an issue either way the best option is to pay to keep KCP, invest in scouting and development to find ways to fortify the bench for cheap (starting 5 is good enough either way) and if problems come up in the future you can figure it out then.</p>

<p>If MPJ had real trade value I&rsquo;d say you could flip him for a couple of role players, but I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is touching that contract.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think their limited offer had to do with the 2nd apron, I think it had to do with Denver not having his bird rights. He got a $22.5m offer from Indy so it was a no brainer for him to leave.</p>

If they pull off a deal for PG and resign Maxey, there is no way they would spend $20-25mil on KCP with so many roster spots to fill and not much space before hitting the 2nd apron.</p>

Still a very good defender, but does have particular matchups that he really struggles with like Ant. Ultimately I don&rsquo;t think they bring him back and instead prioritize extensions for Jamal and AG (next offseason), along with moderate improvements to the bench.</p>

      <label for="la39c32" class="commentText"><p>Nuggets keep losing more and more important pieces that got them their championship in the first place.</p>

<p>Yes Jokic and Murray are the main pieces but losing Brown didn’t do them any favors (even with Christian stepping up) and losing KCP certainly won’t help their case either and understandably he’s looking for his payday, he’s been taking pay cuts for years now since his Detroit days, time to get paid before he finishes his rounds with this league.</p>

<p>They gotta spend some money to stay in the race while Jokic is healthy and in his prime as he has been. Cause you can’t count on Murray or MPJ in terms of health that’s too big of a dice roll.</p>

<p>Luckily you got Gordon locked in long term to a very team friendly deal as long as his production stays what it has been.</p>

Inconsistent 3-ball, but still a versatile scorer, superb defender, and just a glue guy any winning team will welcome. Even if no other teams really want to pay him, Nuggets can&rsquo;t really afford to lose him, so he can use that leverage to get a raise in a longer deal.</p>

<ul>
<li>we are getting some of the more punitive 2nd apron punishments going into effect</li>
<li>this is the last summer in a while where the cap will not spike by 10% (new TV deal)</li>

<p>I think the veterans that are looking for max extensions this summer (Butler, George) wouldn’t have gotten much pushback on a max if the 2nd apron wasn’t in effect.</p>

      <label for="la46prz" class="commentText"><p>To your point about crazy situations and outcomes, I think we&rsquo;ll definitely see some trades in the near future that seem puzzling on the surface, but make sense when you factor in how teams not really in contention will do anything to avoid the second apron, especially for multiple years. The roster management implications are massive, specifically as it relates to trades, exceptions, and buyout players, and teams like the Suns or Bucks might have to make some lopsided deals if their teams don&rsquo;t pan out to start next year.</p>

It does push them into the 2nd apron, but there&rsquo;s no rule preventing them from running it back.  Their major issue is that they&rsquo;re paying MPJ 6-10m a year than they should be, and gave Ninaj a bigger contract than they should&rsquo;ve.</p>

The Nuggets were an example of developing their top talent and even signing AG they utilized him in a way no other team had. I wouldn&rsquo;t say they were a &ldquo;mercenary&rdquo; type team.</p>

<p>To me it seems like most teams windows will just be very small and there will be a lot more luck-based results, Which can be fine for entertainment purposes. But I doubt a team like the Celtics this year is constructed again.</p>

<p>At some point just like we lowered the bar from Russell&rsquo;s 11 to say &ldquo;yeah but you don&rsquo;t ACTUALLY have to match that to be in the GOAT convo, it was so much easier to win back then&rdquo; we might have to do the same for MJ&rsquo;s 6 in the context of that it will be almost impossible for a player to win 6 on <em>one team</em> now</p>

<p>Not true. Denver could only pay him around <del>11M</del> 7.8M a year, which was less than half than what he got.</p>

<p>When the Nuggets have had a competitive team, they have very willingly gone into the tax. Don&rsquo;t be lying to people man lol</p>

Which basically means Boston is committed to being a second apron team for only a couple years.</p>

<p>Jaylens extension kicks in starting this year. Jaysons and Derricks extensions would start in the 25-26 season when the cap starts going up 10%, but they would be signed based on the current cap number. If they both sign this off season which seems likely.</p>

<p>Basically Celtics ownership is committed to paying the tax for a few years to keep this core together understanding that it’ll get lighter in a few years, and the Celtics are only behind the warriors in terms of cap luck.</p>

They can sell off everyone but the Jays and still be a competitive team and B, the 2nd apron can cripple a franchise. No salary matching, no MLEs, draft picks frozen, no trade exceptions or cash moves. The 2nd apron basically makes it so you have to be the favorites to win a title or you’re screwed long term. Not just screwed long term “oh, we handed out some bad contracts” but screwed where you’re bad AND your draft pick is frozen to the end of the first round….so no tanking….</p>

<p>Jokic deserves any amount of money he can get obviously and is one of the greatest players of all time, so he covers up for a lot of what I’m about to say and since they won a ring they don’t need to feel regret about anything.</p>

<p>But I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Yes, Jamal Murray has had amazing playoff moments but he’s the most overrated player in the NBA and is not really a max level player at all. The reality is the guy has never made an all star team and it’s never been a snub. He’s taking up a massive amount of cap for a sub all star level player who had some pretty bad performances in these playoffs that are more in line with his overall career performance than the playoff Murray moments he’s had in some recent post seasons.</p>

<p>MPJ is a really unique player and has value but he’s just no where near impactful enough to be getting a max. I get why they did it, but they’re feeling the hurt of it now.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the nuggets situation is what happens when <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of your max salaries are not really anywhere near max level talents. They won a chip last year of Jokic’s brilliance, but the talent around him isn’t really good enough. It just works because Jokic is so amazing that they all get great looks and he structures an offense perfectly.</p>

      <label for="la4fjxk" class="commentText"><p>I agree with that outlook as of now, but it must be said that Murray played at a clear All-NBA level during the entirety of the 2023 playoffs. It wasn&rsquo;t just a hot series, his production during the entire run was arguably better than anyone on the Celtics this season.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right about him in the regular season, but that chip wasn&rsquo;t just Jokic, it was Jokic, then Murray, then a sizeable gap with 4 very useful contributors - and that taps into a bigger issue which is MPJ&rsquo;s contract, despite him fitting quite well</p>

<p>Jokic contract is such good value it covers up for the other bad contracts. However, the Nuggets are really testing the limits.</p>

<p>Same with the Knicks, everybody makes under 30mil a year on that team, including Randle and Brunson, and yet we have no cap space in a league that has teams with multiple players making 30, 40, 50+ mil a year</p>

      <label for="la425y9" class="commentText"><p>I don’t disagree about the main point, but I feel like the Warriors were a perfect storm to blow up on value. They were quite undervalued for a team in one of the biggest and richest markets and didn’t have much of a history to have a wide fanbase. Combine that with a new arena coming, the most loved and marketable star in decades (excluding LeBron), and a long dynasty and there you go.</p>

<p>The Celtics are already a top tier brand and their valuation is more reflective of reality. Also, Boston is wealthy, but small.</p>

<p>Celtics will pay up to keep winning though, and I can see the Nuggets cheating out.</p>

      <label for="la35kq5" class="commentText"><p>Celtics only have one guy on a max, although Tatum will make it two soon. Either way, they&rsquo;re just paying a lot to their 5 main guys and are willing and able to take the tax and apron implications due to how young and talented their main guys are along with having their picks still. The CBA will still hit them in some regard at some point but they&rsquo;re in quite possibly the best possible position you can be in while being a second apron team. Put simply, they don&rsquo;t need to make big trades to get better or fill out a bench, and the floor for what they need from the bench is much lower than is typical.</p>

<p>A lot of these other teams are not in that position. Nuggets desperately need a competent bench for when Jokic sits. Paying KCP hurts their ability to do that.</p>

      <label for="la4227f" class="commentText"><p>Watson did not develop as much as we hoped (as shown by his lack of playoff minutes) along with stuff like Strawther getting injured after showing early promise (to the point he did not get playing time after he came back because it was too late in the season).</p>

<p>Nuggets hopes right now are around what happens with KCP, Strawther and Watson improving, and whatever happens with our draft pick. Tough spot to be. With Jokic a lot is still possible but he needs help.</p>

<p>Being selfishly honest I wish him and Murray would skip the olympics and get healthier but I can&rsquo;t be angry at them wanting to represent their countries.</p>

      <label for="la4wm0v" class="commentText"><p>Brown they lost because they didn’t have his bird rights, so unrelated to the aprons. KCP you could argue is related to the apron, but there’s nothing actually preventing the nuggets from re-signing him to be clear. It’s a choice that ownership would make, likely driven more by the tax piece of things using the apron as cover (it seems to me).</p>

<p>The apron makes it really difficult to build/rebuild a team with high salaries, but it doesn’t stop you from retaining an existing core.</p>

      <label for="la3kmqj" class="commentText"><p>Nuggs fans have been going over this nonstop over the last few weeks.  Ownership and FO mentioned being open to going into the 2nd apron during the end of season press conference, but I wonder if at the time this comment was made the focus was solely on consequences for next season without any consideration for how long they would be above the 2nd apron.  The issue is that Murray is eligible for a contract this offseason and Aaron Gordon next offseason.  I wonder if they have started to map out the cap over the next few years and come to the realization that they cannot keep all 4 of Murray, KCP, MPJ, and AG without being above the 2nd apron for several years in a row and just how incredibly debilitating that will be.  Even keeping 3 will be difficult to stay below 2nd apron on a yearly basis, but they would at least have a chance.  I love KCP and they don&rsquo;t win the first ever chip without him, but his skill set is the easiest to replace with what they already have on the roster (Braun is an excellent defender and Strawther can maybe replace some of the shooting).</p>
