<p>They win that series if he plays even remotely the way he&rsquo;s capable of. Easily the worst playoff run of his career.</p>

      <label for="la3oh12" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this isn’t like the way the Mavericks or Wolves just got outmatched, we lost a legitimate toss up series. If MPJ, KCP, or Murray has a decent second half of game 7, the Nuggets clear. I think gambling on that lineup is far wiser than making some sort of drastic change because you were barely beat in a game 7.</p>

<p>Hopefully Murray will remember he makes over $30m a year and won&rsquo;t come into the season out of shape again. Some injuries are freak accidents, but he can def control his own fitness level</p>

Upsets happen, and at the end of the day, Jokic is still the best player in the West right now. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they will win the West, but I don&rsquo;t think there is a safer pick than Denver.</p>

<p>Even more than his shooting, its his decision making and lack of expirience that make him bad on offense at times, which resulted in him getting his minutes cut in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Which is why i just want him to get more in the regular season.</p>

<p>Super athletic too and excelent on a fastbreak.</p>

<p>Sadly its his 3 point shooting thats hit or miss. We need to get him to develope as a shooter and increase his volume.</p>

<p>No doubt Watson has a higher ceiling,but both him and Strawther still arent ready to start.</p>

<p>Watson in particular would be far better as a forward cause he is an amazing shot blocker.</p>

      <label for="la3p7nu" class="commentText"><p>Braun&rsquo;s shooting improved significantly during the 2nd half of the season. Won&rsquo;t ever be as good as KCP, but does provide some spacing.  Excellent cutter when on the floor with Jokic. I would say he is already a better finisher around the rim than KCP.  Better defensive option than KCP with certain defensive matchups like Ant.  He is a downgrade compared to KCP, but is still a good player that will fit well with the rest of the starting group.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think their limited offer had to do with the 2nd apron, I think it had to do with Denver not having his bird rights. He got a $22.5m offer from Indy so it was a no brainer for him to leave.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not going anywhere as long as Jokic is around, but they&rsquo;re also not winning another ring without a strong supporting cast.</p>

<p>If MPJ had real trade value I&rsquo;d say you could flip him for a couple of role players, but I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is touching that contract.</p>

<p>His defense is what makes him good so he its reasonable for him to want a bih contract now while he can still get it.</p>

      <label for="la3py4d" class="commentText"><p>Yeah he wasn&rsquo;t a bad shooter this year, but was inconsistent.  In the playoffs he was pretty bad offensively.  Still a very good defender, but does have particular matchups that he really struggles with like Ant. Ultimately I don&rsquo;t think they bring him back and instead prioritize extensions for Jamal and AG (next offseason), along with moderate improvements to the bench.</p>

      <label for="la39c32" class="commentText"><p>Nuggets keep losing more and more important pieces that got them their championship in the first place.</p>

<p>Yes Jokic and Murray are the main pieces but losing Brown didn’t do them any favors (even with Christian stepping up) and losing KCP certainly won’t help their case either and understandably he’s looking for his payday, he’s been taking pay cuts for years now since his Detroit days, time to get paid before he finishes his rounds with this league.</p>

<p>They gotta spend some money to stay in the race while Jokic is healthy and in his prime as he has been. Cause you can’t count on Murray or MPJ in terms of health that’s too big of a dice roll.</p>

<p>Luckily you got Gordon locked in long term to a very team friendly deal as long as his production stays what it has been.</p>

It does push them into the 2nd apron, but there&rsquo;s no rule preventing them from running it back.  Their major issue is that they&rsquo;re paying MPJ 6-10m a year than they should be, and gave Ninaj a bigger contract than they should&rsquo;ve.</p>

The Nuggets were an example of developing their top talent and even signing AG they utilized him in a way no other team had. I wouldn&rsquo;t say they were a &ldquo;mercenary&rdquo; type team.</p>

<p>To me it seems like most teams windows will just be very small and there will be a lot more luck-based results, Which can be fine for entertainment purposes. But I doubt a team like the Celtics this year is constructed again.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever see a superstar with 5+ rings again with the new rules unless they blatantly ring chase from team to team their entire career</p>

<p>At some point just like we lowered the bar from Russell&rsquo;s 11 to say &ldquo;yeah but you don&rsquo;t ACTUALLY have to match that to be in the GOAT convo, it was so much easier to win back then&rdquo; we might have to do the same for MJ&rsquo;s 6 in the context of that it will be almost impossible for a player to win 6 on <em>one team</em> now</p>

<ul>

<p>I think the veterans that are looking for max extensions this summer (Butler, George) wouldn’t have gotten much pushback on a max if the 2nd apron wasn’t in effect.</p>

<li><p>Timing: Boston just won the title, and most of their core is under 30</p></li>

<li><p>Ownership: The Kroenkes historically haven’t treated the Nuggets as a tax team, as Denver is still considered a smaller market team.</p></li>

<li><p>Management: Tim Connelly, the architect of Denver’s championship team, left for Minnesota shortly before their title season. Calvin Booth, since taking over the Nuggets, acquired Bruce Brown, but also let him walk in free agency in favor of having younger, unproven players on the roster take on a bigger role.</p></li>

<p>Not true. Denver could only pay him around 11M a year, which was less than half than what he got.</p>

<p>If they let KCP go that&rsquo;s a choice, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case for Bruce</p>

<p>You should be aware that most actually want there to be another dynasty. People who say they like parity are kinda just lying to themselves tbh and the dynasty talk is gonna come with prety much every new champion going forward, as it has with the Celtics.</p>

He improves their size in the starting lineup, offers better rebounding and 3PT shooting than they have at that position, and his contract is expiring + not fully guaranteed in the year that Chet and Jalen get expensive.</p>

NBA cap doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me sometimes</p>

<p>Same with the Knicks, everybody makes under 30mil a year on that team, including Randle and Brunson, and yet we have no cap space in a league that has teams with multiple players making 30, 40, 50+ mil a year</p>

<p>Their main stars are also young enoigh for them to not care as much about the hit theyd take if they were in the 2nd apron and their owners are willing to spend as much as needed to keep the team as it is rn.</p>

<p>The big issue with them is that MPJ makes about 6-10m a year than he should and they gave Zeke Ninaj a really dumb contract that overpays him.</p>

      <label for="la35kq5" class="commentText"><p>Celtics only have one guy on a max, although Tatum will make it two soon. Either way, they&rsquo;re just paying a lot to their 5 main guys and are willing and able to take the tax and apron implications due to how young and talented their main guys are along with having their picks still. The CBA will still hit them in some regard at some point but they&rsquo;re in quite possibly the best possible position you can be in while being a second apron team. Put simply, they don&rsquo;t need to make big trades to get better or fill out a bench, and the floor for what they need from the bench is much lower than is typical.</p>

<p>A lot of these other teams are not in that position. Nuggets desperately need a competent bench for when Jokic sits. Paying KCP hurts their ability to do that.</p>

      <label for="la3kmqj" class="commentText"><p>Nuggs fans have been going over this nonstop over the last few weeks.  Ownership and FO mentioned being open to going into the 2nd apron during the end of season press conference, but I wonder if at the time this comment was made the focus was solely on consequences for next season without any consideration for how long they would be above the 2nd apron.  The issue is that Murray is eligible for a contract this offseason and Aaron Gordon next offseason.  I wonder if they have started to map out the cap over the next few years and come to the realization that they cannot keep all 4 of Murray, KCP, MPJ, and AG without being above the 2nd apron for several years in a row and just how incredibly debilitating that will be.  Even keeping 3 will be difficult to stay below 2nd apron on a yearly basis, but they would at least have a chance.  I love KCP and they don&rsquo;t win the first ever chip without him, but his skill set is the easiest to replace with what they already have on the roster (Braun is an excellent defender and Strawther can maybe replace some of the shooting).</p>

<p>I am not attacking Embiid even though it&rsquo;s easy to do because he&rsquo;s actually a great player who&rsquo;s had a rough run of luck.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay to not like Jokic, it&rsquo;s just sad you had to frame your comment in a way to incite further hate and generate reactions.</p>

      <label for="la374o9" class="commentText"><p>Weren’t the Clippers and Jazz both on a 50 win pace in 2020 before the season got shut down? Clippers ended with 49 wins in a 72 game season, if I recall correctly. Basically all games related stats from the Covid shortened seasons need to be adjusted if you’re going to attempt to seriously discuss them (which you’re not of course, but it’s still worth pointing out for everybody else).</p>

If you would prefer losing in the first or second round like the sixers then that&rsquo;s your preference. And that nuggets championship wasn&rsquo;t as weak as playing a bunch of injured teams.</p>
