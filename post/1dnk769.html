The moves available even in 1st apron suck and if the starting lineup doesn&rsquo;t blow out its minutes the bench isn&rsquo;t gonna win so you need to get those 5 positions filled with the best possible guys.</p>

If MPJ, KCP, or Murray has a decent second half of game 7, the Nuggets clear.

Upsets happen, and at the end of the day, Jokic is still the best player in the West right now. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they will win the West, but I don&rsquo;t think there is a safer pick than Denver.</p>

<p>I have no sources but I personally feel like this hand wringing over KCP is over blown. It seems like going in to the second apron and keeping our bench while counting on CB and PWat to elevate it is the exact plan Calvin Booth has been talking about for over a year now: Bet on player development.</p>

<p>If a team wants to pay KCP over 30m a year I guess we can reaccess, but anything between 20m-30m should be a no-brainer because that&rsquo;s basically his market rate and won&rsquo;t shouldn&rsquo;t screw us too bad in the future.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think their limited offer had to do with the 2nd apron, I think it had to do with Denver not having his bird rights. He got a $22.5m offer from Indy so it was a no brainer for him to leave.</p>

<p>Super athletic too and excelent on a fastbreak.</p>

<p>Sadly its his 3 point shooting thats hit or miss. We need to get him to develope as a shooter and increase his volume.</p>

<p>No doubt Watson has a higher ceiling,but both him and Strawther still arent ready to start.</p>

<p>Watson in particular would be far better as a forward cause he is an amazing shot blocker.</p>

      <label for="la3p7nu" class="commentText"><p>Braun&rsquo;s shooting improved significantly during the 2nd half of the season. Won&rsquo;t ever be as good as KCP, but does provide some spacing.  Excellent cutter when on the floor with Jokic. I would say he is already a better finisher around the rim than KCP.  Better defensive option than KCP with certain defensive matchups like Ant.  He is a downgrade compared to KCP, but is still a good player that will fit well with the rest of the starting group.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not going anywhere as long as Jokic is around, but they&rsquo;re also not winning another ring without a strong supporting cast.</p>

<p>If MPJ had real trade value I&rsquo;d say you could flip him for a couple of role players, but I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is touching that contract.</p>

Still a very good defender, but does have particular matchups that he really struggles with like Ant. Ultimately I don&rsquo;t think they bring him back and instead prioritize extensions for Jamal and AG (next offseason), along with moderate improvements to the bench.</p>

      <label for="la39c32" class="commentText"><p>Nuggets keep losing more and more important pieces that got them their championship in the first place.</p>

<p>Yes Jokic and Murray are the main pieces but losing Brown didn’t do them any favors (even with Christian stepping up) and losing KCP certainly won’t help their case either and understandably he’s looking for his payday, he’s been taking pay cuts for years now since his Detroit days, time to get paid before he finishes his rounds with this league.</p>

<p>They gotta spend some money to stay in the race while Jokic is healthy and in his prime as he has been. Cause you can’t count on Murray or MPJ in terms of health that’s too big of a dice roll.</p>

<p>Luckily you got Gordon locked in long term to a very team friendly deal as long as his production stays what it has been.</p>

Inconsistent 3-ball, but still a versatile scorer, superb defender, and just a glue guy any winning team will welcome. Even if no other teams really want to pay him, Nuggets can&rsquo;t really afford to lose him, so he can use that leverage to get a raise in a longer deal.</p>

      <label for="la34005" class="commentText"><p>How much do you think a team is going to be able to develop? The Nuggets were an example of developing their top talent and even signing AG they utilized him in a way no other team had. I wouldn&rsquo;t say they were a &ldquo;mercenary&rdquo; type team.</p>

<p>To me it seems like most teams windows will just be very small and there will be a lot more luck-based results, Which can be fine for entertainment purposes. But I doubt a team like the Celtics this year is constructed again.</p>

      <label for="la34nzx" class="commentText"><p>It also means that it will be EXTREMELY  hard for any future players to break into the top tier of all time conversations because of how ring culture is</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever see a superstar with 5+ rings again with the new rules unless they blatantly ring chase from team to team their entire career</p>

<p>At some point just like we lowered the bar from Russell&rsquo;s 11 to say &ldquo;yeah but you don&rsquo;t ACTUALLY have to match that to be in the GOAT convo, it was so much easier to win back then&rdquo; we might have to do the same for MJ&rsquo;s 6 in the context of that it will be almost impossible for a player to win 6 on <em>one team</em> now</p>

<ul>

<p>Not true. Denver could only pay him around 11M a year, which was less than half than what he got.</p>

<p>If they let KCP go that&rsquo;s a choice, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case for Bruce</p>

      <label for="la40813" class="commentText"><p>Another important aspect is with the new TV deal the cap will go up the maximum 10% every year for like 5 years starting after next year if I’m remembering correctly. Which basically means Boston is committed to being a second apron team for only a couple years.</p>

<p>Jaylens extension kicks in starting this year. Jaysons and Derricks extensions would start in the 25-26 season when the cap starts going up 10%, but they would be signed based on the current cap number. If they both sign this off season which seems likely.</p>

<p>Basically Celtics ownership is committed to paying the tax for a few years to keep this core together understanding that it’ll get lighter in a few years, and the Celtics are only behind the warriors in terms of cap luck.</p>

They can sell off everyone but the Jays and still be a competitive team and B, the 2nd apron can cripple a franchise. No salary matching, no MLEs, draft picks frozen, no trade exceptions or cash moves. The 2nd apron basically makes it so you have to be the favorites to win a title or you’re screwed long term. Not just screwed long term “oh, we handed out some bad contracts” but screwed where you’re bad AND your draft pick is frozen to the end of the first round….so no tanking….</p>

NBA cap doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me sometimes</p>

<p>Same with the Knicks, everybody makes under 30mil a year on that team, including Randle and Brunson, and yet we have no cap space in a league that has teams with multiple players making 30, 40, 50+ mil a year</p>

<p>Their main stars are also young enoigh for them to not care as much about the hit theyd take if they were in the 2nd apron and their owners are willing to spend as much as needed to keep the team as it is rn.</p>

<p>The big issue with them is that MPJ makes about 6-10m a year than he should and they gave Zeke Ninaj a really dumb contract that overpays him.</p>

      <label for="la35kq5" class="commentText"><p>Celtics only have one guy on a max, although Tatum will make it two soon. Either way, they&rsquo;re just paying a lot to their 5 main guys and are willing and able to take the tax and apron implications due to how young and talented their main guys are along with having their picks still. The CBA will still hit them in some regard at some point but they&rsquo;re in quite possibly the best possible position you can be in while being a second apron team. Put simply, they don&rsquo;t need to make big trades to get better or fill out a bench, and the floor for what they need from the bench is much lower than is typical.</p>

<p>A lot of these other teams are not in that position. Nuggets desperately need a competent bench for when Jokic sits. Paying KCP hurts their ability to do that.</p>

      <label for="la3dvh8" class="commentText"><p>Because they’re not 5 max contracts.  Last year they only had Tatums rookie extension max contract.  I’m actually pretty sure the nuggets starting five made more than the Celtics starting five.  Murray made more than brown and mpj made more than tatum.  So that might be the nuggets problem lol.  Massive contracts for non all stars.</p>

<p>You should be aware that most actually want there to be another dynasty. People who say they like parity are kinda just lying to themselves tbh and the dynasty talk is gonna come with prety much every new champion going forward, as it has with the Celtics.</p>

      <label for="la3gshk" class="commentText"><p>If Denver was willing to sell him low in order to get off the contract, I feel like he’d be a great fit for OKC. He improves their size in the starting lineup, offers better rebounding and 3PT shooting than they have at that position, and his contract is expiring + not fully guaranteed in the year that Chet and Jalen get expensive.</p>

      <label for="la3xmlq" class="commentText"><p>The nuggets are a really weird team if you really look at them objectively.</p>

<p>Jokic deserves any amount of money he can get obviously and is one of the greatest players of all time, so he covers up for a lot of what I’m about to say and since they won a ring they don’t need to feel regret about anything.</p>

<p>But I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Yes, Jamal Murray has had amazing playoff moments but he’s the most overrated player in the NBA and is not really a max level player at all. The reality is the guy has never made an all star team and it’s never been a snub. He’s taking up a massive amount of cap for a sub all star level player who had some pretty bad performances in these playoffs that are more in line with his overall career performance than the playoff Murray moments he’s had in some recent post seasons.</p>

<p>MPJ is a really unique player and has value but he’s just no where near impactful enough to be getting a max. I get why they did it, but they’re feeling the hurt of it now.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the nuggets situation is what happens when <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of your max salaries are not really anywhere near max level talents. They won a chip last year of Jokic’s brilliance, but the talent around him isn’t really good enough. It just works because Jokic is so amazing that they all get great looks and he structures an offense perfectly.</p>

      <label for="la3kmqj" class="commentText"><p>Nuggs fans have been going over this nonstop over the last few weeks.  Ownership and FO mentioned being open to going into the 2nd apron during the end of season press conference, but I wonder if at the time this comment was made the focus was solely on consequences for next season without any consideration for how long they would be above the 2nd apron.  The issue is that Murray is eligible for a contract this offseason and Aaron Gordon next offseason.  I wonder if they have started to map out the cap over the next few years and come to the realization that they cannot keep all 4 of Murray, KCP, MPJ, and AG without being above the 2nd apron for several years in a row and just how incredibly debilitating that will be.  Even keeping 3 will be difficult to stay below 2nd apron on a yearly basis, but they would at least have a chance.  I love KCP and they don&rsquo;t win the first ever chip without him, but his skill set is the easiest to replace with what they already have on the roster (Braun is an excellent defender and Strawther can maybe replace some of the shooting).</p>
