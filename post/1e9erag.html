      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e9erag/just_how_far_could_i_make_it_in_the_nba_with_the/"><p>Just How Far Could I Make it in the NBA with the remote from Click (2006)?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My basketball abilities are quite limited to say the least. My short stature puts me a significant disadvantage and my athleticism is near non existent. Having to constantly run up and down and court as well as stay in front of players is certainly a large downside of mine, and my ability to block shots certainly isn’t much of an improvement. Basketball IQ and playmaking are other areas in which practice is certainly a necessity and my shooting touch leaves quite a bit to be desired. Although I did get Lasik surgery so perhaps court vision could be one area of expertise.</p>

<p>So why bring this all up? Why mention all my shortcomings as a basketball player? What is the purpose of this post? Well, simply put, I have but one inquiry. Let’s say by some otherworldly magic I manage to gain hold on the remote control from Click (2006)? For those unfamiliar, Click (2006) is a comedy film starring Adam Sandler (1966) displaying a story about a melancholic family man who gains control of a device capable of controlling reality. The remote control is capable of muting others, and fast forwarding time. (I think I haven’t seen the movie in quite some time). Why mention the plot of an 18 year old movie you might ask? Well for the sake of the argument let’s say the magic remote is also capable of pausing and reversing time. Let’s say that I manage to gain ahold of this magical device and using its infinite power, I use it to control reality and make things profitable for myself.</p>

<p>So the question now becomes, with the aid of this magic universal remote, capable of controlling reality with the ability to pause and resume time, fast forward as well as reverse, just how far could a 5’7 Mexican American Male make it in the NBA?</p>

<p>Let’s say I’m guarding Luka Doncic, an NBA superstar capable of making some of the craziest and most unique passes you’ve ever seen. As Luka makes an insane pass to an open teammate who no one seemed to notice, I manage to reverse time using the remote and am able to enter the passing lane for this seemingly improbable pass and thus make the steal leading to a fast break.</p>

<p>Let’s say I’m open in the corner during a close game and they pass me the ball and I shoot a 3 Pointer to tie the game. Obviously with my basketball prowess this would most likely be a huge airball, but with the powers of the remote I am able to reverse time and attempt again. Oh what’s that I missed another 3? Well just dust myself off and try again. Oh what’s that I missed another 3? Well I’ll just give it one more go and this cycle would repeat a handful of times until I can finally make the shot with ease.</p>

<p>Now obviously as crazy as this idea sounds and as powerful as I would be with said remote, there may be some things which I cannot control. Obviously no amount of pausing and reversing or even fast forwarding for that matter would be able to stop an Anthony Edwards dunk or a LeBron fast break or a Curry 3 pointer, and my shot blocking would still leave some to be desired as my ability to pause time would not allow for better athleticism. In a league full of genetic freaks and absolute power units of basketball all being well over 6’0 tall, as much as an advantage this would give, my dominance would certainly not reach its limit considering my varying other weaknesses. But overall what would my ceiling be? The Most Valuable Player award and All NBA team selections would most likely be a little too out of reach for someone such as myself, but perhaps Sixth Man of the Year would be well within reach such as Defensive Player of the Year as I would use my powers to help stop various plays.</p>

<p>Now you may be asking “Well with all this power would it not be more important to reverse engineer this device and understand the technology behind that and use that science to help further and advance humanity rather than use it for your own personal gain?” To which I would say well yes of course I would get around to doing that but achieving my dream of becoming an NBA player comes first as well as I could just reverse time and then do all my world saving later.</p>

<p>All in all, this question poses various moral implications such as “Are you even skilled considering you would just get multiple attempts?” or “What makes you think you should be the only one to wield this power?” but we are not here to talk morals, we are here to talk ball. So once again I ask you all, As a 5’7 Mexican American male, just how far could I make it in today’s NBA utilizing the remote from Click (2006)?</p>

<p>Pity. You&rsquo;re clever. I believe you wrote the title and the LLM- prompt. You could clearly have come up with-and written- something as good as or better than this. But for anyone who&rsquo;s spent much time working with LLMs, this screams AI, and you&rsquo;re trying to defend it and edit it ex post facto as if it&rsquo;s the work of a human.</p>

Eventually even an easy shot is going to be missed.

Maybe even break try and break some records. Out score Wilts 100 point game, make more than 14 threes to break Klays record, or even break Scott Skiles record of 30 assists by passing to shooters and rewinding until they make the shot.<br>
The possibilities are endless depending on how dedicated you are to becoming the greatest player of all time at just 5’7” lmao</p>

<p>Heck you&rsquo;re &ldquo;No dunks allowed any open shot doesn&rsquo;t need to be contested&rdquo; defense will give your players rest and baffle staticians for decades.</p>

Adam Sandlers character learned it the hard way when it fast forwarded through his entire life causing him to miss his children&rsquo;s youth. Also the movie had one of the saddest scene I&rsquo;ve ever seen in film, yet also had a scene where Sandler paused time to fart in his boss face.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d be an amazing freakish basketballer but would eventually be stuck in a groundhog day loop as the remote automatically replays every game for you. You&rsquo;d end up stuck in a single game where you&rsquo;d know every play and be a 100 point scorer/lockdown defender but would never be able to leave it. Forced into a Neverending hellish limbo existence</p>

      <label for="ledza2x" class="commentText"><p>Sure I think you would do well in games but you’re going to burn yourself out also have to perform in practice.  Imagine doing 3 point shooting drills but if you suck that would be like a 20 hour session with what may normally be 30 minutes because you have to show coaches and teammates you’re elite.  Your body would be a wreck and then do it at full game pace even with stop and pause and rewind.</p>

<p>Also, I think we are discounting that players can adjust. If that pass Luka made you read, he’ll see on the next go that you’re reading it and he will adjust on the fly, that’s why he’s elite.</p>

      <label for="ledvl26" class="commentText"><p>Considering that you would mainly play on the perimeter and go in for drives when there is an open lane, you could probably thrive as a TJ McConnell type of player. That being said, defensive players have good IQ so they would already know a lot of your moves considering that you don’t have a fast first step. I would say you would have to reverse time a minimum 5 times per possession before you nail a move.</p>

<p>This all hinges on the logic that everyone’s movements are premeditated. Who’s to say that teammates and opponents will always do the same thing after every reset? I like to think of the aftermath as a random seed in a game world, the actions of characters are random after every time you reverse time. Teammates could stay on the perimeter or they can cut to the basket. Opponents can foul you or they can block/steal the ball</p>

You can go back and view past events in person, but you can’t change what happened. So many non click heads in here smh.</p>

<p>I’d say the best use of the remote would be to pause, steal and unpause when you’re under the basket alone, or put it in slow motion and outrun everybody.</p>

      <label for="lee2m47" class="commentText"><p>On offense ud be a monster, but I think defense would be another story. If u can get to where Luka passes the ball in time cause u can just pause, who&rsquo;s to say Luka still makes that pass. He&rsquo;s reaction speed can cause him to just choose another alternate play, and then ud have to account for that one and since it so small if never be able to be there, and when ur now accounting for this new alternate play where, for instance, he&rsquo;s now going to shoot, he would just react AGAIN and pass the ball like originally intending. Tho on offense ud just be able to shoot half courts repeatedly until it goes in.</p>

      <label for="leef6lw" class="commentText"><p>You can just pause it every time someone dribbles and then walk up to them, put your hands on the ball, and then unpause and you’ll get a steal every play.</p>

<p>You can also just pause midway through the inbound pass, stand in front of the ball, and then unpause and you get possession (though there’s a good chance you’d lose it at that point).</p>

<p>You’d easily be the DPOY and you will guaranteed shut out the other team.</p>

      <label for="leekayj" class="commentText"><p>You seem to only be focusing on the rewind function of the remote. There’s also pause- a power that I would argue is much greater than an unlimited mulligan button.</p>

<p>You cite not being able to stop an Edwards dunk, a LeBron fast break or a Curry 3. If you’re limiting yourself to the rewind button, sure, you’ll probably lose those situations 100 times out of 100.</p>

<p>However, with the pause functionality of the remote, you don’t need to. If Ant is going up for a dunk, you simply need to look like you’re effecting the play, pause time, and move the ball so it just squirts away from him. Analysts will marvel at your ability to affect players mentally.</p>

<p>Whats more, you don’t need to attempt unlimited threes until one drops. Pause time, grab a ladder that you stash nearby, and adjust the flight path of your shot so it goes in. Analysts will marvel at your ability to curve your shots, not just shooting accurately, but around the defense. Hell, you might get your own Bend It Like Beckham spinoff.</p>

<p>As for how far you can go, the sky is the limit. You’re capping yourself at sixth man of the year. I’d put your limit at undisputed greatest to ever lace them up.</p>

There is no rewind-and-do-it-differently. Rewind is just replay of what happened. The limitations of the technology are a pretty big part of the movie. You&rsquo;re basically talking about having a pocket-sized time machine in your scenario.</p>

<p>If you ACTUALLY had the remote from Click, slow motion and pause are the most useful function. You could pause time to develop your skills. You could use slow motion to speed around opponents for easy layups. You could use pause to get breathers so you can plan your next move, and stay fresh for long games. Without athletic giftedness, you&rsquo;d still probably never get good enough to make the NBA.</p>

<p>You could just pause every time you get beat (virtually every play) and then “almost” steal the ball and then unpause so you get unlimited guaranteed possessions.</p>

<p>Then you can pause again, walk town the court, and cherry pick a 3 (rewind if you miss).</p>

<p>You’ll shoot 100% from 3 on like 40 shots a game and you’ll steal the ball every possession.</p>

      <label for="leeen16" class="commentText"><p>Defensively it&rsquo;d be tough, players make decisions in microseconds so even though one play they make a certain pass, if you tried to get in position to be close to intercept that pass that player may make a different decision in that second and maybe drive/shoot or pass to someone else. Shooting 100% would be nice but how does the remote work? Do you just transport into that moment or do you have to press something and then resume your stance. Cameras would notice you glitching around if you had to press start and then assume a &lsquo;similar&rsquo; but not exact position you were at. But I guess if you are just transferred to that position in time exactly as you were, with your remote in your pants then youd be good. You wouldnt even need to have the remote on you, just on the bench. Each reality ppl would be like &lsquo;wtf y you going to the bench in the middle of the game&rsquo; but you could press pause, set the exact time and jump into that reality &amp; try again. You could do that defensively and with enough tries you would get that stop too. Youd be able to get long rebounds better than anyone too, so with enough time and practice you should easily average 10 steals, 10 boards, 10+ points trible double, first of its kind. Maybe some games that you put a ton of pauses/reverses into you could get the first penta-double game because with that kind of power you can eventually, with enough time, keep redoing each moment until its favourable in getting your goal. I think its possible but your own motivation may get drained if it took so many attempts and you may choose to do something different in the end.</p>

<p>Even if you could, it&rsquo;s almost a Sisyphean task to just make it to the NBA. Given that you are currently 5&rsquo;7&rdquo; and not good at basketball, that&rsquo;s a long way till a pro, let alone make it to the highest level. You will probably need to get on/notice with a pro-am team/tournament, get a walk-up opportunity with a G-league/foreign team, then maybe get a shot at a 2-way/1 year.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s hundreds of games and probably 5~10x more scrimmage to get in the league, even if you are somehow a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; player. Sure, you can rewind every possession, every play, and try it 100~1000 times to get right. But how mentally taxing is that? Everybody&rsquo;s playing 48 minutes max, but you&rsquo;ll be playing a 100 hours in your mind. Film sessions and mind games are very exhausting. And you will need 100X+ of what pros have to put in.</p>

<p>Why would anyone do that when they have the power to win the lottery and chill on a paradise island? Maybe if you are a psycho like Joe Mazzulla.</p>

      <label for="leeg3dl" class="commentText"><p>Honestly you probably don&rsquo;t make it far. The drawback of the remote is that time eventually has to catch up.so at some point in your life things are gonna fly by without your input. You gotta pause responsibly.</p>

<p>Also you need witnesses to affect the game. You can&rsquo;t just pause, score 50 layups and then play with a 100 pt lead. No one saw those layups go in. If you paused and fucked with the scoreboard, there would be an immediate game stoppage to address a &ldquo;technical issue&rdquo; in the equipment.</p>

<p>So maybe you could pause, steal the ball, get right under the basket, press play and score the layup. But you&rsquo;re gonna look like a teleporter to everyone else and people are gonna freak out.</p>

      <label for="leeh28o" class="commentText"><p>I haven’t seen Click in a while but an effective approach may be some sort of flickering pause/start action. This would make you seem more plausible for replays (instead of teleporting). With some practice, you could essentially be super humanly fast and only do layups with 100% success.</p>

<p>This would also skirt issues posed in practice shooting drills. You can just shoot horribly and only do the skip for speed related things. Basically you would be a player that sucks, but is somehow the world’s fastest person by far.</p>

<p>While weird, if you scored 50ppg on 100% fg, do you think coach will be criticizing you for practicing shooting poorly? They will just be confused, especially when defensive substitutions or schemes have no effect whatsoever.</p>

<p>Over time, this would still age you. So I think best case, you do this till you get max extension, then you stop and crap out of the league with the “yips”</p>

      <label for="leejfp5" class="commentText"><p>Can’t you slow down time with the remote? You could probably just play the game at half speed and pause when you need to for a steal or good pass. You also wouldn’t have to worry about getting tired as often.</p>

<p>The most difficult thing is not being banned from the league when game tape is reviewed. It will look like that scene from the incredibles when dash pranks his teacher</p>

      <label for="leejk77" class="commentText"><p>I think like others have said you can pause and rewind your way into a decent career. However, you may die of old age before completing a full season with all the pausing and rewinding.</p>

<p>I think you could be the greatest coach of all time though, knowing every play before it happens. Being as the NBA keeps most games close for 3 quarters you could leave the remote out until the 4th quarter and maybe only lose hours of your life per game vs days / weeks / months.</p>

      <label for="leeb7x9" class="commentText"><p>With the remote from &ldquo;Click,&rdquo; you could theoretically make it quite far in the NBA despite your physical and skill limitations. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Defensive Impact</strong>: You could use the remote to pause time and reposition yourself defensively, making it nearly impossible for opponents to get past you or make uncontested shots. This would significantly boost your defensive stats, potentially earning you recognition as an elite defender.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Offensive Efficiency</strong>: On offense, you could pause or rewind time to perfect your shooting form and ensure that every shot goes in. This would drastically improve your shooting percentage, making you a valuable scorer, especially from the three-point line.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Basketball IQ and Playmaking</strong>: By rewinding and reattempting plays, you could develop an almost perfect basketball IQ, always making the right decisions and passes. You could anticipate opponents&rsquo; moves and react perfectly every time, increasing your assist numbers and reducing turnovers.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Clutch Performance</strong>: In critical moments, you could ensure that you make game-winning shots or defensive stops by pausing and retrying until you succeed. This would build your reputation as a clutch player.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, there are limitations and potential downsides:</p>
