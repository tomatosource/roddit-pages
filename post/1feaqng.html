      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1feaqng/who_would_become_even_more_dominant_if_they/"><p>Who would become even more dominant if they became a 40% 3 point shooter on good volume? Shaq or Giannis?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think it&rsquo;s a worthy question. Both are very dominant players - everyone knows about Shaq&rsquo;s dominance, and Giannis just averaged essentially 31-11-6 on 60% from the field. Giannis in particular had a season where he shot horribly from basically anything beyond 5 feet, and since he&rsquo;s a player with perimeter abilities, having a 40% 3 pointer would make him damn near unstoppable.</p>

<p>But so would Shaq. I feel like Shaq shooting 40% from 3 in his era would have actually broken the league and there would be government intervention to change NBA rules to stop him from scoring 40 a game. Because a Kobe/Shaq PnR with him having the ability to pop out and shoot 40% from 3 would be fucking nutty lmao.</p>

      <label for="lmlunoh" class="commentText"><p>I think the easy thought would be Shaq, because he just overall was the more dominant player, but I’d agree with you that it helps Giannis more. Better handle, speed, and agility to weaponize a 3 to attack the basket. Then frankly, Shaq shooting 3s, even at 40%, is kind of a win for the defense because he’s not beating up/fouling out your big men every possession.</p>

      <label for="lmlue7c" class="commentText"><p>The thing is, Shaq shooting 40% from 3 doesn&rsquo;t really help him actually. He was so dominant in the paint that he was <em>more</em> efficient than shooting 40% from 3.</p>

<p>Shooting 40% from 3 would have actually made Shaq <em>less efficient</em>, although it probably means less free throw shooting for him.</p>

<p>Giannis, on the other hand, has to create his interior scoring with slashing. Being able to shoot 40% from 3 completely opens up the floor for him.</p>

      <label for="lmlvzdg" class="commentText"><p>Shaq without question. He was a cheat code, and even though he did it a little with the 00&rsquo; Lakers, he was definitely sprinting down the court with Orlando. A prime Shaq with a 3 point game would have been un fair. He was an automatic bucket under the rim with his sheer strength, and giving him a 3 point shot to go along with that crazy power? The man would be Thanos with all the infinity stones. Straight diabolical work. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Giannis would be just as lethal, but not as terrifying as Shaq.</p>

      <label for="lmlvekj" class="commentText"><p>I think shooting 3s in volume would change Shaqs game too much. He was dominant on the inside &amp; if he started taking more 3s, it would change his aggressiveness inside, especially for the era he played in. KAT is a great shooter,  but we&rsquo;ve all seen Shaq constantly berate him for settling for a 3 because it weakens his inside game too much.</p>

<p>Giannis, on the other hand, already takes a couple of 3s per game and operates in more areas of the court than Shaq did. Boosting his efficiency would only make him much better at what he&rsquo;s already doing without having to change the core way he plays.</p>

      <label for="lmlx5zk" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think shooting 40% from 3 helps Shaq as much as you might think. It was already easy to get him shots (just dump it into the post), and he was already shooting nearly 60%, so it doesn’t really increase his volume or efficiency by that much. He now has two ways to kill you, but he can only use one of them at a time, and they don’t really synergize.</p>

<p>Giannis is more of a rim attacker than a back to the basket player, so I think he’d be better at blowing by the hard close outs. A three point shot would open things up for him in a way that Shaq would have more trouble capitalizing on.</p>

      <label for="lmlxc8x" class="commentText"><p>Shaq averaged something like 1.5 points per attempt at the rim (not counting fouls), which is significantly more than averaging 40% from 3 is worth (1.2 points per attempt). Shaq shooting 80% from the line would probably be more transformational to his game than shooting 40% from 3, oddly enough.</p>

<p>Giannis&rsquo; prime game is built much more on driving to the rim than Shaq&rsquo;s was, so the defense having to closeout hard to Giannis would completely alter his offensive impact and would likely make him one of the best offensive players ever.</p>

<p>Giannis would see the most gains from a real outside shot.</p>

      <label for="lmlxnzj" class="commentText"><p>Shaq because if you had to press up on a shaq p&amp;r worried not only about the guard coming off but also him floating out so many open attempts would happen behind the play. Not to mention that shaq could go ahead and attack that space off the ball. Also his guard would more often have an open lane as the big couldn’t sag as often</p>

      <label for="lmlyl11" class="commentText"><p>Giannis. You don&rsquo;t want to take Shaq out of the paint, and if he is shooting and you close our hard he doesn&rsquo;t have the ball skills to really effectively take advantage. It just doesn&rsquo;t synergize with his game.</p>

<p>Giannis on the other hand already plays on the perimeter, and if you bite on a pump fake you&rsquo;re BBQ chicken.</p>
