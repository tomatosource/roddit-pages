      <label for="liktnut" class="commentText"><p>Yes, Chicago is in-bounding with 42 seconds to go. It&rsquo;s a must score and a must score relatively quickly as you don&rsquo;t want it to get down to under 30 seconds with the Jazz in bounding with a 24 second shot clock. That super quick score to set up the steal/score always gets a bit overlooked.</p>

      <label for="lilhmai" class="commentText"><p>That doesn&rsquo;t get talked about enough. Jazz were probably the best team that year (won 61 games) and won the opener of that series surviving a 47 point performance by Hakeem and were up 2-1. Malone was eating the Rockets alive cause the Rockets didn&rsquo;t have a literal power forward (Horry played the three in those days cause he was much skinnier, they traded Thorpe for Clyde, and their backup power forward Hererra got injured the first playoff game). Oh to top it all off, their sixth man Vernon Maxwell had like a mental breakdown after losing game 1 to the Jazz and literally quit the team.</p>

<p>The Jazz had a 7 point lead at home in that &ldquo;win to advance or lose to get eliminated&rdquo; home game five with five minutes left but still lost. Then again that same Rockets team was also down 3-1 on the road and the Suns were up by one with 20 seconds left and Barkley had two free throws&ndash;Chuck missed a critical one. Olajuwon hit a tough fadeaway to tie it and then the Suns missed an open three at the buzzer to win the series where Olajuwon and Horry dominated in OT to stave off elimination. Oh and did I mention Drexler had the flu and scored like four points on 1 out of 10 shooting? Then in the game 7, piece of shit Kevin Johnson had like 46 points and 10 assists; the Suns were up by 15 at halftime but the Rockets still won&hellip;absolutely insane</p>

      <label for="lil5q1x" class="commentText"><p>Literally no other Chicago Bull touched the ball in the final 80 seconds&ndash;on <em>either side of the floor</em>&ndash; besides Harper maybe getting a fingertip on Stockton&rsquo;s final three pointer. Pippen had no business being on the floor due to his back injury and Rodman was getting torched by Karl Malone the last few games who seemed to be finally overcoming his playoff letdowns. Jordan scored over half of Chicago&rsquo;s points&ndash;scored the final eight points for the Bulls in the last 1:40&ndash; he created a win out of absolutely nothing. It wasn&rsquo;t the most pretty but the man simply wasn&rsquo;t being denied that night and was gonna somehow find a way&ndash;he knew the Bulls had very little chance of winning a Game 7 so the series had to be won tonight. It&rsquo;s quite similar to how the Bulls threepeated the first time. Game 6 on the road&ndash;after losing a game 5 at home- with a go-ahead shot in the final five seconds where Jordan scored the vast majority of the fourth quarter points.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Jordan, at 35, in the 1998 playoffs scored the highest percentage of a championship team&rsquo;s playoff points in NBA history.</p>

      <label for="lillsl4" class="commentText"><p>So this was all planned.  Phil told MJ to get a quick bucket and that’s the quick layup. He also told him that Karl would be getting the ball in the post/block and to knock it loose.</p>

<p>Phil also told MJ to follow through on his shot - that’s why he held the follow throuh on the last shot(if I remember right Phil told him he was coming up short or something). Best player ever, and in a game 6 of the championship there’s a reminder on basic fundamentals. Just says a lot about them</p>

<p>They envisioned and planned for it all. They executed as a team and that’s what made them great, and arguably the best team ever</p>

      <label for="lil0iqo" class="commentText"><p>No, the Wizards were already terrible before Jordan became a Minority Owner. They finished in last place in their division and fired their coach mid-way through the lockout season and sucked even more the next season when Jordan became owner in February of 2000, and to make matters worse they traded their 2000 1st round pick like six years earlier.</p>

<p>Jordan had to divest his ownership stake to become a player. It was about the &ldquo;itch&rdquo;, not everything is some bigger meta narrative you wrote in your head.</p>

      <label for="lil814g" class="commentText"><p>Most athletes don&rsquo;t really care about that though. Brady is another good example. By their nature, most elite athletes want to play until they can&rsquo;t anymore. Players that retire after a championship usaully only do so because they were more or less carried to the Ring (e.g. Peyton Manning or David Robinson).</p>

<p>Even in The Last Dance, Jordan admits that not coming back to attempt #7 ate at him and retiring while he was still on top was frustrating. He wanted to play until he got knocked off the pedestal. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Jordan would have loved to have more success in Washington, but my guess is that he&rsquo;s really glad he got to come back and compete even after being surpassed by the next generation. </p>

      <label for="lil7nje" class="commentText"><p>He was super rusty coming into his first season with the team after three years of no NBA play and partying. He fractured his ribs during his summer of 2001 workout to gear up for the season. Ron Artest (who was working out with MJ in Chicago) says MJ would have led the league in scoring if this never happened. And the team was abysmal; they were the worst team the season before and had like a 6-16 record without him. But he improved as the season went along. At age 39, he was averaging 26-6-6 on 46% from the field in the final 17 games before his knee injury in that first season with the Wizards; only sixth year, 23 year old Kobe Byrant was putting up those type of numbers.</p>

<p>There was this game against the Raptors where Vince Carter dominated and scored like 24 in the first half. The second half&ndash;Wizards head coach Doug Collins gives Jordan the defensive assignment and Carter goes 0 for 7 in the second half.</p>

Also, people remember that he totally fucked up his finger on his right hand in a cigar cutting accident.</p>
