      <label for="liktnut" class="commentText"><p>Yes, Chicago is in-bounding with 42 seconds to go. It&rsquo;s a must score and a must score relatively quickly as you don&rsquo;t want it to get down to under 30 seconds with the Jazz in bounding with a 24 second shot clock. That super quick score to set up the steal/score always gets a bit overlooked.</p>

Pippen had no business being on the floor due to his back injury and Rodman was getting torched by Karl Malone the few games. Jordan scored over half of Chicago&rsquo;s points; he created a win out of absolutely nothing. It wasn&rsquo;t the most pretty but the man simply wasn&rsquo;t being denied that night and was gonna somehow find a way.</p>

<p>Him even playing 2 seasons was crazy considering how banged up he was. Mutilated finger on his shooting hand (which is still messed up today), broken ribs beginning the season, then the knee injury that basically ended his season</p>

<p>He was a far cry from “Jordan’s” level but prior to his knee injury still put up an AllStar worthy season in the toughest defensive period in NBA history</p>

They finished in last place in their division and fired their coach mid-way through the lockout season and sucked even more the next season when Jordan became owner in February of 2000, and to make matters worse they traded their 2000 1st round pick like six years earlier.</p>

<p>Jordan had to divest his ownership stake to become a player. It was about the &ldquo;itch&rdquo;, not everything is some bigger meta narrative you wrote in your head.</p>

      <label for="lil814g" class="commentText"><p>Most athletes don&rsquo;t really care about that though. Brady is another good example. By their nature, most elite athletes want to play until they can&rsquo;t anymore. Players that retire after a championship usaully only do so because they were more or less carried to the Ring (e.g. Peyton Manning or David Robinson).</p>

<p>Even in The Last Dance, Jordan admits that not coming back to attempt #7 ate at him and retiring while he was still on top was frustrating. He wanted to play until he got knocked off the pedestal. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Jordan would have loved to have more success in Washington, but my guess is that he&rsquo;s really glad he got to come back and compete even after being surpassed by the next generation. </p>

      <label for="lil7nje" class="commentText"><p>He was super rusty coming into his first season with the team after three years of no NBA play and partying. He fractured his ribs during his summer of 2001 workout to gear up for the season. Ron Artest (who was working out with MJ in Chicago) says MJ would have led the league in scoring if this never happened. And the team was abysmal; they were the worst team the season before and had like a 6-16 record without him. But he improved as the season went along. At age 39, he was averaging 26-6-6 on 46% from the field in the final 17 games before his knee injury in that first season with the Wizards; only sixth year, 23 year old Kobe Byrant was putting up those type of numbers.</p>

<p>There was this game against the Raptors where Vince Carter dominated and scored like 24 in the first half. The second half&ndash;Wizards head coach Doug Collins gives Jordan the defensive assignment and Carter goes 0 for 7 in the second half.</p>

      <label for="likul15" class="commentText"><p>I saw this live (grew up watching NBA in the 80s) and as amazing as it was, to everyone it was just another day at the office for MJ. As if anything else could have possibly happened other than MJ being instrumental in a win. Bucket steal and game winner? That’s nice.</p>

<p>This is why MJ is the goat. He did this ALL THE TIME to the point where you expected it.</p>
