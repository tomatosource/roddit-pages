      <label for="liktnut" class="commentText"><p>Yes, Chicago is in-bounding with 42 seconds to go. It&rsquo;s a must score and a must score relatively quickly as you don&rsquo;t want it to get down to under 30 seconds with the Jazz in bounding with a 24 second shot clock. That super quick score to set up the steal/score always gets a bit overlooked.</p>

Pippen had no business being on the floor due to his back injury and Rodman was getting torched by Karl Malone the last few games who seemed to be finally overcoming his playoff letdowns. Jordan scored over half of Chicago&rsquo;s points&ndash;scored the final eight points for the Bulls in the last 1:40&ndash; he created a win out of absolutely nothing. It wasn&rsquo;t the most pretty but the man simply wasn&rsquo;t being denied that night and was gonna somehow find a way&ndash;he knew the Bulls had very little chance of winning a Game 7 so the series had to be won tonight. It&rsquo;s quite similar to how the Bulls threepeated the first time. Game 6 on the road&ndash;after losing a game 5 at home- with a go-ahead shot in the final five seconds where Jordan scored the vast majority of the fourth quarter points. That&rsquo;s GOAT stuff.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Jordan, at 35, in the 1998 playoffs scored the highest percentage of a championship team&rsquo;s playoff points in NBA history.</p>

      <label for="lin38sw" class="commentText"><p>New generations don&rsquo;t understand what people are talking about when they mention Jordan&rsquo;s &ldquo;aura&rdquo;, but this is what it&rsquo;s all about. In his prime years with Bulls, MJ was almost a mythical figure, he would just personally take over and always find a way to win in the end. Other teams could feel like they are fighting a futile war.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget how insanely hard to do a single 3-peat: it took Shaq and Kobe, two top 10 all time together in their prime to do it once. Two of the most scary superteams in 21st century, the Heatles and KD-Steph Warriors, was only able to do a back to back run and couldn&rsquo;t finish on the third year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile MJ somehow did it twice with two drastically different Bulls team. That 1998 Bulls team on paper especially has no business winning the title that year, they were on a brink of collapse because of internal drama, Pippen and Rodman was shells of their former selves because of injury and age, and Jazz looked better than ever with two superstars in their prime. MJ kinda personally will that championship into existence.</p>

<p>LeBron had some of that invincible aura, but only against Eastern teams which were substantially worse than West during most of his prime years. MJ&rsquo;s aura towers over the entire generation of 90&rsquo;s basketball.</p>

      <label for="lis56ip" class="commentText"><p>Stockton no, but Malone yes. Malone was a weird player with an insanely long peak (11x first team all nbas, multiple 1st and 2nd all defense teams too) that were mostly throughout his 30s, and he really didn’t perfect his long range jumper until ~<sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>31</sub>. He won his MVPs at 33 and 35 years old respectively and his best years were between 30-40.</p>

<p>Even in his final year at age 40 on the lakers, he was averaging over 20 ppg quite efficiently. Ppl talk about lebrons durability but Malone was kinda a special case of physical freak in an era of no load management, much less sports science when it comes to body recovery - and was just built like a brick shit house.</p>

<p>Shitty person and all but he was a genetic athletic freak, daughter went to the wnba and his “illegitimate” son played in the nfl</p>

<p>A team with Jordan himself, Pippen, Rodman, Kukoc and Harper is a contender in any timeline in any era. Of course he was THE guy, the best to ever be THE guy if you ask me, but lets not act like he was playing with scrubs just because they were declining. </p>

<p>And Malone and Stockton were in their mid-30s - still effective, still elite, but absolutely NOT in their primes, with their 3rd best player being… Jeff Hornacek. (Also, Karl Malone was a serial playoff dropper and no one ever talks about this)</p>

      <label for="lis9grt" class="commentText"><p>Let’s not do revisionist history here. When Harper joined the Bulls he was supposed to be washed up. When MJ returned they made him the PG only for defensive reasons, so they would have a tall lineup that could switch everything on the perimeter. He was nothing like the Cavs Harper many years before.</p>

<p>Kerr was a bench warmer in Cleveland, Rodman was traded for Perdue and Dele took most of his Finals minutes in 97 already. He couldn’t stop Malone at this point. Longley was a draft bust in Minnesota. People today keep calling Bulls some super team, when they were sub .500 when MJ returned and were ranked fourth in the East by experts when 95-96 season started.</p>

<p>Just goes to show you that maybe high assist numbers and dominating the ball for individual stats isn’t the only way to make your teammates better.</p>

      <label for="lioktml" class="commentText"><p>TL;DR:  Oops! Reminiscing on 97-98, Jordan, etc</p>

<p>I remember sitting on the floor in front of the TV with full confidence in Jordan.  It was a bittersweet happiness.  It&rsquo;s hard to explain, but I&rsquo;ll try. When he left the Bulls, those formative awkward middle-school days arrived, and I stopped watching sports for years.  Rediscovering basketball later in life mended a bridge within me. I lacked confidence in my potential, so I faced an old fear of playing again–being with others. Sure, I ran into my own teammates, but I had fun. Just being on the court was enough.  I loved shooting by myself near closing time, too.  I&rsquo;d tune everything out and abide in the moment.  Jordan represented this ideal of greatness I thought impossible to bother reaching for.  I was so very wrong. The game/life teaches everyone in their own unique way.  Jordan showed me sustained greatness, but what I had to learn was accepting my failures in order to grow as a person.  I didn&rsquo;t need to <em>be like Mike</em> I needed to be <em>me.</em></p>

Jazz were probably the best team that year (won 61 games) and won the opener of that series surviving a 47 point performance by Hakeem and were up 2-1. Malone was eating the Rockets alive cause the Rockets didn&rsquo;t have a literal power forward (Horry played the three in those days cause he was much skinnier, they traded Thorpe for Clyde, and their backup power forward Hererra got injured the first playoff game). Oh to top it all off, their sixth man Vernon Maxwell had like a mental breakdown after losing game 1 to the Jazz and literally quit the team.</p>

<p>The Jazz had a 7 point lead at home in that &ldquo;win to advance or lose to get eliminated&rdquo; home game five with five minutes left but still lost. Then again that same Rockets team was also down 3-1 on the road and the Suns were up by one with 20 seconds left and Barkley had two free throws&ndash;Chuck missed a critical one. Olajuwon hit a tough fadeaway to tie it and then the Suns missed an open three at the buzzer to win the series where Olajuwon and Horry dominated in OT to stave off elimination. Oh and did I mention Drexler had the flu and scored like four points on 1 out of 10 shooting? Then in the game 7, piece of shit Kevin Johnson had like 46 points and 10 assists; the Suns were up by 15 at halftime but the Rockets still won&hellip;absolutely insane</p>

      <label for="lillsl4" class="commentText"><p>So this was all planned.  Phil told MJ to get a quick bucket and that’s the quick layup. He also told him that Karl would be getting the ball in the post/block and to knock it loose.</p>

<p>Phil also told MJ to follow through on his shot - that’s why he held the follow throuh on the last shot(if I remember right Phil told him he was coming up short or something). Best player ever, and in a game 6 of the championship there’s a reminder on basic fundamentals. Just says a lot about them</p>

<p>They envisioned and planned for it all. They executed as a team and that’s what made them great, and arguably the best team ever</p>

Shot like 48% true shooting with a semi-decent amount of turnovers the first six games until his awesome game 7), Duncan had a humiliating sweep against the 2001 Lakers as the number 1 overall seed, Magic has the &ldquo;tragic johnson&rdquo; stuff+ the stunning loss to the 1990 suns , Shaq got outplayed by Hakeem in the 1995 finals along with six of seven consecutive postseasons where he got swept, Bird got badly swept by the Bucks team that won six less games than the Celtics did, Kobe had those 2004+2008 lackluster finals performances, Kareem has gotten outplayed by centers such as Nate Thurmond+Moses Malone in multiple playoff series. Closest is MJ losing to Magic (who were slightly favored btw) where he still had a really good series without homecourt advantage and he absolutely was in baseball shape not basketball shape after not playing NBA basketball for 21 months. The man never lost a series with homecourt.</p>

      <label for="lilyi04" class="commentText"><p>This is definitely rewriting history.  Vegas had Bulls winning a chip that year.  MJ was coming off baseball, yes, but his stats were better than any previous playoffs he had ever had, ever, period.  MJ could not get past Shaq that series.  He shot twice as much as any player on the court, so it is 100% his fault and the baseball thing doesn&rsquo;t fly cause his stats say otherwise, go ahead, look it up, his stats were all better than ALL previous playoffs.  The second the Bulls lost 4-1 to the Magic, the sport heads started making excuses, I remember, and I have always been a Jordan fan, only jersey I ever owned, but they immediately began making excuses for the gentlemen sweep.</p>

<p>If that isn&rsquo;t enough for you, he got swept twice by Bird and we can look at Wizards.  I love Jordan, but this fairytale shit has to stop for true bball fans.</p>

Do break the all time regular season win record in his first season bsck when there were a lot of doubts if MJ would regain his early 90’s form with another three peat is absolutely fairy tale shit. The 98 Bulls are still the oldest team ever to win a title.</p>

<p>No, his advanced stats were worse cause he had an increased turnover percentage. 1993 per was 30.3 with 2.7 VORP with a 11.7 BPM with a .271 win share. 1995 per was 24.8, with a 1.0 VORP,  8.0 BPM, with .150 win share. 1996 per was 26.7 with a 2.4 VORP, 10.7 BPM, with a .306 win share.</p>

<p>they lost 4-2 not 4-1 and two of their losses were super close . what lol?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>lol, he averaged 36-7-6 on 59% true shooting in those two sweeps against a 67 win and 60 win team with nobody close to being an all-star on his squad. would haven&rsquo;t been swept the first time if nba gave three free thows when you&rsquo;re fouled behind the line in those days too (he got fouled taking a three pointer at the end of the first ot and made both to send it to a second ot). And if we&rsquo;re gonna hold this against him, then there&rsquo;s an astronomically stronger case for holding it against lebron making the finals after beating two 41 win teams (including wizards missing their two best players and the worst pistons team during that billups hamiltion sheed era) then getting swept in 2007 by a 58 win spurs team after that benefited from a highly controversial suspension against amare+diaw&hellip;lebron in that series had a ts% 43 with like six turnovers per game.</p>

      <label for="lil814g" class="commentText"><p>Most athletes don&rsquo;t really care about that though. Brady is another good example. By their nature, most elite athletes want to play until they can&rsquo;t anymore. Players that retire after a championship usaully only do so because they were more or less carried to the Ring (e.g. Peyton Manning or David Robinson).</p>

<p>Even in The Last Dance, Jordan admits that not coming back to attempt #7 ate at him and retiring while he was still on top was frustrating. He wanted to play until he got knocked off the pedestal. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Jordan would have loved to have more success in Washington, but my guess is that he&rsquo;s really glad he got to come back and compete even after being surpassed by the next generation. </p>

      <label for="lil7nje" class="commentText"><p>He was super rusty coming into his first season with the team after three years of no NBA play and partying. He fractured his ribs during his summer of 2001 workout to gear up for the season. Ron Artest (who was working out with MJ in Chicago) says MJ would have led the league in scoring if this never happened. And the team was abysmal; they were the worst team the season before and had like a 6-16 record without him that first season. But he improved as the season went along. At age 39, he was averaging 26-6-6 on 46% from the field in the final 17 games before his knee injury in that first season with the Wizards; only sixth year, 23 year old Kobe Byrant was putting up those type of numbers.</p>

<p>There was this game against the Raptors where Vince Carter dominated and scored like 24 in the first half. The second half&ndash;Wizards head coach Doug Collins gives Jordan the defensive assignment and Carter goes 0 for 7 in the second half.</p>

Also, people remember that he totally fucked up his finger on his right hand in a cigar cutting accident.</p>

      <label for="lin694d" class="commentText"><p>The sequence actually goes back a bit further. I think MJ actually scored the last seven points for the Bulls. But regarding the two buckets in this clip, the first one was right off the inbounds and MJ didn’t even give the Jazz time to double. He went straight to the bucket. Then on the steal and game winner, same thing…no timeout and Jazz didn’t have a plan on what to do or who to double MJ with. And that let MJ go one on one for the win.</p>

<p>There’s so much involved in this. Not just MJ’s clutchness with scoring but his BBIQ as well. He knew what he had to and executed perfectly on multiple plays in a row.</p>
