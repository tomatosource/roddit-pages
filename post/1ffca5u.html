</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Jokic is 29, turns 30 in February</p>

<p>Giannis is 29, turns 30 in December</p>

<p>Embiid is 30, turns 31 in March</p>

<p>Embiid obviously has an extensive injury history. Giannis is the one who relies the most on athleticism which can disappear quickly. Jokic seems like the one who will age the best.</p>

<p>How many more prime seasons do you guys think they have? Assuming no catastrophic injuries since that&rsquo;s not predictable</p>

      <label for="lmtkz9h" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m curious to see if Embiid&rsquo;s injury history helps lengthen his prime because he&rsquo;ll have fewer miles on (possibly) stronger legs.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see Giannis develop a late career jumper a la Kidd but that will be after his prime.</p>

      <label for="lmtm35p" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s actually a good point I didn&rsquo;t think of that. I just searched their total minutes played</p>

<p>Giannis: 28,797</p>

<p>Jokic: 24,105</p>

<p>Embiid: 15,917</p>

<p>So Embiid definitely has way less mileage on his legs. But he&rsquo;s also the oldest and most injury prone so I still think he probably has the shortest prime remaining but its an interesting aspect of this</p>

<p>He’s turning 30 this season but I think he definitely has a shot at 30k points. Which would mean he could have career totals of 30k points, 12k rebounds, 6k assists and 1500 steals and blocks each without much problem. That would be incredible</p>

      <label for="lmtmbx4" class="commentText"><p>I’d be shocked to see giannis develop a reliable 3 point shot. Kidd was an 80% free throw shooter while Gianni’s is 70%. His 3 point percentage has also gone down every year since 2020 and then it was 30%. He’s never shot over 30% from 3 for a year and that’s on entirely great looks considering other teams want him shooting 3s. Kidd had some rough seasons shooting from 3 but had many good ones too. Dude was 37% from 3 in his third season</p>

      <label for="lmtqk3h" class="commentText"><p>I’m very worried Embiid is past his prime.</p>

<p>Giannis will be determined by his desire to win.</p>

<p>Jokic could operate at this level for at least another 5-6 years. But again, his desire will determine output.</p>

<p>Giannis and Jokic have rings. Unless they want more I’d not be shocked to see a decline in certain areas soon. Within the next 2 years.</p>

<p>Embiid is probably out of the league by 35,36 and Giannis and Jokic will still be all stars if they want, and are major injury free.</p>

<p>Embiid is made out of glass so i don&rsquo;t see him playing much longer at a high level tbh.</p>

<p>Joker probably retires after this current contract to go ride horses.</p>

      <label for="lmtw5ja" class="commentText"><p>Jokic: it’s hard to say how interested he’s going to be in remaining an elite player in 3-5 years. I can’t totally tell if his aloofness is an act or genuine. Does he retire in 3 years? Are the Nuggets just really bad in 3 years (very possible) and he says I’m good, don’t need to grind on a 38 win team. He does have the game to be a top 10 player 8 years from now. It’s just if he wants it</p>

<p>Embid: I would be surprised if he’s still a top 10 player 3 years from now. He’s 7’1 280+ lbs with a long list of injuries. History tells us these type of players fall off a cliff real fast. I wouldn’t be shocked if he’s out of the league within 3 years due to his body breaking down</p>

<p>Giannis: this one is the most interesting to me. I’m super bearish on the future of the Bucks. That team’s future looks real dim and I suspect Giannis is going to leave even if he’d prefer to stay say. What does he look like on another team in 3-4 years. Does his athleticism begin to falter and how fast, does he ever develop a jump shot.</p>

<p>When Giannis&rsquo; athleticism leaves him he will fall off a cliff unless he completely changes his game. He&rsquo;ll still be a great defender but he needs to develop a shot. Running and jumping won&rsquo;t cut it in 3 years.</p>

<p>Jokic will age the best and has plenty more years in the tank.</p>

      <label for="lmtrmxv" class="commentText"><p>Giannis feels like in my opinion the only one with the hunger to keep playing for a long time, altough his athleticism will probably drop down shortly making his prime a lot shorter. Feels like Jokic does not have an interest in playing until he is 35+ and Embiid is a walking injury.</p>

<p>After that I’d say a toss up between Jokic and Giannis, I’d bet Embiid retires by the 29 or 30 season.</p>

      <label for="lmtuq5x" class="commentText"><p>You said he was past his prime because of injuries when he just had his best season.</p>

<p>This isn’t like Embiid where his injuries are pretty severe. One was landing on Bams foot, one was going for a block and landed awkwardly, one was someone sliding under him to take a charge and last year was a calf injury.</p>

<p>It’s not anything (aside from 21) to do with tearing stuff in his knees that’ll eventually catch up to him.</p>

      <label for="lmtwt45" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go there for Giannis yet (I don&rsquo;t think I would for Embiid either but this latest season was concerning with how much he missed). With a caveat that the fact he got hurt for two playoffs is dangerously close to a pattern. It is easy to say &ldquo;freak incidents&rdquo; but every injury makes future injuries easier to occur as you get older. I hope he has a healthy season and playoffs.</p>
