</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Jokic is 29, turns 30 in February</p>

<p>Giannis is 29, turns 30 in December</p>

<p>Embiid is 30, turns 31 in March</p>

<p>Embiid obviously has an extensive injury history. Giannis is the one who relies the most on athleticism which can disappear quickly. Jokic seems like the one who will age the best.</p>

<p>How many more prime seasons do you guys think they have? Assuming no catastrophic injuries since that&rsquo;s not predictable</p>

      <label for="lmw8c8o" class="commentText"><p>Ehh, you are factually correct, but he was the absolutely vital piece to that championship, and he finished it off with a legendary and historically significant closeout performance. He got healthy enough to finish the job, so I don&rsquo;t get why we should knock him for fighting through the injuries. You can miss a few games when you come through the way Giannis did at the end.</p>

      <label for="lmviqe9" class="commentText"><p>Why? Like I&rsquo;m actually asking apart from his size why do people think Giannis should play center.  He&rsquo;s never been a back to the basket player, his offense almost exclusively starts with face ups from the perimeter then driving in.  He plays like a wing and always has, even on defense he rarely guards opposing centers, he plays weak side help defense&hellip; Like a wing.  It&rsquo;s always non bucks fans or people who don&rsquo;t watch Giannis that just look at the 7 footer title that say he should play center.  But he&rsquo;s not a center, he&rsquo;s a 7 foot tall wing.  He&rsquo;d have to completely change his playstyle.</p>

<p>I could see it being something he does at the end of his career or if an injury saps his athleticism, after he can&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> great as a 7ft wing anymore.</p>

<p>He is the only top offensive option that has the largest defensive role in his team.  Hopefully he can reduce his offensive load, get some luck with the injuries and have a few years of consistiency.</p>

      <label for="lmx9icc" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also a little different for Embiid because, in terms of actual play, each season seems to be better than the last. So by that standard we don&rsquo;t even know if he&rsquo;s <em>hit</em> his prime yet.</p>

<p>But on the other hand injuries have prevented him from having more than like 3 or 4 full seasons (80%+ of games played). Albeit only like 1 fully healthy playoff run. So by that metric can you even consider it a prime if he&rsquo;s never healthy for the playoffs? Sorta confusing with him</p>

<p>I guess the question then becomes not when will his prime end but rather when will the injuries become so rampant that he will play less than 50% of the entire season pretty much no matter what. Including playoffs he&rsquo;s played more than half the season the last few seasons, but the trend as of now seems to be less and less games each year.</p>

      <label for="lmxmrat" class="commentText"><p>Yeah Embiid actually keeps getting better it seems. I think by the numbers last season will be seen as his peak though, and understandably. Best season in history in per-possession scoring on insane efficiency, great defense, and picked up 6apg as a C while he was at it. Injuries unfortunately cut him short, but it was a regular season legitimately as good as any in history</p>

<p>Now with PG and Maxey continuing to grow, I expect the sheer volume of his numbers to step back which hopefully saves him for the playoffs better. I’d rather see Joel cut all the way down to ~25ppg next year and end up with a line like 25/12/8. Maybe he plays slightly more defense, and in general would just be way more rested come playoffs. Let Maxey push towards 30 to spur more growth, and let PG do his usual numbers.</p>

<p>Yea Lebron, along with KD and Curry, are fooling a generation of fans into believing its &lsquo; normal&rsquo; for NBA primes to last thru your mid-to-late 30&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="lmvw7gr" class="commentText"><p>Nah, you must doesn&rsquo;t follow the NBA, there are several players that had an overstretched career now. CP3 was still an all star at 36, Jimmy Butler is still in his prime at 34, Dame is still an All-Star and 24ppg dude at 33 as well as PG, and  there there are/were several dudes that even if they were not star they hang around longer than usual (the likes of PJ Tucker, Al Horford, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Jeff Green)&hellip; so it is not unthinkable that absolute stars like Jokic or Giannis or Embiid, could &ldquo;easily&rdquo; go in their prime for 5 or 6 more years!</p>

<p>Also considering Lebron, Curry and KD you can clearly say they are not in the prime and they slided from it a good amount, they were just so ahead that they are still damn great players! Same will apply to others, and also injuries will no more be a major obstacle for the right type of players (just look at injury history of Steph and KD).</p>

      <label for="lmy4rmf" class="commentText"><p>No one can predict. The types of players that don’t rely on athleticism often last longer, but their margin for error with athleticism is pretty small and you still need to be pretty athletic to be great in the nba lol. And even the less athletic stars usually have great burst or quickness, one injury can sometimes take that away and while all their skill might still be there they lose certain moves that made it so difficult to defend them and defenses can just play them differently because they know they won’t get burned another way.</p>

<p>Eg melo losing his blow by threat in the triple threat after his knee injury, he could still shoot, but defenses knew his only real option was shooting so they could play him much tighter where in his prime he would have just blown by to the rim if they did that.</p>

<p>Harden is also an obvious example, he lost his burst after the hamstring and went from winning the scoring title three years straight and being the best iso scorer ever to being a solid <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> second option facilitator. Although his burst has gotten noticeably better every season since the hamstring.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll have another 3 seasons or so still scoring and rebounding well, but I would expect his defense to start suffering now.  He needs to get a lot leaner and let his co stars take more of the offensive burden if he wants to keep mattering much longer.</p>

<p>Giannis&hellip;. another 2 years of true prime before things start winding down.  Probably so slowly that we start talking about 2nd and 3rd primes.</p>

<p>Jokic will retire to his horses before anybody but him thinks he&rsquo;s left his prime.  5 years ish I suspect.  But if he wants to keep going, his old man game is going to be absurd.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s literally played a handful of games since returning from his meniscus injury. He has in no way been close to game shape since last January, when he was averaging 36/11/6</p>

<p>He hasn&rsquo;t returned from injury long enough for you to make such a statement</p>

He got asked kinda recently if he’s thought about how long he’ll play and he said as long as he’s still able to play at the highest level. I think that kinda means he won’t do something like that.

      <label for="lmwpyfv" class="commentText"><p>Prior to this summer, I had Jokic pegged as the guy who was gonna walk away while still in his prime, like Barry Sanders or MJ (first time). Because, horses.</p>

<p>But after the Serbian Summer, I’m now leaning towards Jokic playing into his mid-40s. For Serbia. How long he stays in the NBA is, I would guess, dependent on how long the Nuggets are competitive. Barring injury, he could be a very long way from retirement.</p>

<p>And as the first post in this thread says, Old Jokic is gonna be so much fun to watch. Athleticism is overrated, Court vision is underrated.</p>

With Embiid, he really has to stop going down. It will save him. As for Giannis, he&rsquo;s gotta lock down a consistent shot that isn&rsquo;t 3 feet from the cup. Jokic is gonna be doing the same shit for the next 5 years easy. And if Murray can return to a somewhat &ldquo;decent&rdquo; sidekick, they are easily a championship threat.</p>

      <label for="lmtw5ja" class="commentText"><p>Jokic: it’s hard to say how interested he’s going to be in remaining an elite player in 3-5 years. I can’t totally tell if his aloofness is an act or genuine. Does he retire in 3 years? Are the Nuggets just really bad in 3 years (very possible) and he says I’m good, don’t need to grind on a 38 win team. He does have the game to be a top 10 player 8 years from now. It’s just if he wants it</p>

<p>Embid: I would be surprised if he’s still a top 10 player 3 years from now. He’s 7’1 280+ lbs with a long list of injuries. History tells us these type of players fall off a cliff real fast. I wouldn’t be shocked if he’s out of the league within 3 years due to his body breaking down</p>

<p>Giannis: this one is the most interesting to me. I’m super bearish on the future of the Bucks. That team’s future looks real dim and I suspect Giannis is going to leave even if he’d prefer to stay say. What does he look like on another team in 3-4 years. Does his athleticism begin to falter and how fast, does he ever develop a jump shot.</p>

Dude is famous for working very hard after hours and installing a lot of regimes that stroke his teammated with how insanely disciplined he is to be the best he can at basketball. He influenced whole Denver to a new standard of form preparation. There is nothing reality-based in people saying he doesn&rsquo;t care about playing. We&rsquo;ve seen some players that showed how it looks and the results on the court were obvious too, Jokić is very visibly the opposite of it lol.</p>

<p>Jokić literally said during the MVP conference that he is planning to play in NBA as long as he is a plus for the team and will only retire when he&rsquo;s &ldquo;putting the franchise down&rdquo;. The &ldquo;aloofness&rdquo; is purely just what people think is fun and they say that without a reason.</p>

<p>Giannis will be determined by his desire to win.</p>

<p>Jokic could operate at this level for at least another 5-6 years. But again, his desire will determine output.</p>

<p>Giannis and Jokic have rings. Unless they want more I’d not be shocked to see a decline in certain areas soon. Within the next 2 years.</p>

<p>Embiid is probably out of the league by 35,36 and Giannis and Jokic will still be all stars if they want, and are major injury free.</p>

      <label for="lmtyen8" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but doesnt mean he cant. He plays a ton just off ball and uses his weight to bully guys (and strength really isnt something you lose even in your late 30s if you still workout in the gym consistently).</p>

<p>A lot of bigs that decline badly do so because they lose their atleticism and cant defend anymore, but since that isnt a main component of his game his decline will probably be very gradual. Though he will probably retire long before he actually becomes unplayable, so we might never know.</p>

<p>Realisticly Giannis is gonna decline with his athleticism and at that point he really aint gonna be able to play like he has. Hed need a major change innhis game to still remain who he is and injuries and slowly becoming more of a thing with him. Its not about weather he can keep up on offense, but on defense thats the issue here.</p>

<p>Embid though could actually age better than people thing given his development as a shooter and whatnot. However its his injuries that make him questionable and him playing in a lesser role hasnt exactly shown the best results.</p>

He’s never shot over 30% from 3 for a year and that’s on entirely great looks considering other teams want him shooting 3s. Kidd had some rough seasons shooting from 3 but had many good ones too.

<p>Giannis: 28,797</p>

<p>Jokic: 24,105</p>

<p>Embiid: 15,917</p>

<p>So Embiid definitely has way less mileage on his legs. But he&rsquo;s also the oldest and most injury prone so I still think he probably has the shortest prime remaining but its an interesting aspect of this</p>

      <label for="lmtvowj" class="commentText"><p>Giannis has had a deceptively long career thus far, and yet just had his best offensive season arguably, 30 points per game on 65% true shooting.</p>

<p>He’s turning 30 this season but I think he definitely has a shot at 30k points. Which would mean he could have career totals of 30k points, 12k rebounds, 6k assists and 1500 steals and blocks each without much problem. That would be incredible</p>

<p>Embiid is made out of glass so i don&rsquo;t see him playing much longer at a high level tbh.</p>

<p>Joker probably retires after this current contract to go ride horses.</p>

<p>When Giannis&rsquo; athleticism leaves him he will fall off a cliff unless he completely changes his game. He&rsquo;ll still be a great defender but he needs to develop a shot. Running and jumping won&rsquo;t cut it in 3 years.</p>

<p>Jokic will age the best and has plenty more years in the tank.</p>

If they’re able to extend their primes like Curry and KD, there will be a new era of what longevity looks like. Otherwise it makes them, and LeBron to an nth degree look even better by comparison. To have very good longevity after your peers is one thing. To have better longevity than those who came after you (with improved science, tech, and medicine) is even more impressive.</p>

At worst Embiid can take up a brook Lopez role for years to come, even when he&rsquo;s no longer in his MVP-level years, he doesn&rsquo;t need his athleticism to be a great role player with his elite shooting. I feel like Giannis will have a harder time being an effective role player without a jump shot if he loses his athleticism. Jokic will probably last the longest of all 3 assuming he doesn&rsquo;t retire to be with his horses.</p>

      <label for="lmucrni" class="commentText"><p>this notion that because someone is an athlete they are more prone to a faster decline doesnt make sense.  unless you are a stationary jump shooter, and even then when those guys loose they legs they cant shoot, everyone relies on speed strength athleticism etc. everyone body is different and some sustain better then others. many athletes gain a shot to compensate. if your a shooter and its disappearing you cant gain speed. harden had a quick first step but he wasn’t an athlete and relied on his athleticism less then most. one ripped hammy and look how much it hurt his game. giannis maybe rip his hammy 20 times and still be ok.. joker could lose a step and become worthless. bron seems ok and he was a mega athlete. there is no blueprint on this kind of stuff like ppl make it seem. vc long career. rashard lewis shooter but short prime. shaq short prime, mutombo long. like there its all over the place. nash short prime. i feel like most will pick joker but i think any loss in movement will put him a little too far behind as he already lacks in that department. think giannis will have the longest since he looks built to last</p>

      <label for="lmwgdo5" class="commentText"><p>Giannis will last a lot longer than we think. Out of all the attributes in basketball, height and length ages the best. Giannis is one of the longest players in basketball, and even if he loses say, 20% of his speed, he&rsquo;s still as fast as an average wing. With his strength (which also ages well), he&rsquo;ll always be an all-time finisher, and with him clearly being a positive passer and defender, it&rsquo;s unlikely he&rsquo;ll lose superstar status within 3-4 seasons.</p>

<p>However, the Bucks are a different story. Brook Lopez has become one of the slowest players in the league and he&rsquo;s on the wrong side of 30. This might be the last year of him as a legit starter.</p>

<p>Khris Middleton has aged out of being a positive defender, and his athleticism, which was never good in the first place, has become severely below-average. He&rsquo;ll remain a positive shooter, shot-maker and passer, but his driving will be nearly non-existent, and he&rsquo;ll be barely a starter in a season or two.</p>

<p>Damian Lillard is a 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; guard who&rsquo;s also not on the good side of 30. He has never been a good defender &ndash; and he&rsquo;s bordering on being one of the league&rsquo;s worst. Not only do small guards typically age terribly, he&rsquo;s a small guard with some injury history who you would never see in a Top-10 passing list. He&rsquo;ll always be one of the best shooters and iso scorers in the league, but that&rsquo;s about it. This might be his last true all-star level season.</p>

<p>The Bucks lack cap space (Dame&rsquo;s contract is MASSIVE up until 2027) and FRPs. They have almost no youth. They have no depth that&rsquo;s locked into multi-year contracts. Bobby Portis has a contract year coming up. Their future looks bad.</p>

      <label for="lmtzx9d" class="commentText"><p>I think we could see a sizeable decline in Embiiid&rsquo;s production as soon as next season. The injuries arent slowing down for him and hes only gettin older. But he&rsquo;s still 7&rsquo;0 and very skilled and doesnt totally rely on athleticism, so he could still be effective for a while. Just not the 34/11/5 MVP caliber player he is now.</p>

<p>Giannis&rsquo;s prime will be determined by if he gets a consistent shot. If he could shoot like KD he could play til 40. But he relies the most on athleticism and has also had his fair share of injuries. Also the team has to be built in a certain way for Giannis to succeed. Bucks are getting old and team construction could make Giannis&rsquo;s prime shorter.</p>

<p>Jokic prime is soley based on desire. I could see Jokic retiring abruptly in his prime, and we wouldnt find out until after his last game.</p>

      <label for="lmvegab" class="commentText"><p>I think Embiid will be done in 2-3 more years. He’s glass, and will certainly suffer another major knee injury.</p>

<p>Jokic in 3-4. He doesn’t rely on athleticism, but as the little athleticism he does have starts to leave him I think the impact it has on his performance will be tremendous.</p>

<p>I think Giannis has 7-8 more years left in him. When they get the last drop of juice out of brolo I think Giannis will slide to center and be FANTASTIC there for a few years.</p>

<p>With Giannis I think he’s a case where he has so much surplus athleticism that even when he’s past his physical peak he would still be considered a freak at center.</p>

<p>It’s kind of similar to dwight Howard when he was a laker (2nd stint) imo. Dwight as a laker (2nd stint) was still a truly elite athlete at the position despite being clearing washed when compared to his prime. Per 36 he averaged like <sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> and 1.5 blocks or something crazy like that.</p>

I think Giannis is hard to say because he relies on his athletism so much. But he is the freak. I think 4 more top tier in the NBA seasons then I could see him bulking up and being more of a big. He could still be really good on defense for another 7 years. And I Think Jokic will age gracefully. I see him having a Jason kidd type ending to his career. Maybe not a elite player but smart and helps his teammates get better. I&rsquo;m going to say 6 more high level years and 3 solid role player years</p>

      <label for="lmvp705" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s so hard to tell. Giannis isn&rsquo;t a high IQ player with a wide breadth of tricks in his bag like LeBron, so as his athleticism wanes, so to will his efficiency.</p>

<p>The pairing with Dame is going to kill his career. They need to move on from that and fast. And move on from Doc.</p>

<p>Jokic? It&rsquo;s not going to be a super long career. As much as his conditions seems fine on paper, the eye test suggests otherwise. But I hope I&rsquo;m wrong. Sabonis Sr. played late into his career and was a hefty dude. Jokic could do the same.</p>

<p>Joel &lsquo;Knees-o-Glass&rsquo; Embiid? Yeah. I won&rsquo;t even take bets on this season.</p>

<p>Jokic will be good for another 4-5 seasons. Nuggs will need to do something about their roster tho.</p>

<p>Embiid needs to become like an aging Tim Duncan, but he&rsquo;ll never do it. He&rsquo;ll likely be more like Barkley ended. Hobbling around.</p>

      <label for="lmx2ipz" class="commentText"><p>Tbh I think Giannis already peaked. He has one consistent scoring move, which causes the bucks problems in the playoffs every year unless everyone else is injured. And neither giannis or the bucks seem to have any interest in developing his game further. He’ll still be top 5 mvp for a few years but I think he’s already gotten as good as he’s gonna get.</p>

<p>Embiid I would say like 2-3 probably, but he will still have injury problems. He got so much better just last year and was the easy mvp pick…but then got hurt.</p>

<p>Jokic I think will surprise people, I think his game will age really well, so maybe like 5 more seasons. It will depend on his team though, if the nuggets give him a bunch of shit team mates I could honestly see him phoning it in or being like f this and retiring.</p>

      <label for="lmy3cy7" class="commentText"><p>Idk I think jokic and Giannis have a much longer time if you really think about it lebron Kd and steph might not be there athletically they’ve had to change their game but there arguably still 90-95% of what they were in their primes. 35 is the new 30 lol shoot they might be able to play to 40.</p>

<p>Jokic doesn’t have a game that’s too predicated on athleticism in the first place. Honestly it’s really if he even wants to keep playing or retire. I can see him being in his prime for another 5-6 years.</p>

<p>Giannis is still in solid shape but the lack of shooting might start to affect his game but with tech and the way he takes care of his body probably another 5-6 years too.</p>

<p>Embiid is the person I’m most worried about just due to his sheer size and the toll his knees have taken but he could be one bad injury away but probably like 3-4 years before we start seeing a consistent decline</p>

Embiid and Jokic can still rebound and rim protect even if they lose speed, but Giannis is pretty useless without his athleticism. That said, I see Giannis being healthy and athletic much longer than the other two.</p>
