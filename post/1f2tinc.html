      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f2tinc/now_that_time_has_passed_what_are_your_thoughts/"><p>Now that time has passed, what are your thoughts on the addition of DeMar DeRozan for the Sacramento Kings?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Time has passed, and training camps are due to open in about ~5 weeks. The season is approaching. Good time now to really analyze where teams are going into the season and different offseason moves.</p>

<p>DeMar DeRozan was on the market for a while, but ended up getting paid&mdash;3 years, roughly $74M, in a three team deal that sent Harrison Barnes to San Antonio and Chris Duarte to Chicago.</p>

<p>The Kings offense suffered the second half of the season with injuries to Fox, Huerter, Monk&hellip;they defeated the Warriors in their first play-in game as the 9th seed but went down quite meekly to the Pelicans in their second play-in game. The Kings had been looking to make an impact move for a while and were able to land DeRozan, without giving up significant future core pieces. They gave up a &lsquo;31 unprotected pick swap to the Spurs but that is something we won&rsquo;t know the value of for years down the line.</p>

<p>The injuries exposed some holes in their offensive attack last season. The Kings lacked another three level scorer outside of Fox and shot creation in general. Now enter DeRozan, who remains an elite midrange shotmaker and has become a good playmaker as well.</p>

<p>Some people have their questions about fit with their two stars in Fox and Sabonis. The Kings knew they needed to add talent to keep up in the tough West. Do you think DeMar was the right move to make and how much do you think he moves the needle for them? How good do you all think the fit is on this team? Do you expect DeMar to maintain his level of play as he hits his mid-30s?</p>

      <label for="lk8wu3c" class="commentText"><p>I think he&rsquo;ll look pretty damn good there.  I suspect post all star break people might be saying Wow, DeRozan defense might be underrated.  I think he&rsquo;s smart enough to combine well with their other guards offensively, he won&rsquo;t be a black hole.  Maybe even a career high assist % in store.  I think it&rsquo;s totally possible he shows up in playoff moments for them as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you could ever predict home court advantage for Sacramento (or nearly any west team) but I think this season could be a pretty decent surprise for them.  Above the play in at least to begin playoffs I&rsquo;d wager.</p>

      <label for="lk8ynje" class="commentText"><p>In theory, he could be the Al Horford to the Kings in terms of experience and leadership. The issue is the things that let a player quietly age like defense and shooting were never DeRozan&rsquo;s strong points.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really like late stage DeRozan if the team is looking to win a championship, but if the team wants to make the playoffs the next few years and get this franchise something to get excited about, he could do that.</p>

      <label for="lk9084k" class="commentText"><p>derozan is such a unique player and i do think there&rsquo;s going to be an adjustment period for both him and the rest of the team. wouldn&rsquo;t shock me if the kings stumble a bit out of the gate (first 20 games or so) before finally figuring it out around Christmas and looking like a potential playoff team.</p>

<p>i think they&rsquo;re in the same tier of teams that they were last year, competing for a 5-10 spot, but derozan definitely improves the team. unfortunately, neither him nor sabonis have particularly inspiring playoff careers, so i still think their ceiling is a first round exit.</p>
