</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We&rsquo;ve been running this <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/04/09/why-are-discounters-like-99-cents-only-stores-in-dire-straits/" target="_blank">&ldquo;99 Cent Store&rdquo;</a> free agent column since back in 2018. No NBA player is actually &ldquo;99 Cents,&rdquo; of course, but the goal here is to identify some potentially undervalued players based on their perceived market. We&rsquo;ve had some success in the past, including players like Fred VanVleet and Isaiah Hartenstein who both got listed as &ldquo;featured items&rdquo; before they had become NBA starters.</p>

<p>Normally, we do an entry on each position, with different tiers of estimated contracts. However, this offseason is shortened so we&rsquo;re going to abbreviate the column and highlight one player at each position instead.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>PG Monte Morris, Minnesota Timberwolves, UFA, 29 years old</strong></p>

<p>We have no shortage of &ldquo;99 Cent Store&rdquo; alumni who could be making a return appearance, including the heady Tyus Jones and the lengthy Delon Wright.</p>

<p>But given the current market, Monte Morris may be the most distressed asset among them. Traditionally known as a high-end backup, he started 74 games for Denver in 2021-22 (due to Jamal Murray&rsquo;s injury) and then 61 games for Washington in 2022-23. Unfortunately his career hit a skid this past season. A quad injury cost him a few months and he never found his footing in the rotation with either Detroit or Minnesota after that. He only averaged 14.4 minutes per game all old and felt like he was cast into irrelevance.</p>

<p>Of course, that could make him a great &ldquo;buy low&rdquo; candidate now. If Morris (still only 29 years old) can get back up to 100%, he should retain his value as one of the better backup point guards in the league. He&rsquo;s a competent scorer (14.6 points per 36, 39.1% shooting from 3), but his best virtue is his steadiness with the ball in his hands. For his career, he&rsquo;s averaged 5.6 assists against only 1.1 turnovers per 36. That ratio (5.04) is actually better than some all-time greats like Chris Paul (4.01) or John Stockton (3.72).</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Morris, being a traditional steady &ldquo;field general&rdquo; point guard isn&rsquo;t en vogue right now. GMs want guards with more size, strength, and length to be switchable defenders. But still, Morris can certainly help teams who want a steadying presence for their second units.</p>

<p><em>best fit</em>: Minnesota&rsquo;s backcourt is crowded (and just got more crowded with Rob Dillingham), so Monte Morris should look for opportunities for more minutes elsewhere. The most obvious one would be a return to Denver, where he&rsquo;d represent an upgrade on recently departed Reggie Jackson. The Nuggets don&rsquo;t have cap room, but it may be worth it for Morris to take a cheap deal and rehab his value on a big stage.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>SG De&rsquo;Anthony Melton, Philadelphia 76ers, UFA, 26 years old</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of chatter about how the Philadelphia 76ers may be able to use their cap space to upgrade the wing spots around Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid. In the process of that, I wonder if current Sixer De&rsquo;Anthony Melton may be overlooked.</p>

<p>While he&rsquo;s only 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, Melton&rsquo;s wingspan (6&rsquo;8&rdquo;) allows him to play as an effective 3+D wing. He&rsquo;s shot 36.9% from deep in his career &ndash; and boosted that up to 38.3% over the last four seasons combined. Defensively, he&rsquo;s averaged 2.2 steals and 0.8 blocks per 36 and has always charted as a positive in BPM (+1.6 per 100 possessions on that end). It&rsquo;s no wonder why stats nerds like John Hollinger have him ranked highly on their big boards of free agents.</p>

<p>If Melton had a bigger name or a better pedigree, he&rsquo;d be cashing in a big contract this summer. Instead, he may be undervalued. No one&rsquo;s expected a bargain bin contract here (he&rsquo;d be our most expensive item in the store), but he could still represent a value on any contract that&rsquo;s below $12M a year.</p>

<p><em>best fit</em>: A return to Philadelphia makes the most sense given their abundance of cap space. But in a perfect (and uncapped world), De&rsquo;Anthony Melton would be great for a veteran team like Milwaukee that wants to upgrade their SG spot.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>SF Naji Marshall, New Orleans Pelicans, UFA, 26 years old</strong></p>

<p>Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram (and now Dejounte Murray!) are the headline attractions in New Orleans, but one of the most impressive ingredients in the gumbo are the Pelicans&rsquo; abundance of 3+D wings. Not only do they have Herbert Jones and Trey Murphy III, but they have Naji Marshall peeking out from behind them.</p>

<p>To be fair, Marshall is more of a D-than-3 wing. He has good size at 6&rsquo;7&rdquo; 220 and uses it to grab 6.5 rebounds and 1.3 steals per 36. He&rsquo;s versatile enough to play any wing spot. The &ldquo;swing&rdquo; skill for Marshall is the shooting. He&rsquo;s only hit 31.3% of his threes for his career (and only 28.9% in college). There are some reasons for optimism there though, as he boosted his numbers up to 38.7% from three and 79.1% from the free throw line. If he can maintain that, he&rsquo;d have a lot of value on a roster.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always risky to bet on a player after one outlier shooting season (with a small sample size). Some of us talked ourselves into Keita Bates-Diop last year and his percentages fell back to earth. The most realistic scenario is that Marshall regresses back to being a below-average shooter again. But even still, if you&rsquo;re betting on him being a minutes filler defender with <em>some</em> shooting upside, then he may be worth adding to a rotation.</p>

<p><em>best fit</em>: If he doesn&rsquo;t return to New Orleans, it&rsquo;d be nice to see Naji Marshall land in a situation where he&rsquo;d get heavier minutes and extended opportunity to turn into that reliable 3+D player we want. Charlotte feels like one of those to me. Since their young stars LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller are both shooters, they have a little more leeway than other teams in terms of erring on the side of defense.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>PF Jalen Smith, Indiana Pacers, UFA, 24 years old</strong></p>

<p>If you could take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXYlv-z_xHQ" target="_blank">glasses off</a> Jalen Smith, then he&rsquo;d look the part of a valuable NBA player. He&rsquo;s a 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; power forward with legitimate shooting potential. He demonstrated that last season, hitting 42.4% from deep. You can see why he was a top high school recruit and a recent lottery pick.</p>

<p>Still, there&rsquo;s something about him that NBA teams clearly do not like. The Phoenix Suns took him at # 10, and them promptly dumped him to Indiana the following season. Indiana talked him up as a big part of their future, but then made every type of move they could make to avoid that (drafting Jarace Walker, trading for Obi Toppin and Pascal Siakam, etc.)</p>

<p>The biggest problem with Jalen Smith &ndash; aka &ldquo;Stix&rdquo; &ndash; is that he&rsquo;s stiff in his hips and struggles defensively. At this point, it may be time to give up on him as a potential starter for that reason. But again, we&rsquo;re not shopping on Fifth Avenue here. We&rsquo;re looking for bargains. And given Smith&rsquo;s reputation around the league at this point, he could justify that as a flier depending on the team.</p>

<p><em>best fit</em>: The theoretical version of Jalen Smith as a stretch big would fit well on a team like Oklahoma City, but the bar to get minutes is high there. A more realistic outcome would be going to a rebuilding franchise like Utah (if they trade Lauri Markkanen). Danny Ainge could try to rehab Jalen Smith&rsquo;s value, either for their own team or as a modest trade asset.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>C Daniel Theis, Los Angeles Clippers, UFA, 32 years old</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been an up-and-down career for the German Daniel Theis, who has been on 5 teams over the last 4 seasons alone. In fact, it looked like it may be the <em>end</em> of his career recently, as he got waived by the Indiana Pacers in November. In some ways, he was lucky to latch on to the Clippers&rsquo; roster after some injuries hit.</p>

<p>Theis made the most of that opportunity. He played in 59 games, averaging 17.1 minutes, which is no great shakes but more than expected. He also played better than expected as well. Theis looked like less like the washed-out bench player that we thought and more like the Theis that we saw in the FIBA World Cup. At 6&rsquo;8&rdquo;, he&rsquo;s an active smallball big who can play some PF and some center and hit a three. There&rsquo;s value to that, especially on a team like the Clippers with naturally bigger wings around him.</p>

<p><em>best fit</em>: The Clippers may have to decide about whether to keep Mason Plumlee or Daniel Theis as their backup big. If Theis leaves, I could see him fitting on a team like New Orleans. The Pelicans just lost Larry Nance Jr. who played pretty well as a smallball big for them. As mentioned with Jalen Smith, OKC could be another team looking for a cheap big to play 5-out.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>more names to consider</strong>: If you&rsquo;re looking for a defensive guard, Delon Wright (MIA) and Kris Dunn (UTA) are two of the best in the business. Dalano Banton (POR) would have fit that same bill if the team hadn&rsquo;t re-signed him. As far as bigs go, Luke Kornet (BOS) and Drew Eubanks (PHX) may be the cheapest ones who could fill minutes in a rotation. But if you&rsquo;re looking for true upside, no bargain bin free agent has more than wing Brandon Boston Jr. (LAC). Still 22 years old, he&rsquo;s worth a flier for young teams.</p>

      <label for="lav3aoq" class="commentText"><p>Curious to see what happens with him. Really liked him on the Sixers. He kinda fucked us in the playoffs last year against Boston. In games 4 through 7, he was <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> from the field and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> from 3. I remember when we got him that Memphis fans warned that he was a really solid regular season player who folded a bit in the playoffs. In game 6, I believe, he had a memorable stretch of play. He got three WIDE open looks on like back to back to back possessions and missed them all by a mile. Everyone else was shitting the bed too. But that sequence reeeeaaally hurt.</p>

<p>But I think the bigger question is his health. He had a lingering back injury in January (I think). He would come back, play for a few games, then miss a couple weeks, play again, miss more games. It did not seem good. Sucks. He seems like an awesome dude. And he was due for a payday. Hopefully the summer off will fix him up. But back injuries are kinda scary, especially for a guy seeking a new long term contract.</p>

He tried to return multiple times last season and re-aggravated his back after a game or two. He also dropped off pretty badly last playoffs, and that seems in line with what memphis fans said about him before he came to philly.</p>

<p>You need someone to guard bigger wings and someone to guard quick guards is my thinking. I feel like if Melton&rsquo;s market collapses he&rsquo;d be able to rehab his value starting next to LaMelo and then you have a potential trade asset. Everyone is looking for versatile defenders with long arms that can make a three.</p>

      <label for="lavd3kf" class="commentText"><p>always great content. i feel like when ive watched naji, hes has a really good feel for the game, solid handle and a surprising ability to find the right pass. he reminds me of fellow pel solomon hill, in his underrated aspects of his game. he could do well on a lot of teams if they bought into his skills outside his position. (pels fans feel free to correct me if im wrong)</p>

<p>i would love to see theis on the lakers. i think as a competent backup big who moved really well with the clippers, theis could plug and play for the lakers safely during non ad minutes. not sure what kind of lineups they could run, but i think he would fit well with christie and vando, and maybe hayes. and if you threw in a good passing guard, that could capitalize on theis’s above the rim game as a lob threat. i know they wont, but i wish they would try skylar mays at the pg. he played some excellent, steady, reliable and traditional pg minutes for portland last year, and looked really solid with the ball in his hands.</p>

      <label for="lavapru" class="commentText"><p>idk about contract and cap but Monte Morris would be solid on the Knicks because we essentially have zero ball handler / play maker / floor general type guy besides brunson and that would be huge in a reserve role</p>

<p>i love deuce ans wish he could be that guy be he seems to be more of a defensive menace and on O just really a scorer</p>

<p>idk how it could fit but would be awesome</p>
