      <label for="l6u2wzs" class="commentText"><p><strong>TRENTON, N.J.</strong> – New Jersey Nets star Jason Kidd filed for divorce from his wife of 10 years yesterday, accusing her of &ldquo;extreme cruelty” during their marriage.</p>

<p>In the dissolution papers, filed in state Superior Court, Kidd accuses Joumana Kidd of physically and mentally abusing him, threatening to make false domestic violence complaints against him to police, and of interfering with his relationship with his children.</p>

<p>“The defendant’s extreme and unwarranted jealousy and rage has left the plaintiff concerned about her emotional stability,” the papers say.</p>

<p>The divorce filing came less than a day after the 33-year-old filed a domestic violence complaint seeking a temporary restraining order against his wife.</p>

<p>“Jason Kidd filed for divorce from his wife today on the grounds of extreme cruelty over a long period of time,” Kidd’s attorney, Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich, said in a statement.</p>

<p>“I can’t talk about my personal stuff,” he said after the Nets beat the Raptors 101-86 last night.</p>

<p>“There is really no distraction,” Kidd added. “This is my job.’’</p>

<p>His complaint, however, paints a detailed portrait of Joumana Kidd as a vitriolic, jealous and paranoid wife prone to public outbursts and threats, including during a recent Nets game.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Joumana Kidd used the couple’s 8-year-old son on Dec.27 to sneak into the Nets locker room and rummage through Jason Kidd’s locker to find his cell phone. After looking up the names and numbers on it, the complaint said she left her son to take a front row seat, where she shouted insults at Kidd throughout the game.</p>

<p>The papers accuse Joumana Kidd of kicking, hitting, punching and throwing household objects at her husband as she became “increasingly controlling and manipulative” in the last few years of their union.</p>

<p>According to Kidd, his wife had tracking devices installed on his cars and computers and has harassed his trainer, friends and family. Jason Kidd was arrested in January 2001 after his wife told police he hit her during an argument. Kidd pleaded guilty to spousal abuse, was fined $200 (U.S.) and ordered to take anger management class.</p>

<p>2nd year: JV coach and assistants</p>

<p>3rd and 4th year: varsity coach and assistants</p>

<p>Outside factors: coaches retire, coaches quit, coaches transfer lots of different things could lead to 1 or 2 new faces year by year. Or you as a player transfer then you have an entire new program of coaches.</p>

      <label for="l6tpmmy" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m one of those people and I think a lot of that stems from exactly what Lively is saying here. There were multiple times per game in the regular season where something or someone was clearly not working and Kidd let it continue to give the payers experience when he could easily fix it.</p>

<p>For instance, not calling timeouts during a 0-20 run. Or using experimental defensive schemes for a 6 game road trip that led to one of the worst defenses ever. Or playing with 3 guard lineups and getting slaughtered. Or playing without a center when you have two starting level centers.</p>

<p>As an outside observer, this is infuriating to watch without knowing what the coach is testing or trying to do. But kudos to him, it&rsquo;s worked out in the playoffs and he&rsquo;s stopped doing all the things he did wrong intentionally in the regular season like running weird lineups or not calling time outs and he&rsquo;s had amazing schemes.</p>

Jason Kidd has shown be an exceptional playoffs coach and there has been growing pains in the regular season but that might due to the roster construction. The one that annoyed me the most was the Maxi Kleber one in game 4 against the clippers. Kleber was specifically put in to play 5 out to get the most out of the offence which he did but the trade of was a lack of paint protection but people couldn’t comprehend it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised how many Mavs fans wanted him gone though. 2 seasons ago he had you in that WCF in part due to his coaching adjustments allowing them to beat a 64 win team by stifling their offense after going down 2-0. Last year he didn&rsquo;t really get a fair shake because the Kyrie trade killed their wing and big depth.</p>

<p>Him keeping THJ in the rotation for as long as he did was some malpractice though lol.</p>

<p>Amazing people hit women</p>

<p><strong>TRENTON, N.J.</strong> – New Jersey Nets star Jason Kidd filed for divorce from his wife of 10 years yesterday, accusing her of &ldquo;extreme cruelty” during their marriage.</p>

<p>In the dissolution papers, filed in state Superior Court, Kidd accuses Joumana Kidd of physically and mentally abusing him, threatening to make false domestic violence complaints against him to police, and of interfering with his relationship with his children.</p>

<p>“The defendant’s extreme and unwarranted jealousy and rage has left the plaintiff concerned about her emotional stability,” the papers say.</p>

<p>The divorce filing came less than a day after the 33-year-old filed a domestic violence complaint seeking a temporary restraining order against his wife.</p>

<p>“Jason Kidd filed for divorce from his wife today on the grounds of extreme cruelty over a long period of time,” Kidd’s attorney, Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich, said in a statement.</p>

<p>“I can’t talk about my personal stuff,” he said after the Nets beat the Raptors 101-86 last night.</p>

<p>“There is really no distraction,” Kidd added. “This is my job.’’</p>

<p>His complaint, however, paints a detailed portrait of Joumana Kidd as a vitriolic, jealous and paranoid wife prone to public outbursts and threats, including during a recent Nets game.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Joumana Kidd used the couple’s 8-year-old son on Dec.27 to sneak into the Nets locker room and rummage through Jason Kidd’s locker to find his cell phone. After looking up the names and numbers on it, the complaint said she left her son to take a front row seat, where she shouted insults at Kidd throughout the game.</p>

<p>The papers accuse Joumana Kidd of kicking, hitting, punching and throwing household objects at her husband as she became “increasingly controlling and manipulative” in the last few years of their union.</p>

<p>According to Kidd, his wife had tracking devices installed on his cars and computers and has harassed his trainer, friends and family. Jason Kidd was arrested in January 2001 after his wife told police he hit her during an argument. Kidd pleaded guilty to spousal abuse, was fined $200 (U.S.) and ordered to take anger management class.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s a damn good coach in my opinion.</p>

      <label for="l6tmae5" class="commentText"><p>Sure but if you experiment with a bad roster people will call you shit when none of it works. Coaching in the NBA is a weird thing. I think some 90% of our discussion of coaching is just complete horseshit.</p>

Doesnt take a great coach to know maxi is not a 5 we saw that against the Clips when harden legit had a free lane to the rim cus he didnt want to play Lively/gaff for some reason. Kidd hasn&rsquo;t done that mainly cus maxi has been injured but dont rule out him doing something stupid like that.</p>

<p>“He’s been one of the best coaches I’ve ever had.

      <label for="l6tlirc" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s super weird that Kidd is shit on while Malone is praised on this sub. By far, Kidd has shown better adjustments, better usage of subs (giving Luka more rest), etc.</p>

<p>I feel like this sub and especially the Nuggets sub are brigaded by paid Malone supporters for whatever reason. Maybe Malone is that sensitive about his image online. He certainly has the resources to do it.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a big group of people simping for a coach through their own free will, especially one who is not even a top tier coach like Spo.</p>

      <label for="l6u0i8a" class="commentText"><p>To summarize: a very good playoff coach and a very, very annoying regular season coach. He fucks around in regular season, tries out all sorts of wacky rotations, is stubborn as a mule with some players, takes quite a while for him to give young guys minutes (or the random game like the one that Gafford played 7 minutes in the game after a monstrous performance) and will not use a timeout during an opponents run for the love of his life. Also, before the second half of the season, most of his buzzer plays was Luka and inshallah (even if we had iconic buzzer killers in the years prior with Dinwiddie and Maxi).</p>

<p>In the playoffs he is great at adjustments, runs very tight rotations, balances the rest of everyone else.</p>
