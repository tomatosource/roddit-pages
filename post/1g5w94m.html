<p>By Shirley Leung</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday weren’t in Celtics uniform Wednesday night, but they worked as teammates on something bigger than basketball: closing the racial wealth gap in Boston.</p>

<p>Brown and Holiday, joined by his wife Lauren Holiday, held court at Grace by Nia jazz club in the Seaport District, where they met the 10 Boston-area entrepreneurs who are part of an <a href="https://bxchange.org/apply/" target="_blank">accelerator program</a> Brown and the Holidays launched this month.</p>

<p>Each entrepreneur will receive up to $100,000 in grant funding over the next three years as well as access to mentors and services from partner institutions including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard Business School, and Roxbury Community College.</p>

<p>The accelerator is the first program to come out of Brown’s <a href="https://bxchange.org/" target="_blank">Boston XChange (BXC)</a>, a nonprofit initiative the Celtics star unveiled in August to help create <span class="math inline">\(5 billion in generational wealth in Boston’s communities of color. [BXC grew out of Brown’s comments last year](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/07/29/sports/sunday-basketball-notes/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) after inking a then-record \)</span>304 million NBA contract extension and how he wanted to use some of the money to create a “Black Wall Street” in Boston.</p>

<p>“Sports has its way of bringing everybody together, especially here in Boston,” Brown told the group. “We know you love your sports &hellip; but I think there’s championships to be won outside of the game of basketball as well.”</p>

<p>Brown partnered with the Holidays’ <a href="https://www.jlhfund.org/" target="_blank">JLH Social Impact Fund</a>, created in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd to support founders of color nationwide. To date, the fund has doled out about $5 million in grants to over 200 businesses and nonprofits.</p>

<p>“This is my favorite part, where we can come in and we can see people talking about their dreams,” said Jrue Holiday.</p>

<p>Lauren Holiday, who was a longtime member of the US Women’s National soccer team, said she wants to get to know the founders and be part of their journeys. “For us, it’s so much more than just writing a check,” she said. “It’s actually being involved.”</p>

<p>Renee King, program lead for the JLH fund who was part of the accelerator’s selection process, emphasized the importance of collaboration in tackling something as challenging as racial wealth disparities.</p>

<p>“It can’t be centered around one person, one platform, one thing,” she said. “It needs to be an entire village organized.”</p>

<p>While Boston is awash in accelerators and incubators, especially for tech and life science startups, there’s not much support for the creative economy. That’s what Brown and the Holidays decided to focus on — think design, entertainment, fashion, media, and culinary arts.</p>

<p>Applications were due in August, with the majority coming from Black founders and many from Dorchester, according to Yscaira Jimenez, a serial entrepreneur and MIT lecturer who helped design the accelerator and was part of the selection process.</p>

<p>“The most exciting kind of statistic is the diversity of the creator types,” Jimenez said. “We had&hellip; technology and retail &hellip; we had advocacy, visual arts. We had just people from all over — music, culinary.”</p>
