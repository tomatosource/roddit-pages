</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Initially I thought this was a bizarre trade and not a good one for the Timberwolves.  But there were 2 things I failed to realize:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Divincenzo is really good.  Maybe the best 3&amp;D in the league considering only Curry and Doncic made more 3s last season (Doncic only made 1 more three than Divincenzo while Divincenzo shot 40% and Doncic 38%).</p></li>

<li><p>Naz Reid is also really good and somewhat under the radar because I forgot about him when I first heard about this trade.  Last season he took a big step upward and shot 41% from three on 5 attempts per game, adding pseudo-elite three point shooting to a good, well-rounded game he already had.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So if the wolves move Randle for a draft pick, or if they figure out an effective way to integrate him, either way I think they did pretty good in this trade.</p>

<p>And the Knicks have a pretty obvious upside where KAT is somewhat significantly better than Randle in my opinion and he and Jalen Brunson might make a deadly PnR duo.</p>

<p>Edit: Ok, Randle is worth more than a draft pick.  My point was that he has trade value and the Wolves should be able to trade him if they don&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t integrate him.<br>
And perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have called Divincenzo one of the best 3&amp;D guys but rather one of the best at defense among the truly elite 3 point shooters.  (top 20 players in total 3pm last season only include 2 guys who are better at defense than DD)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Back in 2016 when he was Literally Hitler, James Harden didn&rsquo;t get selected for any All-NBA teams at all while playing 82 games.</p>

<p>2015: 27.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. 2nd in MVP voting, 1st All-NBA.</p>

<p>2016: <sup>29</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.5. Just All-Star.</p>

<p>2017: 29.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.2. 2nd in MVP voting, 1st All-NBA.</p>

<p>He went on to win MVP and being runner up a couple of more times after that. That year, in 2016 is the most undervalued All NBA player and All Star I&rsquo;ve ever seen, he didn&rsquo;t even get selected. I agree that Randle is disrespected too though.</p>

<p>That might have been true back in the day but there is basically just 3 positions today; guard, wing and big, with some niche players that only play center or PG. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons the NBA changed it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you just want the ten &lsquo;best&rsquo; players go look at the MVP voting breakdown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, if you actually go look at MVP voting you&rsquo;d see that only 2-3 players ever get votes, most often it&rsquo;s just a 1 or 2 horse race, it&rsquo;s not representative at all of a top 10 or 15 players. A lot of years you can get 3rd or 4th in MVP with just a single vote.</p>

Dame was around a top 10-15 player and not getting all star nods due to Curry, Westbrook, CP3, Harden, Klay being in their primes to late primes</p>

<p>Yet the Centers during that era were questionable at best</p>

      <label for="lrwkywa" class="commentText"><p>I’m sure as a Knicks fan, you know all the frustration with Randle.</p>

<p>Dude is talented but not talented enough to be number one or number two option on a deep playoff team. Guy is a ball hog who gets tunnel vision and turns the ball over at the worst times. He’s not a great defender and isn’t good at off the ball either. Not a great shooter.</p>

<p>He’s just a hard fit for most teams especially if they already have a scorer. I think his best role is a sixth man where he can provide a spark with his scoring and playmaking.</p>

<li><p>I think you are greatly overrated Dante&rsquo;s defense, I would not consider him THE best 3-D players in the league.</p></li>

<li><p>Reid doesn&rsquo;t provide nearly the versitility on offense that Kat provides. If Reid&rsquo;s 3 point shot isn&rsquo;t falling, he is not going to provide much else for you in terms of scoring. He was god awful the last 3 games vs the Mavs where he shot 10% from 3. He is a good shooting big man, but that is about the extent of his offensive game. Kat provides so much more in terms of versatilty of scoring, on top of being a much better 3 point shooter.</p></li>

      <label for="lrvq3lc" class="commentText"><p>I agree with both your statements.</p>

<p>However, on the KAT point, you saw first hand how he just doesnt utilize his tools, hes suppossed to be a walking mismatch but complete failed to capitalize on having PJ Washington on him for a playoff series.</p>

<p>Naz Reid is way more one dimensional, but hes not a star player, you can easily bench him or have him take far less shots whereas KAT does need more touches.</p>

      <label for="lrvr56w" class="commentText"><p>I think Kat is just inconsistant, he started to punish the Mavs inside in games <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> - he has the skills to do so it can just very from game to game, but I think he is far more capable of being the 2nd/3rd best player on a championship team than Randle or Dante could be. Kat isn&rsquo;t the top 10 player in the league we once thought he could be, but I think he is capable of playing at that level for certain stretches of time (as we saw in the Nuggs series).</p>

<p>I see Kat as a Love/Bosh type - a guy who isn&rsquo;t going to be your mvp throughout an entire playoff run, but his pressense is instrumental to your success. In the end, I think the Wolves made the trade for financial reasons as opposed to Bball reasons, which Iis the damming part of the trade, imo.</p>

He&rsquo;s going to have to be the second best player, his contract demands it.</p>

<p>Wolves on the other hand match up worse against Jokic/Nuggets than last year, but should match up better against the Thunder and the Mavs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all going to come down to seeding/matchups.</p>

<p>KAT will at least make Embiid defend him or have to play on the perimeter more.</p>

<p>If Mitch never plays again for the Knicks or we don&rsquo;t trade him for another viable big man then sure BUT as presently constructed we are def better than we were when we beat them in 6. They are better too but I think KAT raises our overall ceiling.</p>

He can really get to the rim, especially if he&rsquo;s going against a C (which he probably will be a good chunk of the time). He&rsquo;s also really good on the fast break and has a better post game than people know because he rarely gets to use it. He may get more opportunities now.</p>

      <label for="lrvz2xm" class="commentText"><p>The main thing that differentiates Naz from KAT imo is the handle. KAT goes straight downhill on his drives but Naz tends to put in a dribble move and spin. KATs more foul or finish while Naz takes his time and leads to more kick outs. You see it in the post too. KATs got that one dribble hook or just shoot over wings. Naz uses fakes and spins which take more time to develop but give his teammates more time to get open (or opponents can bring an extra man to contest the shot)</p>

<p>I would not consider him THE best 3-D players in the league.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>100% agree, I mean watching last night&rsquo;s game it seems like Mikal Bridges is a 3 and D guy now, so that title absolutely belongs to him. That said, of the 3-and-D players, Dante is the best at the &ldquo;3&rdquo; part. His defense might be overstated, but he&rsquo;s a dog on that end and the Ant/DDV connection seems to be real. Great pickup for the Wolves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reid doesn&rsquo;t provide nearly the versatility on offense that Kat provides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reid does 90% of what KAT does at 20% of the price, that&rsquo;s a fact. Reid&rsquo;s 3pt shooting is great, but his quick decisions on drives are what sets him apart as a player. Dude hammers mismatches against smaller players, you could make an entire highlight reel of Naz dunking on guys off drives, and takes bigger guys out to the perimeter. He is a worse defender than KAT though, and doesn&rsquo;t have the size to truly be a backup center, so now the Wolves are incredibly reliant on the health of a 32 year old Rudy Gobert.</p>

<p>If Rudy stays healthy and Randle is ok being moved into a souped up version of the role Kyle Anderson played last year (offensive facilitator out of the high post), the Wolves are going to be a better team this year than last.</p>

If you look at the guys who were top 20 in total 3pm made last year, Divincenzo is pretty obviously one of the 3 best defenders in that group.</p>

      <label for="lrvyn2v" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a huge Garza fan and I think his offense is good enough to keep him afloat against opposing benches even though he&rsquo;s too slow footed to play good defense, but against starter level players? Forget about it, he&rsquo;s BBQ chicken.</p>

<p>If Rudy gets hurt, the Wolves are going to have to play a completely different style of basketball to stay in contention.</p>

      <label for="lrvttko" class="commentText"><p>Wolves were #3 in the west last year, won 56 games, and made it to the WCF. I don&rsquo;t think this trade was done for regular season wins.</p>

<p>This move signals that the Wolves GM Tim Connelly thought the team had maxed their potential with the current core, and he decided to retool on the fly while KAT&rsquo;s value was the highest it had been in years. I personally think the pieces fit better now than with KAT playing out of position at the 4.</p>

<p>But you&rsquo;re right, the 2-for-1 should help the Wolves. With the current roster construction, Randle will fill in as the second &ldquo;star&rdquo; and primary scorer and secondary facilitator while Ant is on the bench, and Naz and DDV are the best 6th and 7th man combo in the league. DDV also looks to be the heir apparent to replace Conley as the Wolves starting PG next season. Not a bad haul considering many deemed KAT a negative asset just a couple seasons ago, and they get to offload his new supermax contract on to the Knicks.</p>

      <label for="lrw07gs" class="commentText"><p>Depends on the role, if he expects to be an option 1A like he was on the Knicks? Hell no. But I think the benefit of this trade for both teams is it takes a lot of that pressure to be &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; off of KAT and Randle and allows them to just become another part of the team.</p>

<p>Jury&rsquo;s still out if Randle will willingly take that demotion in a contract year, I think that&rsquo;s the biggest question mark of the entire trade. But if he can become a significantly better version of what Kyle Anderson was for the Wolves last year (high post distributor during the minutes Ant sits, but one that can actually create his own shot and score), he could absolutely be the piece to push the Wolves over the edge.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s unlikely their defense wins them a championship, but they were actually better on offense than defense last year, and added a ton of firepower offensively: they should be in conversation as the best offense in the league this year if everything clicks.</p>

KAT is a really good player but hes way more suited to be a PF because hes good at post defense while being a really mid rim protector. Unless Mitch Rob plays alot and alongside KAT I just fail to see how they&rsquo;ll fare with 2 defensive negatives on the court and a semi weak bench.</p>

      <label for="lrvvap6" class="commentText"><p>KAT is a matchup nightmare at center since he pulls the opposing big out, freeing the lane for guards to drive. Teams go small to guard him, but that still takes the rim protector out of the game. This is the true value of KAT.</p>

<p>If you play him at the 4 like the Wolves have been doing since the Gobert trade, he loses all of that positional mismatch and just becomes a better than average stretch 4 instead of an absolute nightmare mismatch. He has to play the 5 to get value on that supermax. Hopefully OG can protect the rim enough to hide him on the defensive end. Definitely a gamble for the Knicks, but playing 5 out is going to take Brunson&rsquo;s game to the next level.</p>

The spacing on the other end that KAT provides far outweighs whatever negatives he may provide as a rim protector. If we’re getting 3s on the other end and they’re taking tough contested shots at the rim/in the paint, I’ll live with that all day.</p>

<p>The bench is a bit of a concern but Thibs runs a 7-8 man rotation in the playoffs anyway. The Celtics just won a chip with their bench being Sam Hauser/Xavier Tillman/Payton Prichard.</p>

Otherwise he is way better playing at 5.
Offensively, KAT is good against 5 that can’t/don’t want to come out, which help the team spacing/ help the 4 feast on other teams’s 5.
Him playing at 4 means the other team can freely have their 4 guard him on the perimeter and still have a 5 doing help defence</p>

      <label for="lrvxjbw" class="commentText"><p>Last nights game was good reminder of just how much more effective KATs offense is from the 5 vs the 4. Rudy got pulled out of the paint and KATs new whistle is going to make his drives more efficient. He’s going to beat big 5s to the rim and punish the quicker ones at the rim with his new spacing. The wolves never put the shooting around him to discourage double teams like the knicks can. It’s going to be interesting to see if the knicks keep him at the 5 or see how he looks splitting time at the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> like he has with Rudy.</p>

<p>Seeing Ant light up from 3 and get more off ball looks is great. The team is moving faster but they are missing some size. It’s going to be interesting to see how Randle changes those dynamics. Can he keep the pace and will he make up for the missing size? I’m halfway there on DDV and Ant splitting pg duties in the starting lineup. Donte did a good job utilizing Rudy and if that sticks then you don’t need as much from Conley.</p>

<p>Great trade for KAT, good for the knicks, TBD wolves</p>

      <label for="lrwf0n5" class="commentText"><p>KAT will be a great fit for the Knicks, but the trade seems like a big win for the wolves too. The biggest aspect of the trade IMO is the Wolves no longer have to rely on Dillingham for serious minutes this year. As last night showed, Rob is probably going to be very up and down this year.  The wolves have incredible backcourt depth now with Ant, Mike, Donte, and NAW. I do agree Donte should eventually close with Ant - whether a Mike, Ant, Donte, Randle and Rudy lineup or maybe even Ant, Donte, Jaden, Naz and Randle. We now have so much more versatility. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what Finch comes up with.</p>

      <label for="lrwiljg" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s fair.  I personally think the Wolves will greatly benefit from his playmaking, basically filling in for the Kyle role just as much as KAT. Last year it felt like Ant was the only guy who could reliably self-create, and every great team needs multiple playmakers. I also think Randle is incredibly underrated: two-time all-nba player (second team one time) who&rsquo;s always played next to non-shooting bigs like Rudy. The adjustment really shouldn&rsquo;t be that tough.  And even if we go &ldquo;small&rdquo; with Naz at the 5, the size/length of Jaden, Randle, and Ant should be enough to survive against most teams.  Should be fun!</p>

It doesn’t matter the means it took to get the player, just that you have the player. The Knicks didn’t get a better deal because KAT was a former 1st overall pick still with his original team and Randle and Donte were signed as free agents.</p>

<p>The Knicks were able to get two guys who had no real hungry suitors around the league and they both got SO good they could net someone like KAT in a trade.</p>

<p>For Divincenzo, it took merely one season - that&rsquo;s good asset managment.</p>

<p>Series 1 against Philly: shot 36% from 3 and about the same from the field. He made one crazy shot in game 2. Multiple times was benched at the end of games for McBride</p>

<p>Series 2 against Indiana: shot like 43% from three, but in games 4 thru 6 shot a combined <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from 3. Had a crazy game 7… in a 20 point blowout loss. Was forced to take load and play heavy minutes cause of the crazy injuries so he in some games took advantage and in some games stunk</p>

      <label for="lrvti3m" class="commentText"><p>The Randle part is going make it funky. One, he needs a new contract. And two, he’s really not a great fit next playing alongside Ant, McDaniels and Gobert. It will be interesting to see how Finch makes it work.</p>

<p>Donte is going to be an incredible addition for them though. I’m not sure how the rotations will work with Conley back, but they didn’t look bad with Ant basically playing the 1 and Donte the secondary ball handler.</p>

<p>As a Knicks fan, I’m loving seeing a wide open paint area for Brunson to work. The spacing that just the threat of KAT brings is a sight to see after having IHart/Mitch clogging the paint. This trade has definitely affected our depth a bit, and I think Leon has one more move he’s cooking up, but I definitely agree this is a win win.</p>

      <label for="lrw53zj" class="commentText"><p>I didn’t like it at first but when you view it as the Timberwolves looking towards the future while the Knicks trying to win now it makes sense. This wasn’t the all in move for the Knicks. That started when they traded 5 picks for Bridges and maxed OG. This trade is just cementing that decision.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves get Donte who could be a future rotation staple and breathing room to resign the rest of their core. They also got a little deeper as Ant has another person who can put the ball on the ground and score in Randle even though they’re a little redundant together.</p>

      <label for="lrvuo1p" class="commentText"><p>This always feels a little boring to point out, but while Donte was an absolute flamethrower last year from deep, he&rsquo;s just a 37.6% career three point shooter - his track record of being an elite catch and shoot threat is only the last two seasons. I like him and think it&rsquo;s more than coin flip odds that he&rsquo;s actually just improved (especially since that covers &amp;gt;1000 3PA over the last two years), but he still doesn&rsquo;t offer the shooting gravity of a guy like Towns who has a long track record of elite above-the-break shooting (not to mention the positional advantage).</p>

<p>Naz Reid has the same question to answer: he was a 34% shooter going into last season when he took a huge step forward - but is it an outlier? Those years do happen to otherwise middling-to-mediocre shooting talents (Randle 20-21 is a great example), remains to be seen if it&rsquo;s a step forward or a bit of noise for Naz.</p>

<p>And as clunky as that Wolves offense could get at times last year, they look like they may have even less space to operate in. I get why they did it but there are a lot of questions they&rsquo;ll have to answer through the regular season.</p>

      <label for="lrvym3o" class="commentText"><p>Donte had his usual year for the first 45 games last year.  11 pts a game on 5-6 threes attempted a game.  Then Randle got hurt, and he went crazy and doubled his scoring and 3 pt attempts for his last 35 games.  Brunson getting double and triple teamed every game, and Donte being the only secondary option got him an enormous volume of shots that might not be repeatable.</p>

      <label for="lrvzzzd" class="commentText"><p>this trade is obviously lose-lose, players are not stats and numbers like in 2k game, they are real persons, with feelings, emotions, family, friends&hellip;we clearly see, that everybody were surprised with this trade and no one really wanting it, neither traded players, neither the coaches, neither their new/old teammates&hellip;.even when there is great trade for both player and team, it needs time to build chemistry between players, to get used to each other, but in cases like this it will definitely need more time&hellip;so if you have transfer KAT in New York it won&rsquo;t automatically transfer his stats to new team, neither will transfer Divincenzo or Randle stats to Minnesota, neither will Naz Reid automatically get 8ppg,+rpg because he will play +10 mpg&hellip;let&rsquo;s wait and see, but I expect for both teams to be worse then previous year&hellip;people need to realize, trading is not about getting teams better every time, it&rsquo;s about media, agents, everyone get some percent, because we are now all talking about this trade, jersey will be selling, tickets will be selling, it&rsquo;s about money basically, not about improving teams</p>

<p>Wolves lost a big guy that can shoot and got an age Randle that makes spacing worse than what they had before (see WCF last year). </p>
