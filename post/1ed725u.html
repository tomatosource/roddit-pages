    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Curry is, by consensus, still the best shooter alive in 2024, and has been for some time.  However, realistically, there was a time when he first became definitively the best shooter alive and took it from someone else.  Note that I&rsquo;m not talking about the greatest or most accomplished shooter (he&rsquo;s that too, but that&rsquo;s a less interesting conversation).  When was the point in your opinion that it became a fact that there was no active NBA player better at shooting than Curry?  Was it when he was drafted?  Was it when he first led the league in 3pm in 2013?  Was it one of his MVP seasons?</p>

<p>And for further discussion, who would you say he dethroned to take that spot?</p>

      <label for="lf586lj" class="commentText"><p>I remember in 2012-13 when Steph shot 7.5 threes per game (which was like 10th most all time at that point) and people started asking if that was too many.</p>

<p>Around that time, Kirk Goldberry put together a graphic plotting three point volume against accuracy for everyone in the NBA and Steph was, of course, in the tippy-top right corner. Andy Glockner of SI wrote something in response like “I know this is crazy, but should Steph be shooting 12 threes a game?” And lots of smart NBA people were like “12 threes per game is crazy…but, uh, maybe…?”</p>

<p>And then three years later Steph shot 12 threes per game, won MVP, and the Warriors won the title.</p>

<p>So yeah, it was 2012-13 for me.</p>

I remember when Ray Allen broke the 3pt record in 2011, most people were already saying Steph would beat it, and he was in his second year. 2013 was his breakout season, with the 54 points in the garden and he broke the 3pt single season record that year.</p>

      <label for="lf5my7t" class="commentText"><p>He was hyped, and his shooting ability was definitely top tier coming into the league, but people wondered if he would even be good enough to get those type of starter minutes due to his size. Let alone have the greenest light of all time. Honestly credit to mark jackson, despite his penchant for Harrison Barnes isos, really let Steph just do his thing at a time where his playstyle was mostly unheard of for a PG. He was one of the first to realize how great the Splash Bros shooting ability was</p>

      <label for="lf72jy8" class="commentText"><p>I remember a period in his 2nd year when he had small, minor ankle injuries that seemed to hold him back (while still playing through something like 70ish games) then that 3rd year where he missed like <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the season to injury, my friends group was all in on his career being short due to lack of athletic ability+injury concerns. Remember, this was the era where we had guys like Westbrook, Wall and Rose join the league in rapid succession, and suddenly the PG position was filled with Ultra-athletic 6&rsquo;3-6&rsquo;4 slashers with wide wingspans and amazing ability to pass and get to the basket. Not to even mention established stars like CP3, or the rise and fall of Deron Williams in this same timeframe, plus the defenders like Rondo. The leaguebwas filled with guys who were viewed as more athletic and physical than Steph.</p>

<p>But 1 guy in our circle was all about Steph, saying he was going to be a great shooter and probably the best of that group/era because his shooting could carry him late into his 30s while those other players were less likely to last because they only were considered above average because of their athletic ability. Over a decade later and he was right. The longevity of the careers of Rose and Wall were cut shorter by injury, and Westbrook has started to fall back, but held out probably the longest of the other 3 by being so healthy, comparatively.</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s game was certainly the most important thing to maintaining his career longevity, but it seemed sketchy early. Amazing how quickly it changed and he became such a massive icon to the NBA and youth who watch the game.</p>

      <label for="lf5kh93" class="commentText"><p>No he wasn&rsquo;t lol, he was literally a massive name even at Davidson, which is a college no one would have known if not for him.  This dude had Lebron attending his college games, he was not under the radar by any stretch of the imagination.  ESPN was showing Davidson games in primetime coverage a ton, he was a huge deal from the moment he exploded onto the scene in March Madness in 2008.  Then he had another whole year of college being the most hyped college player by far and was a big deal from day 1 in the NBA.  Saying he was under the radar makes absolutely zero sense if you remember the media covering him back then.</p>

<p>He was not under the radar ever in the NBA.  He was very, very much on the radar, he just missed a bunch of time for injuries early on.  That&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t make his first all star game for a few years.  He wasn&rsquo;t under the radar, he just took a while to really find his footing and his health, he was always super talked about though</p>

There was a reason Iguodola got the Finals MVP that year, and it&rsquo;s because noone on that team had star power behind thier name yet besides him, and unfortunately thats what the voters value most. He was just seen as a promising young guy until then, but after leafing a team to the best regular season record of all time, smashing shooting records, and winning a title people saw him im a mew light and the fans swarmed to him. The media no longer had the Miami big 3 to gush over either which helped with the media coverage.</p>

He demolished the Nuggets, that was a very good RS team and played somewhat innovative style by 2013 standards.</p>

<p>Remember 2011-2014. That is all about  Heatles, Classic Spurs, and Big 3 OKC. No one thought warriors were a contender.</p>

<p>Then 2015, Steph lead warriors to the promise land.</p>

<p>Steph also became an official superstar imo in 2014-2015 where he won his first mvp.</p>

Shockingly that was his first year doing it though. Before that it was the usual suspects, Allen, Anderson, Korver, Peja, etc. however, you will never guess, in a thousand guesses, who led the league in 2011</p>

      <label for="lf54wcn" class="commentText"><p>I think there were lots of early signs that he was headed in that direction and people were very aware of it. There&rsquo;s that Knicks game in 2013 where he went 11-13 on 3&rsquo;s, sprinting into those crazy pull-ups. Those types of shots and the insane efficiency already looked extremely unique, even when compared to the greatest shooters of all time. And in those first four seasons, playing in a similar game context to Miller and Allen, his outside shooting percentages were clearly higher than either of those guys.</p>

<p>So people were primed and then when his shooting volume went up, and then up again, and then up again and his efficiency didn&rsquo;t go down at all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say if you&rsquo;re looking for consensus, it&rsquo;d be the offseason after the 2015 finals and his first MVP year. If you&rsquo;re looking for early accurate predictions, I think you could go back to 2013 or 2014 and I think a lot of people were ready to say he was better than anyone had ever been, he just had to keep it up.</p>

<p>There really wasn&rsquo;t a consensus before him.  Ray Allen was arguably the best prior and had led the league in 3PM 3 times.  He also had the record for 3PM in a season at 269 until Steph broke it in 2012-13.</p>

<p>Steph broke his own record by 116 3PM.  That year was insane.</p>

I started to pay attention to his stats game-to-game and was pretty blown away, Then he had that game in the Garden and that&rsquo;s when it solidifed it for me. I think the run they had in the playoffs that year probably did it for most others that season too.</p>

      <label for="lf6q8cr" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, idk if there was really any ONE moment that solidified it to me. I remember watching him at Davidson and thinking holy shit guys like Ray and Reggie especially can&rsquo;t do anything like this. Obviously he needed the volume and this and that to really &ldquo;prove it&rdquo; but I think the eye test even back in college was enough. Dude has some sort of higher power when it comes to shooting. 2015-2016 is still the most mind bending season I&rsquo;ve ever seen and I&rsquo;ve watched Jordan, Lebron, Shaq, etc etc. his second MVP season was the first time I tuned in to EVERY single game of a WC team outside of the Rockets.</p>

      <label for="lf5ebty" class="commentText"><p>For me it was the 2014-15 season with a doubt. To me, his status skyrocketed that season.. and alot of that was Kerr giving him the freedom to shoot as he saw fit.
I knew he was a good shooter at Davidson after seeing some amazing games. Wasn’t sure he’d pan out in the NBA though, but was mildly impressed after the 2nd half of his rookie season when he acclimated. But he kept hurting his ankle so again, some doubt. But the year that he led his team to that first title.. they were virtually unbeatable. And reminded me almost like my Showime Lakers! And it was early on that 2014-15 season when <a href="https://youtu.be/reAbgAuAWR4?si=h8hPEtmLe3GmKTXg" target="_blank">I witnesses this game firsthand!</a>. But at least I got to <a href="https://youtu.be/1y-djvCdyN8?si=sA2PzEOwBjLG_PPa" target="_blank">watch The Black Mamba do his thing as well 😎</a></p>

      <label for="lf6zskf" class="commentText"><p>I think he was seen as a good young player and wasn&rsquo;t really celebrated until that 14-15 season when the Warriors jumped from a good team straight to being the best team. People knew who they were before then but not many were talking about them as anything more than promising young guys until then. While not exactly an overnight sensation, that warriors team did rise quickly. Just a couple years prior thier org was joked about in the same realms as the Kings and Bobcats.</p>

      <label for="lf72jnk" class="commentText"><p>the practically half court shot with time running out in OT against okc. that was the game, and more specifically the moment, people started anointing him. before that no one was pulling up with no hesitation from that distance with the game on the line. league changed after that.</p>

<p>First time I thought there was a worthy challenger to Jesus Shuttlesworth, and at the time Ray was still shooting at a high clip. You could just tell Steph was revving up the engine though.</p>
