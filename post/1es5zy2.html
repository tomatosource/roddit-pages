</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now that the Olympics are behind us, it&rsquo;s time to look ahead to the 2024-25 season.</p>

<p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to preview each team (grouped by <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake" target="_blank">tiers</a> ). In terms of predictions, we&rsquo;re going to avoid hot takes or bold predictions for the sake of drama and simply go with the most realistic outcome. The truth of the matter is: the biggest differentiator between expected success and results tends to be injury related, so it&rsquo;s difficult to peer into the crystal ball on that front. We&rsquo;re also going to balance every team&rsquo;s wins to be an even .500 across the league, which is something most outlets don&rsquo;t bother to do.</p>

<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s cast a look at the pecking order in the <strong>EASTERN CONFERENCE.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>TIER THREE: PUNCH YOUR PLAYOFF TICKETS</strong></p>

<p><strong>(5) CLEVELAND CAVALIERS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>48-34</strong>, +2.4 point differential, # 4 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 18th on offense, 6th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: The Cavs had poor injury luck last year, with Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, and Evan Mobley all missing 20+ games. Their opponent&rsquo;s three-point percentage (37.1%) was also a little better than should be expected. All in all, this was a team that&rsquo;s likely better than their record showed, with <strong>50 wins</strong> being a more expected result.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;subtractions&rdquo;</em>: SF Isaac Okoro (still a RFA)</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: coach Kenny Atkinson, SG Jaylon Tyson &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Clearly, the Cleveland Cavaliers don&rsquo;t fit together like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. If you had to create a team from scratch, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t build around two scoring guards and two bigs with not much in between. Still, the drama (about coaches, about trades, about extensions) may be clouding what is an otherwise rosy situation. After all, this is a team with 4 good young players &ndash; all between the ages of 23-28 &ndash; who have proven to get results together. The Cavs went 51-31 two years ago and 48-34 last year (despite injuries).</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>The biggest change and biggest X-factor may be coach Kenny Atkinson. One potential area of change may be pace of play; the Cavs finished 30th and 22nd in pace the last two seasons. Speeding the game up may improve their offensive rating. It&rsquo;ll also be interesting to see what Akinson does with the back of the rotation. The Cavs have a few shooters (<strong>Georges Niang</strong>, Dean Wade, Sam Merrill) and a few interesting and unheralded guards (Jaylon Tyson, Craig Porter). Will Atkinson settle on one of these players and promote them into a reliable, 25+ minute player? If so, the team can lock in a 8 man rotation that can develop cohesion together.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The Cavs have become the forgotten team out East, but if they settle down and settle in, they should finish around <strong>50-32</strong> and be a playoff lock. Perhaps they have even more upside than that. Remember, critics grumbled about the roster fit in Minnesota until they started to threaten for a # 1 seed.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>Most books have Cleveland around 48.0 wins, which feels quite low given the previous success and the youth on the roster. This is among my strongest recommendations to <strong>bet the OVER</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(6) INDIANA PACERS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>47-35</strong>, +3.1 point differential, # 6 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 2nd in offense, 24th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: The Indiana Pacers made their big trade in midseason, bringing in Pascal Siakam. He played exactly half the season for them (<sup>41</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub> games). If they had him all season long, this same team could have won about <strong>48 or 49</strong> games.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: PF Jalen Smith, PF Doug McDermott</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SG Johnny Furphy &reg;, C James Wiseman</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>The Pacers had an &ldquo;easy road&rdquo; in the playoffs, but their success there showed a lot of positives. Unheralded players like Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith looked like legitimate keepers. For coach Rick Carlisle, that&rsquo;s a good thing &ndash; but also a challenge. Will you risk that chemistry if you work back in your <em>other</em> young players like Bennedict Mathurin and Jarace Walker (who was effectively redshirted as a rookie)? Are we prioritizing their development or a &ldquo;win now&rdquo; approach? The team should have some patience; it&rsquo;s a young roster outside of Pascal Siakam (who turned 30 in April).</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>Coming out of college, the steady <strong>Andrew Nembhard</strong> looked like a low-upside, &ldquo;minutes filler.&rdquo; Although he started <sup>110</sup>&frasl;<sub>143</sub> games in his first two years in the league, he largely played like that, too. He wasn&rsquo;t asked to do much but fit in around the edges: averaging 9.3 points and 4.3 assists. However, when the playoffs came around and he was asked to do more, he stepped up to the plate. He averaged 14.9 points per game on sparkling shooting (56.0% from the field, 48.3% from three). Now that the rotation will return to normal, will he be asked to take a step back again and be (a slightly undersized) 3+D wing? Or will he get more of a role on offense?</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The offense should continue to roll with Tyrese Haliburton, good coaching, and good young pieces across the roster. The biggest question mark is the other end. If you presume that Pascal Siakam can help this defense rise up to the middle of the pack, the Indiana Pacers should finish around <strong>47-35</strong> again this season.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>You can find the Pacers anywhere from 46.5 to 47.5, but neither of those represent great value on a future bet. <strong>Stay away</strong> here.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(7) ORLANDO MAGIC</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>47-35</strong>, +2.0 point differential, # 5 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 22nd on offense, 2nd on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: The Magic were generally healthy as a team last year, with 80 games for Paolo Banchero and 72 for Franz Wagner; that should stay the same or get a little worse. In terms of three-point shooting, it may equalize as well. Wagner shot 28.1% from deep (5% worse than his career average) while Jalen Suggs shot 39.7% (6% worse than his career average). You&rsquo;d expect those two players to settle in closer to 35% each. Overall this team performed around their proper level (maybe slightly overachieving) as their advanced-stats expected record was <strong>46-36</strong>.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: PG Markelle Fultz, SF Joe Ingles, PF Chuma Okeke</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SG Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, SF Tristan da Silva &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>The Magic finished in the bottom 10 in offense again; in fact, they haven&rsquo;t been in the top 20 since Stan Van Gundy left. The primary issue with this version of the team has been their deep shooting. Last season, they were dead last in threes made. They clearly made that a priority with their additions KCP and Tristan da Silva. Perhaps youngsters Jett Howard or Caleb Houstan can add to that as well.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>The biggest wild card on the roster may be sophomore <strong>Anthony Black.</strong> Drafted at # 6, Black had the reputation as a jumbo (6&rsquo;7&rdquo;) point guard &ndash; a very appealing archetype. He didn&rsquo;t show much playmaking in Orlando though, averaging 2.8 assists per 36. So what&rsquo;s he going to be, exactly? A glue guy / defender? He&rsquo;s not a sharpshooter, so he&rsquo;d have a limit in a 3+D role. Perhaps KCP squeezes those minutes from him. Still, Black has intriguing upside so it&rsquo;ll be interesting if the team mines that sooner than later. After all, KCP (at age 31) is a stopgap and not a long-term answer.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>KCP and da Silva should definitely help the team&rsquo;s shooting &ndash; but that&rsquo;s not purely about juicing those 3PA numbers. Adding spacing will also help Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner be more efficient scorers inside the arc. At the same time, let&rsquo;s be prudent in our optimism here. These are good additions but not exactly game changers; da Silva is a rookie and KCP is a 5th starter. The improvements will be modest. All in all, I&rsquo;m expecting about a <strong>47-35</strong> record.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The Magic are listed at 47.5, which is fair and thus a <strong>stay away</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(8) MIAMI HEAT</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>46-36</strong>, +1.7 point differential, # 8 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 21st on offense, 5th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: The Heat&rsquo;s point differential suggested more of a 45 win team, but they also will get Terry Rozier for the entire season. So perhaps that <strong>46 wins</strong> was appropriate.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SG Caleb Martin, PG Delon Wright</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: C Kel&rsquo;el Ware &reg;, SG Alec Burks</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Losing Caleb Martin stings a little, but he&rsquo;s performed more as a league average player than the stud we saw in the Eastern Conference Finals two years back. Still, this is a team that feels like it&rsquo;s on a downward trajectory, largely related to inevitable decline from Jimmy Butler (who will turn 35 in September.) To combat that, they&rsquo;ll need some serious internal improvement from their young prospects and even from rookie Kel&rsquo;el Ware. He has the size and some stretch potential to take pressure off Bam Adebayo down low. If he can be some version of Dereck Lively II for them, perhaps this team has upside left in the tank.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>In addition to Kel&rsquo;el Ware, <strong>Nikola Jovic</strong> could also be a ceiling raiser if he breaks out here in Year 3. Previous rookie Jaime Jaquez got most of the hype from last year, but Jovic is a better shooter and a potentially more dynamic offensive player. Even last year, at age 20, he averaged 14.2 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per 36 with 39.9% shooting from three. If he takes a &ldquo;leap,&rdquo; he could be viewed as a young star.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to make a concrete prediction for the Miami Heat due to baked-in injury concerns. Jimmy Butler could play 70 games &ndash; he could play 40. It&rsquo;s hard to know. If we presume that he&rsquo;ll play about <sup>60</sup>&frasl;<sub>65</sub>, then this team should be in the bottom half of the playoff bracket again. I&rsquo;m a little more optimistic regarding Ware and Jovic than most, so let&rsquo;s give them a record of <strong>45-37</strong>.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>Miami has a listed over/under of 44.5; while that&rsquo;s a little lower than our prediction it&rsquo;s close enough to <strong>stay away</strong>.</p>
