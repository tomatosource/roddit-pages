      <label for="looqcyr" class="commentText"><p>I messed up with the title. It was the Quarter finals, not the Semi finals.</p>

<p>Scottie had played 40 mins and was <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from the field.</p>

<p>He had 25/7/4 + 2 steals and a block.</p>

<p>Up until this point, Tony had only played 13 mins and didn&rsquo;t even start the game.</p>

<p>You can understand Scottie&rsquo;s frustration as MJ had retired so this was HIS time to shine&hellip; But Scottie had played a sloppy 4th quarter and had <strong>badly</strong> missed two shots leading up this point which ultimately led to Ewing tying the game.</p>

<p>Bulls ended up losing the series 3-4 to the Knicks who then went on to beat Indiana but lose to the Rockets in the finals.</p>

      <label for="loorfu0" class="commentText"><p>You have to think it had a BIG effect on the team chemistry going forward after that.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really think of another moment either. Scottie came out of it taking a huge L. He questioned the coach, he questioned his own team mates, made Phil take an extra timeout just to try and get him to man up&hellip; And then had to royally eat humble pie after Tony hits the game winner.</p>

      <label for="loos6g0" class="commentText"><p>Remember watching this game live. Scottie Pippen was on fire and had playing good all game. He was proving his point that year that he could lead a team and be the #1 option while MJ was out.</p>

<p>With the chance to finally prove himself as an elite superstar and not just a #2 guy Phil crushes his optimism. Phil, clearly not wanting Pippen to out shine MJ, chose Kukoc to take the shot over Pippen.</p>

<p>I was just as equally upset for Pippen cause it was the defining moment for him to prove himself and to quit all the naysayers. Phil took that away from him and I can say I agree with Scottie sitting out and not returning in the game.</p>

<p>I think it was all to protect MJ. If Scottie hit that shot it would have been a clear sign that this Bulls team didn&rsquo;t need MJ to win and that Scottie was a legit MVP candidate.</p>
