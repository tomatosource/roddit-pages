<p>I can&rsquo;t really think of another moment either. Scottie came out of it taking a huge L. He questioned the coach, he questioned his own team mates, made Phil take an extra timeout just to try and get him to man up&hellip; And then had to royally eat humble pie after Tony hits the game winner.</p>

<p>1:26 - Phil bodies him by saying he put in a better passer (Pete Myers) and that Scottie had a fat lip and looked ugly out there. Sheesh.</p>

      <label for="lop0mdu" class="commentText"><p>Despite being 26, Toni was only a rookie.</p>

<p>Scottie and MJ had a bit of hatred for Toni due to Jerry Krause. Jerry had a bit of an obsession for Toni which stemmed back to 1990. It&rsquo;s why Scottie and MJ absolutely dogged on him during the 1992 olympics. MJ famously said that &ldquo;We were playing against Jerry Krause in a Croatian uniform&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think this is also why Scottie was extra hurt.</p>

I was thinking of a moment in which the best player on the team was on the bench and the team won a game in spite of him playing just like this scanerio. Harden made up for it game 7. Also I think cle did it vs indy in 2017 when kyrie and love was on the bench and came back from 25</p>

      <label for="loow9p4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s really hurt his popularity. There are good reasons for fans to argue <em>for</em> Pippen. He was screwed on his contract, and his greatness was definitely overshadowed by MJ. He&rsquo;s exactly the kind of player where fans should be saying, &ldquo;Oh, you have no idea how good Pippen really was. He was a dawg.&rdquo; Insatead, old heads remember him complaining in this ge and refusing to go on the court when his team needed him most. And the younger generation are experiencing him as a bitter old dude.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still recognized as one of the greats, but he could&rsquo;ve been quite the fan favorite if he had a better attitude.</p>

<p>Scottie had played 40 mins and was <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from the field.</p>

<p>He had 25/7/4 + 2 steals and a block.</p>

<p>Up until this point, Tony had only played 13 mins and didn&rsquo;t even start the game.</p>

<p>You can understand Scottie&rsquo;s frustration as MJ had retired so this was HIS time to shine&hellip; But Scottie had played a sloppy 4th quarter and had <strong>badly</strong> missed two shots leading up this point which ultimately led to Ewing tying the game.</p>

<p>Bulls ended up losing the series 3-4 to the Knicks who then went on to beat Indiana but lose to the Rockets in the finals.</p>

      <label for="loowmgp" class="commentText"><p>My theory is this&hellip; Scottie had 11 older siblings and was the youngest out of them all. He was desperate to stand out and desperate to be <strong>the</strong> guy but he was cursed (lol) with having MJ as a team mate. He won&hellip; A lot&hellip; But was always Robin when his dream was to be Batman. That&rsquo;s why I think he&rsquo;s miserable because the one time he thought he had the chance to prove it, Phil chose a guy who had barely played in that game.</p>

      <label for="loos6g0" class="commentText"><p>Remember watching this game live. Scottie Pippen was on fire and had playing good all game. He was proving his point that year that he could lead a team and be the #1 option while MJ was out.</p>

<p>With the chance to finally prove himself as an elite superstar and not just a #2 guy Phil crushes his optimism. Phil, clearly not wanting Pippen to out shine MJ, chose Kukoc to take the shot over Pippen.</p>

<p>I was just as equally upset for Pippen cause it was the defining moment for him to prove himself and to quiet all the naysayers. Phil took that away from him and I can say I agree with Scottie sitting out and not returning in the game.</p>

<p>I think it was all to protect MJ. If Scottie hit that shot it would have been a clear sign that this Bulls team didn&rsquo;t need MJ to win and that Scottie was a legit MVP candidate that season.</p>

      <label for="lootljh" class="commentText"><p>So Phil Jackson&rsquo;s primary goal after MJ retired was to make MJ look good. Not win because he likes winning, not win because it makes himself look good, not win because it would make him a bunch money, he actually wanted to lose to make MJ look good. In that case, honestly I think he could have done a better tank job than going to the playoffs and game 7.</p>

      <label for="loou58z" class="commentText"><p>The right call was made. Scottie had a stellar game up until the final few mins. He had gone cold and was starting to shit the bed. Phil noticed it and took the ball out of his hands.</p>

<p>I disagree strongly about your &lsquo;protecting MJ&rsquo; theory. Phil wanted to win. That&rsquo;s all that matters. If Scottie hit that shot they would have gone to game 4&hellip; They hadn&rsquo;t won the series. The Kicks were legit, the Pacers were really solid and the Rockets were on another level. It was a tough path to the finals.</p>

<p>Scottie could have been on the court and created an easier shot for Tony because he was most likely going to be double teamed. He most likely regrets his decision to this day.</p>

<p>Just remember what Marsellus Wallace said - ¬†&rdquo;<strong>The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.</strong>¬†<strong>That&rsquo;s pride fucking with you.</strong>¬†<strong>Fuck pride.</strong>¬†<strong>Pride only hurts, it never helps.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Scottie let his pride take him out of a huge game.</p>

<p>Remember watching this game live. Scottie Pippen was on fire and had playing good all game. He was proving his point that year that he could lead a team and be the #1 option while MJ was out.</p>

<p>With the chance to finally prove himself as an elite superstar and not just a #2 guy Phil crushes his optimism. Phil, clearly not wanting Pippen to out shine MJ, chose Kukoc to take the shot over Pippen.</p>

<p>I was just as equally upset for Pippen cause it was the defining moment for him to prove himself and to quiet all the naysayers. Phil took that away from him and I can say I agree with Scottie sitting out and not returning in the game.</p>

<p>I think it was all to protect MJ. If Scottie hit that shot it would have been a clear sign that this Bulls team didn&rsquo;t need MJ to win and that Scottie was a legit MVP candidate that season.</p>

<p>This here, kids, is what we called in the old country basketball-stupid.</p>

<p>In that cavalcade of ignorance you posted, this particular sentence stands out as perhaps one of the dumbest things ever written in the NBA sub about anyone or anything at any time.</p>
