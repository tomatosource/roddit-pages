<p>I can&rsquo;t really think of another moment either. Scottie came out of it taking a huge L. He questioned the coach, he questioned his own team mates, made Phil take an extra timeout just to try and get him to man up&hellip; And then had to royally eat humble pie after Tony hits the game winner.</p>

<p>1:26 - Phil bodies him by saying he put in a better passer (Pete Myers) and that Scottie had a fat lip and looked ugly out there. Sheesh.</p>

      <label for="lop0mdu" class="commentText"><p>Despite being 26, Toni was only a rookie.</p>

<p>Scottie and MJ had a bit of hatred for Toni due to Jerry Krause. Jerry had a bit of an obsession for Toni which stemmed back to 1990. It&rsquo;s why Scottie and MJ absolutely dogged on him during the 1992 olympics. MJ famously said that &ldquo;We were playing against Jerry Krause in a Croatian uniform&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think this is also why Scottie was extra hurt as Kraus was getting what he wanted.</p>

      <label for="loppveg" class="commentText"><p>It really makes you wonder how the moment would have aged had Kukoc missed.</p>

<p>I mean Pippen still doesn&rsquo;t look good, of course, but a big part of the narrative is they won with Pippen on the bench.  If he missed then Phil undoubtedly takes a lot more heat for drawing up a play for Kukoc instead of Pippen.  It&rsquo;s probably Phil eating humble pie after the game.  If he missed then the Knicks might have gone up 3-0 and a demoralized Bulls team ends losing the series in 4 or 5 games.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame this moment has overshadowed so much in Pippen&rsquo;s career because not only was he a great player but he was fantastic in this series.</p>

      <label for="loow9p4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s really hurt his popularity. There are good reasons for fans to argue <em>for</em> Pippen. He was screwed on his contract, and his greatness was definitely overshadowed by MJ. He&rsquo;s exactly the kind of player where fans should be saying, &ldquo;Oh, you have no idea how good Pippen really was. He was a dawg.&rdquo; Insatead, old heads remember him complaining in this ge and refusing to go on the court when his team needed him most. And the younger generation are experiencing him as a bitter old dude.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still recognized as one of the greats, but he could&rsquo;ve been quite the fan favorite if he had a better attitude.</p>

No obligation too, but probably could have gotten a much different attitude and more production out of Pippen. Likely wouldn&rsquo;t have changed much, except for a smoother transition into the post Jordan era. One could argue the bulls are still suffering from the way the team blew up.</p>

      <label for="lopa3kz" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that.</p>

<p>The Bulls gave Scottie a really shitty contract, knowing that he would sign it asap because he comes from a very large and very poor family with two members who suffer from paralysis.</p>

<p>Scottie was desperate to provide for his family and as a wide-eyed kid, who wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the long term effects, he took the shit deal.</p>

<p>Of course, time went on and he regretted signing himself into a relatively poor deal, but instead of continuing to put up good performances and increasing his stock as a player, he decided to start pulling crap like this which affected his image very negatively.</p>

<p>He was a wide eyed kid, dirt poor when he signed the contract. He was taken advantage of and that sucked. But the way he reacted was wrong and stupid.</p>

<p>Reinsdorf played him like a fiddle.</p>

Then he changed his mind years later when the new TV deal kicked in and wanted to renegotiate the deal.</p>

<p>Jordan was on a equally shitty deal and was forced to play out that contract too, then got paid his worth for his last 2 years with the Bulls. In fact, relative to his production he actually had a worse contract than Pippen.</p>

My mom’s friend got us tickets right by the tunnel and I was maybe 12 or 13 at the time. I got to high five 3 players that night… Shawn Kemp (my favorite player at that time), Pippen and Kucoc. Kucoc’s hand was the sweatiest and grossest. It made me say “bleeeeh” out loud. I don’t think he heard me though. This adds nothing to the Pippen legacy conversation but I don’t get to tell this story often and it’s my only personal story that involves both players.</p>

<p>KD SEEMS unhappy to some but the root is that he&rsquo;s trying to find somewhere that he feels loved and respected.</p>

<p>Pippen comes off as unhappy to some because he&rsquo;s envious of other players, namely his teammates, who are always publicly given him praise.</p>

      <label for="looqcyr" class="commentText"><p>I messed up with the title. Toni autocorrected to Tony.</p>

<p>Scottie had played 40 mins and was <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from the field.</p>

<p>He had 25/7/4 + 2 steals and a block.</p>

<p>Up until this point, Tony had only played 13 mins and didn&rsquo;t even start the game.</p>

<p>You can understand Scottie&rsquo;s frustration as MJ had retired so this was HIS time to shine&hellip; But Scottie had played a sloppy 4th quarter and had <strong>badly</strong> missed two shots leading up this point which ultimately led to Ewing tying the game.</p>

<p>Bulls ended up losing the series 3-4 to the Knicks who then went on to beat Indiana but lose to the Rockets in the finals.</p>

Your thinking about the slow/dead ball era but that wasn&rsquo;t till 96 and onwards primarily early 2000s. The early 90s was still fast paced and high scoring.</p>

      <label for="looxbdc" class="commentText"><p>This is admittedly based on memory alone, but I never thought Scottie was (offensively) impressive in the clutch. Sure, he didn&rsquo;t get much experience taking big shots by playing so much with MJ, but I never trusted him to knock them down. I think Phil giving Toni the shot was about that as well as Pippen &lsquo;being a decoy&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Jordan didn’t sit out. Instead, he went off script, ran into Toni’s space, forced the pass to himself, then chucked up a shot that missed, lol.</p>

That isn’t even demeaning to him, how many players are actually good enough to take random underachieving franchises to the finals? The Bulls ceiling capped out at ECSF with him as the best player, and that’s about right. Maybe a ECF, but Scottie was never the caliber of player who could be the best player on a championship team.</p>

If you&rsquo;d lived through the timeline where the Bulls missed the final shot with Scottie on the floor (as he and I have done) then you&rsquo;d understand why he needed to be off the floor for this.

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Pippen was having a good game, up until he started wavering in the 4th.</p>

<p>Jackson wrote up a play, Scottie wasn&rsquo;t the shot taker and he got pissed.</p>

<p>A more mature player would recognise that they have a cold hand at that moment and that the coach is trying to orchestrate a play to win the game.</p>

<p>The problem was Scottie&rsquo;s mindset. He was still one of the best players on the court that day, but rather than accept the play for the sake of the team, he was angry that he wasn&rsquo;t the shot taker.</p>

<p>Phil made the right call.</p>

      <label for="lopirbv" class="commentText"><p>Yes, Phil made the right basketball call, and the right call for the team. Scottie made the wrong basketball play by sitting out. But that&rsquo;s not what this conversation is really about.</p>

<p>This conversation is really about how we think about Scottie Pippen&rsquo;s moral character, and as a man.</p>

<p>A person&rsquo;s motivations and aspirations will not always align with the motivations of their employer. In fact, the operating frameworks may not even be the same. That&rsquo;s the case here.</p>

<p>This shot - to Phil Jackson - was about winning a playoff game.</p>

<p>This shot - to Scottie Pippen - was about self-actualization - distilling a lifetime of overcoming struggle to culminate in a single victorious moment. Winning the game is a byproduct of making the shot.</p>

<p>Is that &lsquo;selfish&rsquo;? Absolutely - but I&rsquo;m never going to fault anyone from trying to achieve self-actualization. That&rsquo;s pretty much the primary goal of one&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s especially true when they have carried the team to where they are in the first place and &lsquo;earned&rsquo; the right to be selfish..</p>

<p>But Phil has said some ridiculous stuff in his time and you&rsquo;d think a guy whose managerial career was built with work from some of the best black players, would think a bit more before choosing to say some of the things he did.</p>

<p>The guy complained about the Black Lives Matter stuff when the NBA became involved in it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like how Bob Cousy called Trump the best president of his lifetime or some shit like that.</p>

      <label for="lopn3ri" class="commentText"><p>Completely agree, thought this being such a large data point in his history wasn’t fair to him. His entire career he was a compliment to MJ and saw first hand how the guy would get this shot in crunch time. This year he became the guy, but he was a different type of archetype. I don’t remember the media conversations then, but even mainstream media now is poorly equipped to handle a facilitator as the best player. I think that’s why a lot of conversations are around LeBron comparisons to MJ instead of Magic.</p>

<p>Kukoc was the right guy for the shot, but Pippen earned the right to take that shot. It’s a shame that’s how we remember him, instead of the all around player he was.</p>

Of course, Scottie was humiliated that MJ was gone and Phil was going to make him stand there in front of the whole sports world and still defer to somebody else on the last possession. I believe the solution that other superstars employ, if they can&rsquo;t just take the clipboard away and yell &ldquo;absolutely not&rdquo; as Lebron did, is to steal the inbounding pass and take the shot anyway. I guess Phil making Scottie inbound was a chess move to prevent this too.</p>

      <label for="lop8nu7" class="commentText"><p>It’s still wild to me that he didn’t swallow his pride when asked about this moment on the Last Dance. Him saying he’d do it all over again just makes him look like a bitter old man. He could have repaired this to a great extent. It’s kind of a shame that an incredible career and legacy has that kind of stain.</p>

      <label for="lopae35" class="commentText"><p>Obviously he was wrong in how he handled it but strictly strategically speaking I agree with his train of thought. If I’m not mistaken Jackson wanted him to inbound the ball which is really asinine when u consider the other players the had. Scottie actually gave cover for defense’s huge failure of allowing kukoc to catch the pass at the top of the key</p>
