<p>I can&rsquo;t really think of another moment either. Scottie came out of it taking a huge L. He questioned the coach, he questioned his own team mates, made Phil take an extra timeout just to try and get him to man up&hellip; And then had to royally eat humble pie after Tony hits the game winner.</p>

<p>1:26 - Phil bodies him by saying he put in a better passer (Pete Myers) and that Scottie had a fat lip and looked ugly out there. Sheesh.</p>

      <label for="lop0mdu" class="commentText"><p>Despite being 26, Toni was only a rookie.</p>

<p>Scottie and MJ had a bit of hatred for Toni due to Jerry Krause. Jerry had a bit of an obsession for Toni which stemmed back to 1990. It&rsquo;s why Scottie and MJ absolutely dogged on him during the 1992 olympics. MJ famously said that &ldquo;We were playing against Jerry Krause in a Croatian uniform&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think this is also why Scottie was extra hurt as Kraus was getting what he wanted.</p>

<p>Bird passed it to Dennis Johnson after making the steal vs DET, instead of trying to take the shot himself.</p>

<p>Bird and Magic were all about making the right play. Granted, most times the right play was &ldquo;give it to Bird.&rdquo;</p>

It is extremely difficult to give them a scenario they haven&rsquo;t seen and are uncomfortable with and somehow not completely destroying your defense. Doubling them might still keep them in plan A territory and they still might take the shot. They know exactly how much space they need.</p>

<p>So funny to hear people argue that the playstyle is bad when these guys have a stupid number of championships playing exactly like they do. &lsquo;Like oh so and so would have 6-7 rings instead of 5 if they changed their play&rsquo; lmao.</p>

<p>And yet, they go on to win THREE MORE CHAMPIONSHIPS in a row together. Does team chemistry not matter that much, or was MJ just that good?</p>

<p>Bulls should&rsquo;ve won the next game. They led the Knicks with less than 3 seconds in G5.  Hubert Green takes a 3 which Pippen partially tips. Bulls rebound and it should be FTs on the other side?</p>

<p>Except Hue Hollins calls a bullshit foul on the shot. Everyone admits it was a bullshit foul.  Bulls then win G6 but lose G7.</p>

      <label for="loow9p4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s really hurt his popularity. There are good reasons for fans to argue <em>for</em> Pippen. He was screwed on his contract, and his greatness was definitely overshadowed by MJ. He&rsquo;s exactly the kind of player where fans should be saying, &ldquo;Oh, you have no idea how good Pippen really was. He was a dawg.&rdquo; Insatead, old heads remember him complaining in this ge and refusing to go on the court when his team needed him most. And the younger generation are experiencing him as a bitter old dude.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still recognized as one of the greats, but he could&rsquo;ve been quite the fan favorite if he had a better attitude.</p>

My mom’s friend got us tickets right by the tunnel and I was maybe 12 or 13 at the time. I got to high five 3 players that night… Shawn Kemp (my favorite player at that time), Pippen and Kucoc. Kucoc’s hand was the sweatiest and grossest. It made me say “bleeeeh” out loud. I don’t think he heard me though. This adds nothing to the Pippen legacy conversation but I don’t get to tell this story often and it’s my only personal story that involves both players.</p>

<p>They got 6 rings as-is, seems like a pretty good deal for Reinsdorf - who doesn&rsquo;t care about basketball anyways.</p>

<p>This is the same guy who said he&rsquo;d trade all 6 Bulls titles for 1 White Sox championship.</p>

      <label for="lopa3kz" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that.</p>

<p>The Bulls gave Scottie a really shitty contract, knowing that he would sign it asap because he comes from a very large and very poor family with two members who suffer from paralysis.</p>

<p>Scottie was desperate to provide for his family and as a wide-eyed kid, who wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the long term effects, he took the shit deal.</p>

<p>Of course, time went on and he regretted signing himself into a relatively poor deal, but instead of continuing to put up good performances and increasing his stock as a player, he decided to start pulling crap like this which affected his image very negatively.</p>

<p>He was a wide eyed kid, dirt poor when he signed the contract. He was taken advantage of and that sucked. But the way he reacted was wrong and stupid.</p>

<p>Reinsdorf played him like a fiddle.</p>

Then he changed his mind years later when the new TV deal kicked in and wanted to renegotiate the deal.</p>

<p>Jordan was on a equally shitty deal and was forced to play out that contract too, then got paid his worth for his last 2 years with the Bulls. In fact, relative to his production he actually had a worse contract than Pippen.</p>

<p>Scottie had played 40 mins and was <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from the field.</p>

<p>He had 25/7/4 + 2 steals and a block.</p>

<p>Up until this point, Tony had only played 13 mins and didn&rsquo;t even start the game.</p>

<p>You can understand Scottie&rsquo;s frustration as MJ had retired so this was HIS time to shine&hellip; But Scottie had played a sloppy 4th quarter and had <strong>badly</strong> missed two shots leading up this point which ultimately led to Ewing tying the game.</p>

<p>Bulls ended up losing the series 3-4 to the Knicks who then went on to beat Indiana but lose to the Rockets in the finals.</p>

<p>But Jordan didn’t sit out. Instead, he went off script, ran into Toni’s space, forced the pass to himself, then chucked up a shot that missed, lol.</p>

      <label for="lose4fk" class="commentText"><p>I can understand that line of thought, but to me it is quite different. I would have preferred Pip went out there and blew up the play rather than sit out.</p>

<p>Neither move is ideal, but sitting out seems like quitting and letting your teammates down. It&rsquo;s not something you expect of your leader and best player.</p>

<p>The whole episode reminds me of a story that Bob Pettit has shared&hellip; it was late in a game and the Hawks were down and setting up for a final shot. Pettit was the premier scorer of his day (he held the record for career points for a spell, was the first person to ever drop 50 in a Finals game, etc.) and the leader of the team, so you&rsquo;d expect the ball to go to him for that final shot.</p>

<p>The coach, however, drew up a play for a different player. Pettit didn&rsquo;t sit or complain. But as they were walking onto the floor, the Hawks PG (Slater Martin) came up to Pettit and said, in essence, &ldquo;Nuts to the play the coach drew up, I&rsquo;m gonna get you the ball and you take us home.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="looxbdc" class="commentText"><p>This is admittedly based on memory alone, but I never thought Scottie was (offensively) impressive in the clutch. Sure, he didn&rsquo;t get much experience taking big shots by playing so much with MJ, but I never trusted him to knock them down. I think Phil giving Toni the shot was about that as well as Pippen &lsquo;being a decoy&rsquo;</p>

That isn’t even demeaning to him, how many players are actually good enough to take random underachieving franchises to the finals? The Bulls ceiling capped out at ECSF with him as the best player, and that’s about right. Maybe a ECF, but Scottie was never the caliber of player who could be the best player on a championship team.</p>

His skill set was just that adaptable. For his position he was elite at everything except leadership and scoring which he was still pretty good at. Sucks his own ego got in the way of how people should view him.</p>

<p>Look at all of these people in perspective. Jordan still hates Thomas decades later. Jordan is a multimillionaire. So is Thomas.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s upset because he actions that Thomas took in the context of a game. Not war. Not life&ndash;thomas didn&rsquo;t sleep with Jordans wife or anything. A game that they played together and made them both rich.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Pippen was having a good game, up until he started wavering in the 4th.</p>

<p>Jackson wrote up a play, Scottie wasn&rsquo;t the shot taker and he got pissed.</p>

<p>A more mature player would recognise that they have a cold hand at that moment and that the coach is trying to orchestrate a play to win the game.</p>

<p>The problem was Scottie&rsquo;s mindset. He was still one of the best players on the court that day, but rather than accept the play for the sake of the team, he was angry that he wasn&rsquo;t the shot taker.</p>

<p>Phil made the right call.</p>

      <label for="lopirbv" class="commentText"><p>Yes, Phil made the right basketball call, and the right call for the team. Scottie made the wrong basketball play by sitting out. But that&rsquo;s not what this conversation is really about.</p>

<p>This conversation is really about how we think about Scottie Pippen&rsquo;s moral character, and as a man.</p>

<p>A person&rsquo;s motivations and aspirations will not always align with the motivations of their employer. In fact, the operating frameworks may not even be the same. That&rsquo;s the case here.</p>

<p>This shot - to Phil Jackson - was about winning a playoff game.</p>

<p>This shot - to Scottie Pippen - was about self-actualization - distilling a lifetime of overcoming struggle to culminate in a single victorious moment. Winning the game is a byproduct of making the shot.</p>

<p>Is that &lsquo;selfish&rsquo;? Absolutely - but I&rsquo;m never going to fault anyone from trying to achieve self-actualization. That&rsquo;s pretty much the primary goal of one&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s especially true when they have carried the team to where they are in the first place and &lsquo;earned&rsquo; the right to be selfish..</p>

      <label for="loqkxe3" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a good guy and his backstory is tragic. An interesting read. iirc MJ is a big reason he was on the Bulls. Kind of pulled some strings for him to get a shot and he made the most of it.</p>

<p>Not to dispel the MJ is an asshole stuff too much but I definitely remember listening (on some podcast?) about Williams talking on how Jordan would regularly call and check up on him after what happened while he was still in college (Jordan probably like 4-5 years into the league at that point).</p>

      <label for="lopn3ri" class="commentText"><p>Completely agree, thought this being such a large data point in his history wasn’t fair to him. His entire career he was a compliment to MJ and saw first hand how the guy would get this shot in crunch time. This year he became the guy, but he was a different type of archetype. I don’t remember the media conversations then, but even mainstream media now is poorly equipped to handle a facilitator as the best player. I think that’s why a lot of conversations are around LeBron comparisons to MJ instead of Magic.</p>

<p>Kukoc was the right guy for the shot, but Pippen earned the right to take that shot. It’s a shame that’s how we remember him, instead of the all around player he was.</p>
