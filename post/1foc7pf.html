<p>I can&rsquo;t really think of another moment either. Scottie came out of it taking a huge L. He questioned the coach, he questioned his own team mates, made Phil take an extra timeout just to try and get him to man up&hellip; And then had to royally eat humble pie after Tony hits the game winner.</p>

<p>1:26 - Phil bodies him by saying he put in a better passer (Pete Myers) and that Scottie had a fat lip and looked ugly out there. Sheesh.</p>

      <label for="lop0mdu" class="commentText"><p>Despite being 26, Toni was only a rookie.</p>

<p>Scottie and MJ had a bit of hatred for Toni due to Jerry Krause. Jerry had a bit of an obsession for Toni which stemmed back to 1990. It&rsquo;s why Scottie and MJ absolutely dogged on him during the 1992 olympics. MJ famously said that &ldquo;We were playing against Jerry Krause in a Croatian uniform&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think this is also why Scottie was extra hurt as Kraus was getting what he wanted.</p>

Also I think cle did it vs indy in 2017 when kyrie and love was on the bench and came back from 25</p>

      <label for="lop6ph5" class="commentText"><p>I mean, star players get benched and their team comes back and wins relatively frequently. This is just a completely different scenario, imo, and the two don&rsquo;t compare at all. Pippen refused to enter the game because he wasn&rsquo;t getting the last shot. That really fucks up chemistry, star players sitting for a comeback is a coaching decision and is completely different</p>

</blockquote>

<p>IIRC it happened with the Bulls against Portland in Game 6 in their Finals matchup. While being down in the third, MJ blew a layup, and Pippen was doing woefully in the field. Phil Jackson gave MJ some much-needed rest and put in Scott Hansen. He sparked a Bulls comeback with a made three and a steal, and MJ, with fresh legs, sealed the deal in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <label for="lop7yl7" class="commentText"><p>I said not to this degree and it does happen so it ok to point out what&rsquo;s wrong with that. If I said verbatim harden did exactly this I get the pushback. Not to this degree means similar. Benching is not equal to coming back in the game but it&rsquo;s similar to not being on the court. That&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m making. I don&rsquo;t know if anybody did what pippen did in this scanerio besides draymond threatening not to play at halftime in the locker room (I forgot against what team).</p>

<p>I love your take on it though. Especially compared to the Pippen moment. Harden has always been a good teammate until the day he recognized he wasn’t going to be on a Rocket championship team and wanted out.</p>

      <label for="lop62sn" class="commentText"><p>Do ppl read my original comment or what? I said not to this degree if pippen but a similar situation in which the team won in spite of a player playing was harden. I didn&rsquo;t say 100% exactly this is what happened in the hou vs lac game 6 game in 2015. What does not to this degree mean to u ppl exactly the same?</p>

      <label for="lop8spq" class="commentText"><p>Hey man if you can’t handle criticism on your comment don’t deflect on the rest of us.</p>

<p>Fact of the matter is the Pippen situation and what you describe with the Rockets are not similar in any way except “star player was on the bench”. They weren’t on the bench for the same reason, they didn’t have the same attitude while on the bench, and the situation on the court was completely different between the two. You seeing Harden on the bench as his team rallies and thinking “man this is just like when Pippen threw a bitch fit and Toni Kukoc won them the game on a game winner” makes no sense, and now you’re getting defensive when people are rightfully telling you it’s not an accurate comparison at all</p>

      <label for="lop9bjl" class="commentText"><p>If you’re trying to compare moments you should be looking for a time that a player looked like a selfish ass.  Pippen took himself out of the game because his fragile ego was hurt and he seemed to be totally fine with losing the game to prove a point.</p>

<p>Harden was being given a breather by his coach and the bench started going off.  It had nothing to do with Harden being selfish or having too big an ego, he even cheered his teammates on.</p>

<p>It’s not that this isn’t to the same degree, it’s that they aren’t comparable situations at all.</p>

<p>Edit: to simplify- the only comparison here is that Harden showed how to be a good teammate whereas Pippen was a selfish prick.  Absolute opposites</p>

He was their best player for the majority of the series and he showed up in Game 6 and 7. There weren&rsquo;t any issues with his teammates either. It&rsquo;s not the same as what happened with Pippen. That being said, fuck Josh Smith and Corey Brewer. I&rsquo;ll never forget what they did. Sigh..</p>

      <label for="loow9p4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s really hurt his popularity. There are good reasons for fans to argue <em>for</em> Pippen. He was screwed on his contract, and his greatness was definitely overshadowed by MJ. He&rsquo;s exactly the kind of player where fans should be saying, &ldquo;Oh, you have no idea how good Pippen really was. He was a dawg.&rdquo; Insatead, old heads remember him complaining in this ge and refusing to go on the court when his team needed him most. And the younger generation are experiencing him as a bitter old dude.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still recognized as one of the greats, but he could&rsquo;ve been quite the fan favorite if he had a better attitude.</p>

No obligation too, but probably could have gotten a much different attitude and more production out of Pippen. Likely wouldn&rsquo;t have changed much, except for a smoother transition into the post Jordan era. One could argue the bulls are still suffering from the way the team blew up.</p>

<p>The Bulls gave Scottie a really shitty contract, knowing that he would sign it asap because he comes from a very large and very poor family with two members who suffer from paralysis.</p>

<p>Scottie was desperate to provide for his family and as a wide-eyed kid, who wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the long term effects, he took the shit deal.</p>

<p>Of course, time went on and he regretted signing himself into a relatively poor deal, but instead of continuing to put up good performances and increasing his stock as a player, he decided to start pulling crap like this which affected his image very negatively.</p>

<p>He was a wide eyed kid, dirt poor when he signed the contract. He was taken advantage of and that sucked. But the way he reacted was wrong and stupid.</p>

<p>Reinsdorf played him like a fiddle.</p>

My mom’s friend got us tickets right by the tunnel and I was maybe 12 or 13 at the time. I got to high five 3 players that night… Shawn Kemp (my favorite player at that time), Pippen and Kucoc. Kucoc’s hand was the sweatiest and grossest. It made me say “bleeeeh” out loud. I don’t think he heard me though. This adds nothing to the Pippen legacy conversation but I don’t get to tell this story often and it’s my only personal story that involves both players.</p>

<p>Pippen comes off as unhappy to some because he&rsquo;s envious of other players, namely his teammates, who are always publicly given him praise.</p>

<p>ESPN was doing their “lol blazers” thing so Sheed may have been undervalued on ESPN, but anyone who watched basketball knew the Pistons were stacked with Sheed on the team. </p>

<p>I’m not saying it was a KD to Warriors type event, but anyone who wanted to get out of the East was feeling the pain that day, majorly. </p>

<p>Scottie had played 40 mins and was <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from the field.</p>

<p>He had 25/7/4 + 2 steals and a block.</p>

<p>Up until this point, Tony had only played 13 mins and didn&rsquo;t even start the game.</p>

<p>You can understand Scottie&rsquo;s frustration as MJ had retired so this was HIS time to shine&hellip; But Scottie had played a sloppy 4th quarter and had <strong>badly</strong> missed two shots leading up this point which ultimately led to Ewing tying the game.</p>

<p>Bulls ended up losing the series 3-4 to the Knicks who then went on to beat Indiana but lose to the Rockets in the finals.</p>

      <label for="lootu8y" class="commentText"><p>I thinks it&rsquo;s interesting to see people&rsquo;s emotional states and insecurities playing out in public display. We all have them but when you are a pro athlete its almost on display for the world to see.</p>

<p>I would like to peer into Pippens brain and see what kind of childhood or adult emotional events that led him to behave this way.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still an issue for him because to this day he sounds miserable (not even including this incident)</p>

      <label for="loowmgp" class="commentText"><p>My theory is this&hellip; Scottie had 11 older siblings and was the youngest out of them all. He was desperate to stand out and desperate to be <strong>the</strong> guy but he was cursed (lol) with having MJ as a team mate. He won&hellip; A lot&hellip; But was always Robin when his dream was to be Batman. That&rsquo;s why I think he&rsquo;s miserable because the one time he thought he had the chance to prove it, Phil chose a rookie who had barely played in that game.</p>

<p>Bill Simmons said it best - this was Pippen&rsquo;s moment, and Phil denied him the chance to rise to the occasion.</p>

<p>Linking the article, from when Simmons actually wrote good stuff: <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/4/19/21225904/scottie-pippen-bill-simmons-book-of-basketball-hall-of-fame-pyramid" target="_blank">https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/4/19/21225904/scottie-pippen-bill-simmons-book-of-basketball-hall-of-fame-pyramid</a></p>

      <label for="lopd68o" class="commentText"><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t deny him anything. Scottie was having a rough 4th quarter and his misses led to the Knicks getting points on the board.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Pippen was having a good game, up until he started wavering in the 4th.</p>

<p>Jackson wrote up a play, Scottie wasn&rsquo;t the shot taker and he got pissed.</p>

<p>A more mature player would recognise that they have a cold hand at that moment and that the coach is trying to orchestrate a play to win the game.</p>

<p>The problem was Scottie&rsquo;s mindset. He was still one of the best players on the court that day, but rather than accept the play for the sake of the team, he was angry that he wasn&rsquo;t the shot taker.</p>

<p>Phil made the right call.</p>

There must be a reason!  He has to be a good guy, underneath, and it must be the mean old world that turned him into an asshole.  He can&rsquo;t just be an asshole, period, or I would have devoted my life to supporting an asshole - so, he must actually be good.  Even if he&rsquo;s an asshole.

      <label for="lop70lt" class="commentText"><p>Phil&rsquo;s decision makes sense because IIRC (and I think they show it at the beginning of the clip) Scottie got locked up the possession before that and turned the ball over without even getting a shot up. Of course, Scottie was humiliated that MJ was gone and Phil was going to make him stand there in front of the whole sports world and still defer to somebody else on the last possession. I believe the solution that other superstars employ, if they can&rsquo;t just take the clipboard away and yell &ldquo;absolutely not&rdquo; as Lebron did, is to steal the inbounding pass and take the shot anyway. I guess Phil making Scottie inbound was a chess move to prevent this too.</p>

      <label for="lop8nu7" class="commentText"><p>It’s still wild to me that he didn’t swallow his pride when asked about this moment on the Last Dance. Him saying he’d do it all over again just makes him look like a bitter old man. He could have repaired this to a great extent. It’s kind of a shame that an incredible career and legacy has that kind of stain.</p>

      <label for="lopae35" class="commentText"><p>Obviously he was wrong in how he handled it but strictly strategically speaking I agree with his train of thought. If I’m not mistaken Jackson wanted him to inbound the ball which is really asinine when u consider the other players the had. Scottie actually gave cover for defense’s huge failure of allowing kukoc to catch the pass at the top of the key</p>
