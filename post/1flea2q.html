      <p>Dirk Nowitzki, for example, was viewed quite differently before his championship. He was considered soft and a choker. 2011 completely changed how people viewed him.</p>

<p>I believe James Harden and Russell Westbrook&rsquo;s would be viewed drastically different if they won a championship. They put up amazing regular season numbers. But they never proved that their style of play was good enough to win a championship.</p>

<p>I think currently Joel Embiid would benefit the most from a championship. What do you guys think?</p>

Paul Pierce was a very solid defender, an excellent passer and playmaker, and exceeded his potential by being smart and savvy.  He helped his teams win in a big way.  Melo fell drastically short of his potential because he was lazy on defense, never developed playmaking, and made his teams worse.  He was bigger, stronger, faster, quicker, more athletic, and had more natural skill than Paul Pierce.  One was a pleasant surprise, one was a disappointment.</p>

      <label for="lo2kqj7" class="commentText"><p>I came here to dispute your take, but have to now agree with it. All the ball hogs we now disrespect and retroactively consider to be overrated or at least less great (Melo, AWalker, Westbrook, Harden) do not have rings. Once such ball-dominant players get rings (Bryant, Pierce), their legacy improves. I tried to think of a ball hog all-star with a ring that is still disrespected, and I can&rsquo;t think of any. So yeah, had Melo, Harden, or Westbrook won rings we&rsquo;d probably cease to think of them as inefficient and respect them at the level we respect Nowitzki or Wade.</p>

      <label for="lo2yr7n" class="commentText"><p>This is a bad definition of ball hog, and it ignores the differences in their games.  Kobe was a better passer than Melo, PP was a MUCH better passer than Melo.  Kobe and PP played defense, Melo didn’t.  Antoine Walker was the most like Melo, and he only won a chip as a bench scorer who frankly didn’t have much to do with the success of his team.  Westbrook is an elite passer but his lack of spacing and defense as basketball eras changed blocked his success.</p>

<p>I guess the basic idea is that Melo wasn’t some accidentally disrespected great who just didn’t happen to win.  He was a guy who preferred iso reps and getting his numbers to winning.  He refused to run any kind of offense, he never put in an effort on defense, he didn’t pass.  He was just not a winning player.  Some of the players you listed won chips with worse supporting casts than Melo had.</p>

The titles validated his ball dominant game. Without them, his legacy might be closer to that of Iverson or Westbrook than Curry or Jordan. Lots of guys outside the top 20 have two scoring titles.</p>

Maybe his legacy is like Dominique Wilkens, another 24-25 PPG&hellip;&hellip;.unless you think his defense was that much better though advanced analytics suggest Kobe was a bit overrated defensively. I&rsquo;m not saying Kobe still wouldn&rsquo;t rank ahead of these others, but without rings it&rsquo;s just slightly ahead.</p>

Walker absolutely was empty stats, but PP wasn’t.  As soon as PP had a good supporting cast, he won a championship.  Melo on the other hand had many great supporting casts in Denver and NY.  Then he had a super team at 33 years old but fell off a cliff because he is completely one dimensional.  Melo had the potential to be a top 15-20 all time or maybe even more, he was supposed to be LeBron’s rival.  Instead he was a loser.  PP had none of Melo’s natural gifts but had a better career.</p>

<p>Both players are basically on the same level - superstars, but not MVP-caliber players. Melo would&rsquo;ve won a ring too if he played with Ray Allen &amp; KG.</p>

      <label for="lo4454d" class="commentText"><p>Basketball is a team sport, many great players better than PP have missed the playoffs when their supporting casts were not good enough.  Nobody said he was on the level of AI or Jason Kidd, I don’t know why you’re bringing that up.  We’re talking about Melo, who missed the playoffs plenty with rosters that absolutely had the talent in a historically weak eastern conference.</p>

<p>Sure, PP and Melo are roughly same level, hit that’s the problem.  He is shorter, slower, less athletic and less skilled and yet somehow they were on the same level.  And no, Melo would not have won with older KG and a somewhat washed Ray Allen.  Melo not playing defense and stopping the defense dead to spam bad, long range ISOs does not improve the team, it makes it worse.</p>

      <label for="lo48hfe" class="commentText"><p>Washed?? Ray Allen was in his prime. He was coming off his highest scoring season &amp; still playing huge minutes.</p>

<p>Pierce was a crafty player, he did a good job of making up for his lack of athleticism. Melo wasn&rsquo;t exactly a high-flyer either, but he was a beast in the paint &amp; drew a lot more double teams. Pierce was better at perimeter defense but Melo could guard PF&rsquo;s more effectively &amp; was a better rebounder. They both helped their teams equally imo.</p>

<p>And Melo in his prime led his team to the playoffs every year - and those were average Nuggets teams, nothing special. He only missed the playoffs when he was much older. Pierce missed the playoffs multiple times in his prime, when the East was so weak that sub-.500 teams were making the playoffs most years.</p>

<p>But then I realized whenever I think of great power forwards, Duncan, Garnett, and Nowitzki are the first people to come to mind, even though Malone equally belongs in that group.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I think Malone&rsquo;s name would be in these discussion a lot more if he had won.</p>

      <label for="lo2mclb" class="commentText"><p>I feel like AI gets respect even without a ring. His 2001 losing performance in the spotlight was still better than the highly-touted individuals on the team that beat his team (i.e., AI&rsquo;s play was much better than Kobe and even a little better than Shaq in that series. He only lost becausethe otherteam was better). Meanwhile, KMalone got so outshined by Jordan two (finals) years in a row that people as a result remember Malone as less than he really was as a player.</p>

<p>He won league MVP over Michael Jordan.  If he had also won the championship that year and been the ONLY guy to beat MJ in the finals, he would get way more praise and recognition.</p>

<p>Their last loss in the finals was a one point loss.  If they win that, win one more game, I think his legacy gets a major boost.</p>

<p>Like yes a championship is key in a player’s legacy. But for the sake of personal achievement does it really make a huge difference if someone like AI earned a ring? He was so excellent individually and moreso, changed so much about the game and the culture surrounding basketball. Yes you could definitely argue it, and to witness his finals run would add to his legacy undoubtedly but I’m simply illustrating my point.</p>

<p>Nvm, my answer is Lebron</p>

I rooted so hard for him and the Kings but he always shied away in the clutch. When things got hot, he passed off. It wasn&rsquo;t quite B Simmons level but boy was it noticeable. That was Bibby&rsquo;s team.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, he had all the tools to be one of the goats. But I believe he was missing that certain <em>something</em> that separates the greats from the legends and it was confidence.</p>

      <label for="lo2ayoc" class="commentText"><p>I immediately think 90’s players. Patrick Ewing, Allen Iverson, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Dominique Wilkins, Shawn Kemp, and that’s only a few. There are so many hall of famers who never walked away with a ring it’s actually kinda nutty. Makes sense though with MJ basically running that entire era. Dude was just built different. Never had someone earned 3 titles back to back to back, retired, and then came back to do it all over again. We’ll almost certainly never have another player with Jordan’s tenacity in basketball ever again.</p>

Kinda gets forgotten nowadays, but winning a title (especially with those 7 sec or less Suns) would&rsquo;ve helped with being more, memorable I guess.  Has 2 MVP&rsquo;s and you rarely hear him brought up in casual conversation about the game, plus I think the Nets coaching thing kinda hurt his legacy too.</p>

      <label for="lo3jxqq" class="commentText"><p>Karl Malone. He&rsquo;s still the third all time leading scorer in the NBA and would take a massive effort for KD to push him down a spot. Even putting aside his off court indiscretion he&rsquo;s not held remotely close to that esteem. You don&rsquo;t see him mentioned as a top 10 guy, etc. mostly because the Jazz until the late 90s consistently failed in the playoffs. A championship pushes him up into that conversation.</p>

      <label for="lo430zs" class="commentText"><p>Oscar Robertson as a number 1 option. He&rsquo;s a clear top 15 player all-time imo and was the GOAT playmaker until Magic came along, but because he never won while leading his team he&rsquo;s known as a playoff underperformer (which isn&rsquo;t true) and has become severely underrated by the modern fan. He won a title as the 2nd option at the end of his career, but it came next to arguably peak Kareem on a stacked roster so nobody really cares.</p>
