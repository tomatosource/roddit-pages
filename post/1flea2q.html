      <p>Dirk Nowitzki, for example, was viewed quite differently before his championship. He was considered soft and a choker. 2011 completely changed how people viewed him.</p>

<p>I believe James Harden and Russell Westbrook&rsquo;s would be viewed drastically different if they won a championship. They put up amazing regular season numbers. But they never proved that their style of play was good enough to win a championship.</p>

<p>I think currently Joel Embiid would benefit the most from a championship. What do you guys think?</p>

      <label for="lo2g21j" class="commentText"><p>They’re viewed differently because they’re different solar systems different.  Paul Pierce was a very solid defender, an excellent passer and playmaker, and exceeded his potential by being smart and savvy.  He helped his teams win in a big way.  Melo fell drastically short of his potential because he was lazy on defense, never developed playmaking, and made his teams worse.  He was bigger, stronger, faster, quicker, more athletic, and had more natural skill than Paul Pierce.  One was a pleasant surprise, one was a disappointment.</p>

      <label for="lo2kqj7" class="commentText"><p>I came here to dispute your take, but have to now agree with it. All the ball hogs we now disrespect and retroactively consider to be overrated or at least less great (Melo, AWalker, Westbrook, Harden) do not have rings. Once such ball-dominant players get rings (Bryant, Pierce), their legacy improves. I tried to think of a ball hog all-star with a ring that is still disrespected, and I can&rsquo;t think of any. So yeah, had Melo, Harden, or Westbrook won rings we&rsquo;d probably cease to think of them as inefficient and respect them at the level we respect Nowitzki or Wade.</p>

      <label for="lo2yr7n" class="commentText"><p>This is a bad definition of ball hog, and it ignores the differences in their games.  Kobe was a better passer than Melo, PP was a MUCH better passer than Melo.  Kobe and PP played defense, Melo didn’t.  Antoine Walker was the most like Melo, and he only won a chip as a bench scorer who frankly didn’t have much to do with the success of his team.  Westbrook is an elite passer but his lack of spacing and defense as basketball eras changed blocked his success.</p>

<p>I guess the basic idea is that Melo wasn’t some accidentally disrespected great who just didn’t happen to win.  He was a guy who preferred iso reps and getting his numbers to winning.  He refused to run any kind of offense, he never put in an effort on defense, he didn’t pass.  He was just not a winning player.  Some of the players you listed won chips with worse supporting casts than Melo had.</p>

The titles validated his ball dominant game. Without them, his legacy might be closer to that of Iverson or Westbrook than Curry or Jordan. Lots of guys outside the top 20 have two scoring titles.</p>

Maybe his legacy is like Dominique Wilkens, another 24-25 PPG&hellip;&hellip;.unless you think his defense was that much better though advanced analytics suggest Kobe was a bit overrated defensively. I&rsquo;m not saying Kobe still wouldn&rsquo;t rank ahead of these others, but without rings it&rsquo;s just slightly ahead.</p>

      <label for="lo6d93p" class="commentText"><p>Right.  But was Walker a central piece or was he a wildly inefficient bench player who only played minute because Mourning got hurt and was gifted a ring but everyone immediately forgot about him as soon as he retired?  Paul Pierce won finals MVP, Walker was a one dimensional chucker.</p>

      <label for="lo2w465" class="commentText"><p>Whether PP was viewed as a loser or not is irrelevant.  He was a player who contributed greatly to winning who did not have a good supporting cast.  Walker absolutely was empty stats, but PP wasn’t.  As soon as PP had a good supporting cast, he won a championship.  Melo on the other hand had many great supporting casts in Denver and NY.  Then he had a super team at 33 years old but fell off a cliff because he is completely one dimensional.  Melo had the potential to be a top 15-20 all time or maybe even more, he was supposed to be LeBron’s rival.  Instead he was a loser.  PP had none of Melo’s natural gifts but had a better career.</p>

If he was on the level of, say, Jason Kidd or Iverson, he never would&rsquo;ve missed the playoffs in those years.</p>

<p>Both players are basically on the same level - superstars, but not MVP-caliber players. Melo would&rsquo;ve won a ring too if he played with Ray Allen &amp; KG.</p>

      <label for="lo4454d" class="commentText"><p>Basketball is a team sport, many great players better than PP have missed the playoffs when their supporting casts were not good enough.  Nobody said he was on the level of AI or Jason Kidd, I don’t know why you’re bringing that up.  We’re talking about Melo, who missed the playoffs plenty with rosters that absolutely had the talent in a historically weak eastern conference.</p>

<p>Sure, PP and Melo are roughly same level, hit that’s the problem.  He is shorter, slower, less athletic and less skilled and yet somehow they were on the same level.  And no, Melo would not have won with older KG and a somewhat washed Ray Allen.  Melo not playing defense and stopping the defense dead to spam bad, long range ISOs does not improve the team, it makes it worse.</p>

      <label for="lo48hfe" class="commentText"><p>Washed?? Ray Allen was in his prime. He was coming off his highest scoring season &amp; still playing huge minutes.</p>

<p>Pierce was a crafty player, he did a good job of making up for his lack of athleticism. Melo wasn&rsquo;t exactly a high-flyer either, but he was a beast in the paint &amp; drew a lot more double teams. Pierce was better at perimeter defense but Melo could guard PF&rsquo;s more effectively &amp; was a better rebounder. They both helped their teams equally imo.</p>

<p>And Melo in his prime led his team to the playoffs every year - and those were average Nuggets teams, nothing special. He only missed the playoffs when he was much older. Pierce missed the playoffs multiple times in his prime, when the East was so weak that sub-.500 teams were making the playoffs most years.</p>

      <label for="lo4keg3" class="commentText"><p>Ray Allen was 32 when he started playing for the Celtics and the only reason he scored that much the season before is because he had to, his team was trash.  He nuked his efficiency to score that much, and his defense was significantly worse.  Taking a smaller role on Boston extended his career.</p>

<p>Some of these things you’re saying are only true if you don’t look at context.  Was Melo a better rebounder?  No, not really, he just didn’t defend out at the perimeter as much, being both lazy defensively and spending a lot of his career at the PF slot closer to the rim.  He had higher rebounding numbers due to circumstance, not a particular skill, though he did like that it gave him the ball.  Was Melo more effective guarding 4’s?  Kinda, he was bigger, and provided more physical resistance to the rim just by being there.  But if there was a 4 who could stretch the floor or was quick with his dribble, Melo was cooked.  Not that he couldn’t, Melo actually played some of the best defense anyone ever had on LeBron.  It was, again, laziness.</p>

<p>Also, in point of fact, Melo definitely missed the playoffs at 29 years old in the heart of his prime, not when he was “much older”.  It’s also not a feather in his cap that he got smoked in the first round 11 out of his 13 playoff appearances.  In fact that’s seriously embarrassing, and he had good supporting casts to the point where some of those exits he wasn’t even the best player.  The man had one good playoff run in 2009 and everything else was an underwhelming mess of him trying to be Kobe without passing or playing defense.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lo5u6ov" class="commentText"><p>The perception is one thing, but the reality is you can just look at their stats and tell they are different.  </p>

<p>PP was more efficient in TS%, had more assists and a better assist percentage, shot and made more threes, turned the ball over less.  </p>

<p>He was also considered a plus defender throughout his career as others have said, whereas Melo was considered a low value defender.</p>

<p>The players that are really frowned upon - and this really came to a head during Melo&rsquo;s prime - are players who did a lot of iso plays and settled for long twos, and weren&rsquo;t good at anything else but scoring, and weren&rsquo;t particularly good as a spot up 3pt threat or willing to play that role.  </p>

<p>Iverson is another example of someone who has taken a big hit over the years as general understanding of what it takes to win has evolved.  Several contemporaries of Melos who were less talented but had similar shortcomings saw their value crater in real time in the early 2010s when analytics really started taking over - Rudy Gay and Monta Ellis for example.</p>

<p>Basically what I am trying to highlight are players who, to one degree or another, are missing all the things that make it easy to fit them into a great team: outside shooting, offball ability (movement shooting and cutting), defense, playmaking, and hustle plays.</p>

<p>Someone like Melo whose best ability is to offer high resiliency shots when the offense stalls late in the shot clock is just not worth it if they don&rsquo;t do the other things well and they insist on being high volume with suboptimal shot selection (and cost a lot).</p>

<p>Players like Kobe at times might have played too much iso ball and shot too many bad shots too, but he also contributed at a high level in pretty much every other area.  He was a great defender especially early in his career, and a great playmaker especially in the latter part.  And he was slightly more efficient despite playing in a lower efficiency era, played off the ball better with more activity and higher gravity, and was known to be a smarter player and kind of a coach on the floor.</p>

<p>Sometimes the reason a player never wins a championship is because his game is not conducive to it, and honestly I thought that about Melo before he was drafted, that this was a player who would score a lot of points and had one of the lowest chances of winning a championship of any player I&rsquo;d ever seen</p>

      <label for="lo5uzdo" class="commentText"><p>Yeah while I think Kobe could be an awful, inefficient chucker at times, he never gave less than 100% effort on defense, and if he had good players around him he could be cajoled into giving up some of his shots in service of winning games. The guys he gave the shots to just had to be as good as Shaq or Pau Gasol. Melo was never giving his shots up and never giving any effort on the defensive end.</p>

His 2001 losing performance in the spotlight was still better than the highly-touted individuals on the team that beat his team (i.e., AI&rsquo;s play was much better than Kobe and even a little better than Shaq in that series. He only lost becausethe otherteam was better). Meanwhile, KMalone got so outshined by Jordan two (finals) years in a row that people as a result remember Malone as less than he really was as a player.</p>

<p>Like yes a championship is key in a player’s legacy. But for the sake of personal achievement does it really make a huge difference if someone like AI earned a ring? He was so excellent individually and moreso, changed so much about the game and the culture surrounding basketball. Yes you could definitely argue it, and to witness his finals run would add to his legacy undoubtedly but I’m simply illustrating my point.</p>

<p>Nvm, my answer is Lebron</p>

I rooted so hard for him and the Kings but he always shied away in the clutch. When things got hot, he passed off. It wasn&rsquo;t quite B Simmons level but boy was it noticeable. That was Bibby&rsquo;s team.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, he had all the tools to be one of the goats. But I believe he was missing that certain <em>something</em> that separates the greats from the legends and it was confidence.</p>

There are so many hall of famers who never walked away with a ring it’s actually kinda nutty. Makes sense though with MJ basically running that entire era. Dude was just built different. Never had someone earned 3 titles back to back to back, retired, and then came back to do it all over again. We’ll almost certainly never have another player with Jordan’s tenacity in basketball ever again.</p>

      <label for="lo3zark" class="commentText"><p>The main problem from the hit was the league suspending all the Suns players for the next game for stepping on the court to defend Nash. Feelings from the Malice at the Palace were still raw so they were still extremely harsh in trying to discourage any in game fighting which resulted in stupid suspensions without considering contexts. Fuck David Stern!</p>

Kinda gets forgotten nowadays, but winning a title (especially with those 7 sec or less Suns) would&rsquo;ve helped with being more, memorable I guess.

He&rsquo;s a clear top 15 player all-time imo and was the GOAT playmaker until Magic came along, but because he never won while leading his team he&rsquo;s known as a playoff underperformer (which isn&rsquo;t true) and has become severely underrated by the modern fan. He won a title as the 2nd option at the end of his career, but it came next to arguably peak Kareem on a stacked roster so nobody really cares.</p>

      <label for="lo52yu3" class="commentText"><p>Am assuming it’s only the NBA championship we’re talking about and I’ll limit my response to players who 1) I watched since I discovered basketball, and 2) aren’t playing anymore.</p>

<p>Barkley, Ewing, Reggie Miller, Malone &amp; Stockton - all got beat by the 90s Bulls.</p>

<p>And then in the 00s there’s Iverson whose 76ers couldn’t top the Lakers and Yao who couldn’t top injuries.</p>

      <label for="lo60aap" class="commentText"><p>Stockton. Even though I don&rsquo;t think rings should define any player at all, it&rsquo;d make him look much better in the general opinion&rsquo;s eyes. All-time leader by a long shot in two categories with a ring? Really impressive.</p>
