It used to be there&rsquo;s be a couple of good players on every team who seemed effective against our NBA talent but then everyone else was janitor level. Everyone down the bench can play now. There&rsquo;s only 300 ish guys in the NBA but there are a lot more players in the world these days that would be in the NBA if the cards drew there way, lots of guys on the fringe.</p>

<p>The chance now of facing a team and teams with multiple NBA players is way higher now for someone like the U.S.. This doesn&rsquo;t say much about their talent and peak of these players though. There barely will be a player like Gianni&rsquo;s, Luka, Jokic on a team. Let alone more of their caliber.</p>

      <label for="lhqebtq" class="commentText"><p>While true, after group play the US has to win 3 consecutive games against the top of the field. Those games will be against those great players. Great individual play can carry a bad team to a win over a good one on any random night in the NBA regular season. Since it is single elimination, it is entirely possible the US catches a Luka, SGA, Giannis, Wemby, or Jokic going off enough to beat them.</p>

      <label for="lhqo1uc" class="commentText"><p>The nature of 3pt game also often make team with players with decent 3pt can go hot from there and gave some troubles. Look at Serbia. They got crushed twice by US, but in Semi they went nuclear from 3pt and led by two digits before Jokic got into foul troubles. Same with South Sudan. We even saw Puerto Rico went hot for a quarter.</p>

<p>US would crush nearly all countries easily, but several players on opposite side shot far better than their norm that lasted for at least two quarters would give significant troubles.</p>

      <label for="lhqq3ia" class="commentText"><p>It’s not just this, it’s that the next generation of top talent is disproportionately international. <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2024/08/11/best-nba-players-in-the-olympics-by-country-since-the-1992-dream-team/" target="_blank">By VORP</a>, none of those 23 international players in 1992 were top 20. In 2024, the top 4 players by VORP play for non-US squads. Joel Embiid at fifth is the best-rated US player by VORP, and he might not even have played for the US if Cameroon had made it. This is before you even get to the fact that the international leagues are also not nearly as far behind the NBA as they used to be.</p>

<p>Obviously VORP is not perfect but the trend is obvious even just from the eye test. U.S. is going to have a much harder time winning gold in the next few Olympics. Their best chance is that the top international players are all from different countries.</p>

<p>In overall talent, the US will probably remain the best, but after group play it only takes one loss. We almost saw it vs Serbia five days ago.</p>

      <label for="lhql249" class="commentText"><p>The world was absolutely gaining. But on the other hand, the lineup USA sent abroad that year was particularly egregious. It wasn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> as mediocre as the team we sent over in &lsquo;88 (when USA took bronze) but it also wasn&rsquo;t altogether dissimilar either, especially when considering LBJ, Melo, and Amar&rsquo;e were basically unutilized.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny to look back at that &lsquo;88 team now. They were all college players, but they were also all 22 or 23 years old (the same age as Anthony Edwards). David Robinson, Danny Manning, Dan Majerle, Hersey Hawkins, and Mitch Richmond were all future all-stars (a couple were future Hall of Famers) but it became apparent that wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it anymore by &lsquo;88. In turn, leaning heavily on Lamar Odom and Richard Jefferson certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it in &lsquo;04.</p>

<p>All of that is my wordy way of saying that if we&rsquo;d sent our &lsquo;92 Dream Team equivalent of stars in 2004, I think USA still cuts through the field like butter. Here&rsquo;s who we left behind that year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal</li>
<li>Kobe Bryant</li>
<li>Vince Carter</li>
<li>Tracy McGrady</li>
<li>Jason Kidd</li>
<li>Baron Davis</li>
<li>Kevin Garnett</li>
<li>Steve Francis</li>

      <label for="lhqowpu" class="commentText"><p>The US is still going to be more talented overall for a long time.  The issue is a lack of chemistry and different ruleset. They are going to need to be more picky about the selection process and pick players that will work together better as a team as opposed to just sending all the best players regardless of fit. </p>

      <label for="lhqkfsy" class="commentText"><p>The long-term commitment is building tho it seems. Ability and career paths can take unforeseen turns (early declines, career-altering injuries, etc.) but we have a good group of 5 guys already on this 2024 team that should be around for the next two Olympics and another 3 that should be good for at least 2028.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Might be a hot take but I see KD, Embiid, and White all around for the 2028 Olympics. (Embiid seems least likely)</p></li>

<li><p>Book, Tatum, and Bam have all played in 2 Olympics already and should be able to play in 2028 AND even 2032.</p></li>

<li><p>Hali and Ant just played in their 1st and will hopefully be around for 2028, 2032, and even 2036.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s not even mentioning the young guys that could be elite players by 2028 and posed to start what will hopefully be a long-term commitment: Chet, Paolo, Flagg, Maxey, Ja, JDub, etc.</p>

<p>Having 8 returning guys on the 2028 team is pretty solid, hopefully with at least a few of the youngins ready to start their international careers (and a few really good players that have missed the cut so far like Brunson, JayBrown, Mikal, etc.)</p>

Feel like that Croatia team doesn’t get enough love for how talented they were</p>

      <label for="lhq3eti" class="commentText"><p>That 90s Croatia was really talented, but never won anything other than Bronze and Silver. Even in tournaments without the US. Petrovic dying in 93 was basically the end for that team.</p>

<p>And they had talented players, but Petrovic was the only player that was actually elite at his position. Kukoc was a great roleplayer. Radja was in the NBA for 4 years and then was injured.</p>

<p>Compare that to the current Serbia team with a top 15 all-time player, one of the best roleplayers in Bogdan (when healthy, which is rare nowadays) and the rest of team is filled with Euro league MVPs and elite shooters. Very different levels.</p>

Playing at such a high level against a lineup filled with NBA MVPs has to do wonders for confidence and developing an elite mentality of knowing what’s required to compete against the best in the world.</p>

<p>Like LeBron and others after playing with Kobe in 08, except as opponents instead of teammates.</p>

      <label for="lhq4uh7" class="commentText"><p>I think more than the talent, the strategy of the rest of the world is catching up that US can no longer simply rely on their overwhelming talent. Argentina showed it in 2004, teamwork can beat raw talent.</p>

<p>I think USA can still dominate right now if the game is played the same way as in the 90s. But basketball evolved so much over the last 20-30 years, that the rest of the world can use modern strategies to neutralize the USAs talent advantage.</p>

<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a two-fold attack which is really closing the gap. More international players are simple more skilled (but that simply isn&rsquo;t enough). You also have the modern basketball strategies that really allows non-USA teams to compete.</p>

<p>2028 is really gonna be interesting.</p>

      <label for="lhqnos4" class="commentText"><p>I think a lot of it comes from people oversimplifying things a bit, concluding that the NBA is the pinnacle of basketball, so Team USA being comprised entirely of superstars from the world&rsquo;s best league should be able to overwhelm the bulk of their opponents.</p>

<p>The games, of course, aren&rsquo;t won on paper, and there&rsquo;s so much more to basketball than taking 12 stars, throwing them onto the floor, and hoping for the best. To some degree, it&rsquo;s the same reason why super teams in the NBA don&rsquo;t always work.</p>

<p>Then again, while acknowledging how good Nikola Jokic and Bogdan Bogdanovic  may be, should they really be able to run up an 18-point lead (or whatever it may have been) on a team as loaded as Team USA? Perhaps not. And we kind of caught glimpses of that when USA flexed and began to run on all cylinders. I think some folks are just out there thinking, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t the USA be running on all cylinders more frequently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like, I can acknowledge that South Sudan has some hoopers, but is there any planet in which they should have come within one layup of taking down USA, even in an exhibition?</p>

<p>Perhaps the lesson is that Team USA is likely still the most skilled team in the world, but it&rsquo;s just become more dangerous to underperform.</p>

      <label for="lhqga39" class="commentText"><p>Yes but you are still seeing this purely in terms of talent. Yes Hali would probably be 2nd or 3rd best in most teams but without team chemistry and strategy, talent can only get you so far. That’s where other countries are catching up. In team sports especially in a single elimination setting, anything can happen even if one side is supremely talented. Basketball, when it’s all said and done is a game of runs. Infact as you said even if Team World was formed today with a month worth of buildup, there is no guarantee that they will every single elimination style tournament.</p>

You had a 3x MVP on Serbia, a perennial MVP candidate on Canada &amp; a 4x DPOY on France. If you just look at the roster for real lottery teams like the Trail Blazers or Wizards there&rsquo;s no comparison.</p>

      <label for="lhqlsfm" class="commentText"><p>I think its pretty obvious to see you cant just assemble a team of the best players in each position and they&rsquo;ll dominate. How well the team plays together is really important combine that with shooting variance and rise of the 3pt shots. If you have 2 guys that are decent and a good game plan then other guys who can just play passable defense you can beat someone in one game. Sometimes less is actually more on offense. Like they can&rsquo;t guard the 2man game already and you add 3 other dudes that want the ball it makes you worse at offense. Steph plus someone in the pick and roll is probably the highest point per possession. If you add anything but stellar 3pt shooters waiting for a kick it makes it worse bc then the defense can help on the pick and roll.</p>

<p>Single elimination basketball tournaments are really hard to win. We see it in ncaa every year. A team of top draft prospects loses to 5 dudes that are no where near nba talent.</p>

Can’t be tossing the C team out there one year for the FIBA World Cup, then have a new team put together the next year, and expect to stroll through these other nations.</p>

<p>Let’s paint the picture…</p>

<p>The Celtics win multiple championships over the next few years. Tatum and Brown are the top American players in 2028 by a mile.</p>

<p>Sure, new players like Cooper could be good early and Booker and Edwards are still around but let’s pretend the pecking order is that clear.</p>

<p>These two guys aren’t gonna answer the call for anything but the Olympics. They presumably have had 4 long NBA seasons going to the finals each year.</p>

<p>Did USA Basketball burn some bridges? These two guys are gonna have a ton of leverage.</p>

<p>Not having two NBA first team’rs on the 28 squad could very well mean the difference between Gold and not medaling.</p>

<p>Now… if it’s the NBA and a star says he will play but wants a coaching change or even a front office change… it’s very possible that happens. Does that kinda thing fly in USAB? Behind close doors, do they say no to Kerr and Grant Hill?</p>

<p>I don’t have a problem with rotations or leaving a guy off in favor of glue guys but I do think USA hoops disrespected them in how it happened and it was a bad look… especially because they are the future and are working on their brand as well as their game.</p>

      <label for="lhpzde1" class="commentText"><p>92, 96, and 12 would trade all day every day. Nothing more to say. Each team has a great bench and a stack of MVPs or MVPs to be. Different era&rsquo;s, rules, and of course fouls would change each game.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get much better than Jordan, Robinson, Pippen, Barkley, Magic crew no matter what you do to the game. All of these people can play amazing defense when needed man on man or zone or whatever the fuck you want them to play. I think most people think it&rsquo;s not possible to just play man to man with teams like this. When you have premier defenders, you can easily pull that off.</p>

<p>The 12 crew has some insane guys, and I&rsquo;d take them over the 08 crew who lacks any kind of bench to compete with 92 or 96. Durant in his prime or close is the one that changes the game. He made a record amount of threes in 12, and it would be hard to stop him. But if anybody could it would be some of the defenders from 92 or 96 for sure.</p>

<p>All of the main 92 dudes shot over 50% in their primes or better. All the theoretical starters dominated and many were MVPs in fact you can do a whole starting 5 with guys who would reach that pinnacle. Pippen was also very close to an MVP and is decidedly the best perimeter defense in league history or very close. His peak is in basically 91 in fact, so was Jordan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>And you have Mullin, Bird, and Stockton for threes if you want that kind of approach. Bird is not in his prime, but if he was it would be no contest. Furthermore, you don&rsquo;t need any of the white boys here. Man to man defense all game would be stifling against a 92 team. You would not necessarily even have to play zone much with that kind of talent. Why would you NOT use that talent for man to man lol? There is not much reason to use zone all game with people as talented as that.</p>

<p>The only team possibly beating this team in a 7 series IMO is the one is 96, who matches up extremely well, or the 12 team with a nutter Durant and Lebron along with a bunch of young MVPs to be.</p>

<p>What I really don&rsquo;t get is that people think threes are so hard for prime NBA shooters. You got kids coming in off the street shooting threes well, but they are garbage players for a reason. Past era&rsquo;s just didn&rsquo;t practice them much. Nothing has changed in how talented these people are. I don&rsquo;t think most of you understand how well all these people can shoot the ball, nor have you ever seen any of these people play.</p>

<p>For me 92 and 96 could really go at each other, but prime Jordan and Barkley along with prime Robinson would be incredibly hard to stop on the 92 team. Shaq is the focus on the 96 team of course, and they have some carryovers from 92. Just depends who is getting the foul calls really.</p>

<p>Like what are we even doing lol? These teams have the same players just older matching up against each other. FANTASY.</p>

<p>08 has some incredible players on the starting 5 who could give anybody a run for their money too. But they also lack depth IMO.</p>

<p>I mean on 08 Bosh is the rebound leader. Bosh is not as good as prime Barkley or any of the centers lol. Howard is good for sure, but he&rsquo;s still not as good as prime Robinson nor even close to Shaq. That&rsquo;s a major problem for those teams.</p>

<p>We aren&rsquo;t even gonna discuss how you handle prime Jordan lol. 08 does have a really great Lebron and Kobe, but I don&rsquo;t see this team beating up 92 at all&hellip; weak ass bench if you ask me.</p>

<p>For sure tho if somehow every player were in their prime or close on THIS current team they would match up against most teams, though, they are a little weak on the inside.</p>

<p>For me 92, 96, and 12 would trade all day every day. 08 to ME is slightly lesser I really don&rsquo;t like their bench.</p>
