      <label for="lhpyj4i" class="commentText"><p>Obviously the field is way better than 1992 but I was looking up the box score of past gold medal games after yesterdays game and that 1992 Croatia team had an awesome big 3 of Drazen Petrovic, Toni Kukoc and Dino Radja (all had great success in the NBA) and the dream team still destroyed them in the gold medal game.  Feel like that Croatia team doesn’t get enough love for how talented they were</p>

      <label for="lhq3eti" class="commentText"><p>That 90s Croatia was really talented, but never won anything other than Bronze and Silver. Even in tournaments without the US. Petrovic dying in 93 was basically the end for that team.</p>

<p>And they had talented players, but Petrovic was the only player that was actually elite at his position. Kukoc was a great roleplayer. Radja was in the NBA for 4 years and then was injured.</p>

<p>Compare that to the current Serbia team with a top 15 all-time player, one of the best roleplayers in Bogdan (when healthy, which is rare nowadays) and the rest of team is filled with Euro league MVPs and elite shooters. Very different levels.</p>

      <label for="lhq4uh7" class="commentText"><p>I think more than the talent, the strategy of the rest of the world is catching up that US can no longer simply rely on their overwhelming talent. Argentina showed it in 2004, teamwork can beat raw talent.</p>

<p>I think USA can still dominate right now if the game is played the same way as in the 90s. But basketball evolved so much over the last 20-30 years, that the rest of the world can use modern strategies to neutralize the USAs talent advantage.</p>

<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a two-fold attack which is really closing the gap. More international players are simple more skilled (but that simply isn&rsquo;t enough). You also have the modern basketball strategies that really allows non-USA teams to compete.</p>

<p>2028 is really gonna be interesting.</p>

<p>The chance now of facing a team and teams with multiple NBA players is way higher now for someone like the U.S.. This doesn&rsquo;t say much about their talent and peak of these players though. There barely will be a player like Gianni&rsquo;s, Luka, Jokic on a team. Let alone more of their caliber.</p>

<p>People need to realize that benching of Jayson Tatum is not just for controversy. They legit thought he was not playable against Serbia. That is just how good the competition was. That is just how good the team was.</p>

      <label for="lhpzde1" class="commentText"><p>92, 96, and 12 would trade all day every day. Nothing more to say. Each team has a great bench and a stack of MVPs or MVPs to be. Different era&rsquo;s, rules, and of course fouls would change each game.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get much better than Jordan, Robinson, Pippen, Barkley, Magic crew no matter what you do to the game. All of these people can play amazing defense when needed man on man or zone or whatever the fuck you want them to play. I think most people think it&rsquo;s not possible to just play man to man with teams like this. When you have premier defenders, you can easily pull that off.</p>

<p>The 12 crew has some insane guys, and I&rsquo;d take them over the 08 crew who lacks any kind of bench to compete with 92 or 96. Durant in his prime or close is the one that changes the game. He made a record amount of threes in 12, and it would be hard to stop him. But if anybody could it would be some of the defenders from 92 or 96 for sure.</p>

<p>All of the main 92 dudes shot over 50% in their primes or better. All the theoretical starters dominated and many were MVPs in fact you can do a whole starting 5 with guys who would reach that pinnacle. Pippen was also very close to an MVP and is decidedly the best perimeter defense in league history or very close. His peak is in basically 91 in fact, so was Jordan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>And you have Mullin, Bird, and Stockton for threes if you want that kind of approach. Bird is not in his prime, but if he was it would be no contest. Furthermore, you don&rsquo;t need any of the white boys here. Man to man defense all game would be stifling against a 92 team. You would not necessarily even have to play zone much with that kind of talent. Why would you NOT use that talent for man to man lol? There is not much reason to use zone all game with people as talented as that.</p>

<p>The only team possibly beating this team in a 7 series IMO is the one is 96, who matches up extremely well, or the 12 team with a nutter Durant and Lebron along with a bunch of young MVPs to be.</p>

<p>What I really don&rsquo;t get is that people think threes are so hard for prime NBA shooters. You got kids coming in off the street shooting threes well, but they are garbage players for a reason. Past era&rsquo;s just didn&rsquo;t practice them much. Nothing has changed in how talented these people are. I don&rsquo;t think most of you understand how well all these people can shoot the ball, nor have you ever seen any of these people play.</p>

<p>For me 92 and 96 could really go at each other, but prime Jordan and Barkley along with prime Robinson would be incredibly hard to stop on the 92 team. Shaq is the focus on the 96 team of course, and they have some carryovers from 92. Just depends who is getting the foul calls really.</p>

<p>Like what are we even doing lol? These teams have the same players just older matching up against each other. FANTASY.</p>

<p>08 has some incredible players on the starting 5 who could give anybody a run for their money too. But they also lack depth IMO.</p>

<p>I mean on 08 Bosh is the rebound leader. Bosh is not as good as prime Barkley or any of the centers lol. Howard is good for sure, but he&rsquo;s still not as good as prime Robinson nor even close to Shaq. That&rsquo;s a major problem for those teams.</p>

<p>We aren&rsquo;t even gonna discuss how you handle prime Jordan lol. 08 does have a really great Lebron and Kobe, but I don&rsquo;t see this team beating up 92 at all&hellip; weak ass bench if you ask me.</p>

<p>For sure tho if somehow every player were in their prime or close on THIS current team they would match up against most teams, though, they are a little weak on the inside.</p>

<p>For me 92, 96, and 12 would trade all day every day. 08 to ME is slightly lesser I really don&rsquo;t like their bench.</p>
