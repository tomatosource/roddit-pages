It used to be there&rsquo;s be a couple of good players on every team who seemed effective against our NBA talent but then everyone else was janitor level. Everyone down the bench can play now. There&rsquo;s only 300 ish guys in the NBA but there are a lot more players in the world these days that would be in the NBA if the cards drew there way, lots of guys on the fringe.</p>

      <label for="lhqq3ia" class="commentText"><p>It’s not just this, it’s that the next generation of top talent is disproportionately international. <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2024/08/11/best-nba-players-in-the-olympics-by-country-since-the-1992-dream-team/" target="_blank">By VORP</a>, none of those 23 international players in 1992 were top 20. In 2024, the top 4 players by VORP play for non-US squads. Joel Embiid at fifth is the best-rated US player by VORP, and he might not even have played for the US if Cameroon had made it. This is before you even get to the fact that the international leagues are also not nearly as far behind the NBA as they used to be.</p>

<p>Obviously VORP is not perfect but the trend is obvious even just from the eye test. U.S. is going to have a much harder time winning gold in the next few Olympics. Their best chance is that the top international players are all from different countries.</p>

<p>In overall talent, the US will probably remain the best, but after group play it only takes one loss. We almost saw it vs Serbia five days ago.</p>

<p>The chance now of facing a team and teams with multiple NBA players is way higher now for someone like the U.S.. This doesn&rsquo;t say much about their talent and peak of these players though. There barely will be a player like Gianni&rsquo;s, Luka, Jokic on a team. Let alone more of their caliber.</p>

      <label for="lhqebtq" class="commentText"><p>While true, after group play the US has to win 3 consecutive games against the top of the field. Those games will be against those great players. Great individual play can carry a bad team to a win over a good one on any random night in the NBA regular season. Since it is single elimination, it is entirely possible the US catches a Luka, SGA, Giannis, Wemby, or Jokic going off enough to beat them.</p>

They got crushed twice by US, but in Semi they went nuclear from 3pt and led by two digits before Jokic got into foul troubles. Same with South Sudan. We even saw Puerto Rico went hot for a quarter.</p>

<p>US would crush nearly all countries easily, but several players on opposite side shot far better than their norm that lasted for at least two quarters would give significant troubles.</p>

Jokic, Giannis, and Luka are basically on track to be top 30 of all time, along Embiid (easy top 30 potential with health), Sabonis, Wemby, Sengun, Lauri, etc. We have a USA vs. the World game now. The quality of international play is insane and honestly kind of more entertaining from a pure basketball standpoint too.</p>

      <label for="lhs45nm" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s definitely behind soccer by an extremely large margin, but I don&rsquo;t think the rest of the list is accurate. I think tennis is probably number 2, it&rsquo;s the second sport with the most players and a lot of people watch it, the French Open in particular is on the free TV channels and a ton of people watch it every year.</p>

<p>Basketball has decisively more practitioners than Rugby or Handball, but the issue is that the French league is not popular at all, and the NBA while quite popular is obviously very hard to follow due to games being at night. So most people only have a passing interest in it as far as a spectator sport goes, mainly watching NBA highlights on Instagram and Youtube. I think it&rsquo;s growing more rapidly than any other sport though, I see NBA jerseys all the time in Paris and I have a lot of friends who are pretty hardcore fans like me (obviously slightly biased since being a fan is a surefire way to become my friend in the first place 😄). I also live in Paris where it&rsquo;s probably more popular than anywhere else in the country. Paris being in the Euroleague next season should probably help with its popularity even more (their head of basketball operations is the infamous David Kahn, who has done an absolutely tremendous job)</p>

<p>Rugby has a lot more people watching (the French league is largely considered the best in the world), but it has half of the players that basketball has. It&rsquo;s also highly regional, extremely popular in the south-west of France, but not nearly as much in the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Handball is quite popular due to France being dominant for several decades at the international level, but the actual leagues aren&rsquo;t followed that much at all.</p>

<p>The other one is Judo which a ton of people practice (more than any sport other than Soccer or Tennis), but isn&rsquo;t watched much at all outside of the Olympics.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say Tennis/Rugby/Basketball are neck-and-neck for the second spot, depending on location, social status, and whether you put more weight into people actually playing the sport or watching it.</p>

<p>Nope, HS Football just released next year&rsquo;s classifications and they just added 6A Football&hellip;the sports radio broadcast was packed with phone calls and people were talking trash about HIGH SCHOOL coaches, I mean they knew coordinators names. It was insane!</p>

<p>Dallas is a major metroplex. I cant imagine some of these other places in West or East TX where its just these medium size towns but there is no real forms if entertainment.</p>

      <label for="lhql249" class="commentText"><p>The world was absolutely gaining. But on the other hand, the lineup USA sent abroad that year was particularly egregious. It wasn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> as mediocre as the team we sent over in &lsquo;88 (when USA took bronze) but it also wasn&rsquo;t altogether dissimilar either, especially when considering LBJ, Melo, and Amar&rsquo;e were basically unutilized.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny to look back at that &lsquo;88 team now. They were all college players, but they were also all 22 or 23 years old (the same age as Anthony Edwards). David Robinson, Danny Manning, Dan Majerle, Hersey Hawkins, and Mitch Richmond were all future all-stars (a couple were future Hall of Famers) but it became apparent that wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it anymore by &lsquo;88. In turn, leaning heavily on Lamar Odom and Richard Jefferson certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it in &lsquo;04.</p>

<p>All of that is my wordy way of saying that if we&rsquo;d sent our &lsquo;92 Dream Team equivalent of stars in 2004, I think USA still cuts through the field like butter. Here&rsquo;s who we left behind that year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal</li>
<li>Kobe Bryant</li>
<li>Vince Carter</li>
<li>Tracy McGrady</li>
<li>Jason Kidd</li>
<li>Baron Davis</li>
<li>Kevin Garnett</li>
<li>Steve Francis</li>
<li>Ray Allen</li>
<li>Jermaine O&rsquo;Neal</li>
<li>Paul Pierce</li>
<li>Michael Redd</li>
<li>Kenyon Martin</li>
<li>Ron Artest</li>
<li>Chris Webber</li>

<p>We&rsquo;re just not as interested in international competitions as a lot of other countries are and that&rsquo;s OK.  We&rsquo;re a big country, we dominate the sports we care about, and the highest leagues in those sports are all in the United States.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s different internationally.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just no American equivalent of the UEFA Champions League in the United States.  We just don&rsquo;t have the same culture around the World Cup, World Baseball Classic, or even the Olympics.  Our best athletes frequently sit those out and, as fans, we rarely tune in.</p>

      <label for="lhr4ycy" class="commentText"><p>The gap between an NBA star in a lead position and a bad NBA player in a lead position is huge. But when the star&rsquo;s role in the line up gets cut down to a 3 and D guy because there are 5 guys on the team better than you, the gap of what the star brings gets a lot smaller. And the non-NBA guys on the international teams are now pretty good too, so the floor of a team like France or Germany isn&rsquo;t nearly as low as it used to be. Plus, the shorter 3pt line and the shorter game up the variability. Becomes a lot easier for one team to get hot for a bit when the game is almost 20% shorter.</p>

Like Nando de Colo came off the bench and gave 12 points but the reason he&rsquo;s not close to the NBA is because he would get cooked every single possession.</p>

<p>Also the NBA game has a bigger court, is a lot faster and less physical. In the NBA it&rsquo;s easier to hunt match ups because of the bigger court, but in FIBA it seems easier to help.</p>

      <label for="lhqsbn0" class="commentText"><p>Exactly this. The US will continue to be the only country that can make a 12 man roster out of only high level NBA players. A handful of teams will have their best player be someone better than ours, but not much more than that.</p>

<p>Chemistry and fit are becoming important for the US but Team USA seems to realize that (picking White over Brown). Definitely need to teach the FIBA rules better, the live ball once it hits the rim especially. We lost out on a lot of rebounds, a good number of easy putbacks and gave up buckets that could have swatted off the rim because our players weren’t used to it.</p>

<p>Also, probably need to start getting guys together and practicing more, but that’s going to be hard to do with the NBA schedule.</p>

      <label for="lhrireq" class="commentText"><p>Everyone makes this argument as though this isn&rsquo;t the case for every other country&hellip; Jokic has one, maybe two more Olympics in his career and Serbia may never produce another Jokic in their history. Wemby will be a superstar for France for a few Olympics but it remains to be seen whether his supporting cast will be enough.</p>

<p>The one thing we know for sure is that, unless they decide to stop taking it as seriously (e.g., the Covid Olympics), the USA is able to send 12 NBA all-stars every 4 years. The USA is the only country that can say that.</p>

<p>Yes, the USA would be the only country that&rsquo;s in contention for gold every 4 years. Serbia would probably fall off after Jokic, Slovenia after Luka, etc. But there&rsquo;s very good chance that there will always be <strong>someone</strong>, not necessarily the same one, who would have a very legitmate shot at the gold every 4 years. This year it was Serbia, maybe in 2028 it would be France, after that someone else.</p>

<p>Yeah, the contest will (for the foreseeable future) be USA vs a rotating someone, but that&rsquo;s still very far from the previous days of &ldquo;USA vs its unwillingness to send notable players to the Olympics&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lhqkfsy" class="commentText"><p>The long-term commitment is building tho it seems. Ability and career paths can take unforeseen turns (early declines, career-altering injuries, etc.) but we have a good group of 5 guys already on this 2024 team that should be around for the next two Olympics and another 4 that should be good for at least 2028.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Might be a hot take but I see KD, Embiid, and White all around for the 2028 Olympics (Embiid seems least likely). Another commenter noted AD plans on being there as well.</p></li>

<li><p>Book, Tatum, and Bam have all played in 2 Olympics already and should be able to play in 2028 AND even 2032.</p></li>

<li><p>Hali and Ant just played in their 1st and will hopefully be around for 2028, 2032, and even 2036.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s not even mentioning the young guys that could be elite players by 2028 and posed to start what will hopefully be a long-term commitment: Chet, Paolo, Flagg, Maxey, Ja, JDub, etc.</p>

<p>Having 9 returning guys on the 2028 team is pretty solid, hopefully with at least a few of the youngins ready to start their international careers (and a few really good players that have missed the cut so far like Brunson, JayBrown, Mikal, etc.)</p>

<p>And they had talented players, but Petrovic was the only player that was actually elite at his position. Kukoc was a great roleplayer. Radja was in the NBA for 4 years and then was injured.</p>

<p>Compare that to the current Serbia team with a top 15 all-time player, one of the best roleplayers in Bogdan (when healthy, which is rare nowadays) and the rest of team is filled with Euro league MVPs and elite shooters. Very different levels.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Silver was maximum you could reach 1992, having Dream Team in sight.
Next summer, before Euro 1993, Drazen died. Everything went downhill from then: from being unhappy with winning &ldquo;only bronze&rdquo; to hitting rock bottom and losing to San Marino.</p>

<p>I would argue that Kukoc was also really good, maybe not elite NBA player. But he spent his prime being 6th man at bulls, and playing many minutes under the basket, as SF position was covered with Scottie, obviously.</p>

      <label for="lhq4uh7" class="commentText"><p>I think more than the talent, the strategy of the rest of the world is catching up that US can no longer simply rely on their overwhelming talent. Argentina showed it in 2004, teamwork can beat raw talent.</p>

<p>I think USA can still dominate right now if the game is played the same way as in the 90s. But basketball evolved so much over the last 20-30 years, that the rest of the world can use modern strategies to neutralize the USAs talent advantage.</p>

<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a two-fold attack which is really closing the gap. More international players are simple more skilled (but that simply isn&rsquo;t enough). You also have the modern basketball strategies that really allows non-USA teams to compete.</p>

<p>2028 is really gonna be interesting.</p>

<p>SETs are literally designed for upsets and giving the underdog a fighting chance. If/when the USA finally loses in the Olympics&hellip;which will happen at some point&hellip;that one win in a tournament style specifically designed for upsets doesn&rsquo;t mean that &ldquo;the world has caught up&rdquo;. The USA has won 5 straight golds in men&rsquo;s, 8 straight in women&rsquo;s. The idea that the world would effectively be just as good as soon as they get one win in 20 years in a SET makes no sense to me at all.</p>

The problem is that US team often underperforms, relative to the talent/roster.</p>

<p>Even this Olympics, they would most likely missed on the gold if Steph didn&rsquo;t go nuclear. And when you remove Steph, that roster is so filthy stacked, that it is ridiculous that they are not easily blowing teams by 30 every night.</p>

<p>Or like last year losing in semis against Germany. People were &ldquo;yeah it was not our best team&rdquo;. But it was still the best roster on the tournament, by far.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union still existed in the form of the &ldquo;Unified Team&rdquo; in 1992, but, notably, the Baltic nations had siphoned off already. For Basketball, this was particularly relevant as the Soviet Union con-tainted relevant Soviets like Arvydas Sabonis, Sarunas Marciulionis and Rimas Kurtinaitis, who were all Lithuanian and would play on the Lithuanian team in 1992. Tiit Sokk was also a Soviet starter that was from Estonia. This meant that 4 out of the 5 starters from the 1988 Olympic team were now playing for other countries while most of the depth was still part of the Unified Team.</p>

<p>The other is Yugoslava. In 1988, Yugoslavia won the Silver Medal. They did even better in 1990, winning the FIBA World Championship over the Sovet Union with a starting lineup of roster of 6 Serbians, 5 Croatians and 1 Slovenian.</p>

<p>This was the final tournament before both country&rsquo;s dissolution. By 1992, the next two best national teams were no more. The remaining Soviet Union (Unified Team) and Yugoslavia (effectively Serbia) were no more and very weakened. Further, Yugoslavia (Serbia) was banned from the 1992 Olympics due to the Balkan War (similar to Russia being banned right now).</p>

<p>So the U.S. not only brought its Avenger Team, but had significantly weaker competition than it would have had just two years prior. Ultimately, Croatia, the Unifed Team and Lithuania all joined the U.S. as the other Semifinalists in the 1992 Olympics. I&rsquo;m not saying a pre-Baltic breakaway Soviet Team or unified Yugoslavia team would have seriously competed with the U.S., but they were all significantly weaker apart. Perhaps 51 and 32 point margins in the Semis and Final are a bit more respectable looking.</p>

<p>The stars were really aligned for the U.S. to beat everyone by a million points. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a college team (Duke + Fab5 with others) would have won in 1992 as well given what happened with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia teams.</p>

      <label for="lhq6xhm" class="commentText"><p>The way I see it was in 1992 USA was arguably at its peak in basketball in terms of skill, let’s say 95% while other countries were around 50%</p>

<p>Today, USA is I’d say is around 98%, the world is probably somewhere around 80-90%</p>

<p>I don’t get how USA is expected to blow teams out, when they have almost peaked and teams are catching up…..</p>

<p>Yes these are just random numbers to illustrate my point</p>

      <label for="lhqnos4" class="commentText"><p>I think a lot of it comes from people oversimplifying things a bit, concluding that the NBA is the pinnacle of basketball, so Team USA being comprised entirely of superstars from the world&rsquo;s best league should be able to overwhelm the bulk of their opponents.</p>

<p>The games, of course, aren&rsquo;t won on paper, and there&rsquo;s so much more to basketball than taking 12 stars, throwing them onto the floor, and hoping for the best. To some degree, it&rsquo;s the same reason why super teams in the NBA don&rsquo;t always work.</p>

<p>Then again, while acknowledging how good Nikola Jokic and Bogdan Bogdanovic  may be, should they really be able to run up an 18-point lead (or whatever it may have been) on a team as loaded as Team USA? Perhaps not. And we kind of caught glimpses of that when USA flexed and began to run on all cylinders. I think some folks are just out there thinking, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t the USA be running on all cylinders more frequently?&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lhqga39" class="commentText"><p>Yes but you are still seeing this purely in terms of talent. Yes Hali would probably be 2nd or 3rd best in most teams but without team chemistry and strategy, talent can only get you so far. That’s where other countries are catching up. In team sports especially in a single elimination setting, anything can happen even if one side is supremely talented. Basketball, when it’s all said and done is a game of runs. Infact as you said even if Team World was formed today with a month worth of buildup, there is no guarantee that they will every single elimination style tournament.</p>

      <label for="lhsjn9d" class="commentText"><p>People keep saying US will be totally fine. Can be the case but truth is looking at talent now and even future, I don’t see a Lebron, KD, Curry, MJ, Kobe, or even a Wade or Magic.</p>

<p>I feel it is one of the major advantages for Americans is those superstar players all in one team.</p>

<p>Now with other great players spread worldwide, even if the US has a roster of 12 all stars, peope underestimate what a Lebron or Kobe have than someone like Tatum or Edwards.</p>

<p>Edwards can be that guy, but if it only him and an older Embiid or AD, it’s not as intimidating than before.</p>

<p>And as others have said, Fiba and international play is different than league play. In football, there are teams like Brazil or England of recent years that argaubly have best talents than rest of the field and we see them struggling to win big tournaments.</p>

<p>It’s obviously more spread out in football, but I think this can possibly happen too with the world baskatball in the future whether near or distant.</p>

<p>If US doesn’t have that super advantage of having all the top 5 players on the same team the competition is much closer than before.</p>

<p>I hope France, Canada, and Serbia can keep developing and build solid teams.</p>

<p>I mean look at Canada had second best roster in talent with all nba players and they lost in the quarters.</p>

<p>If US doesn’t have a top 3-5 player and Jokic, Luka, and Wemby dominating, then chances of a US loss is posisble.</p>
