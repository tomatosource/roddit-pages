      <p>Game is currently 66-27 at halftime. Started like 20-2. Commentator said it might be the best u17 team ever. Dybantsa, the Boozer Bros, and Peat are way too big and quick. They full pressed the whole game so far and forced 20 turnovers in the half.</p>

<p>Really highlights how good this 26’ draft class could be.</p>

<p>Edit: Holt is a defensive menace</p>

      <label for="lbr1ibo" class="commentText"><p>Not commenting on whether I agree with the post, but I feel like you&rsquo;re misrepresenting its point. It isn&rsquo;t parents buying their children&rsquo;s way onto teams they don&rsquo;t currently deserve to be on, it&rsquo;s parents buying elite resources and training throughout their children&rsquo;s lives. Over time it may be getting harder and harder for other families to compete.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Half of team USA u17 team is full of NBA players&rsquo; sons. Lower-income and regular-income kids can&rsquo;t compete with the kid who&rsquo;s getting pro trainers, afford to go to top AAU programs, travel around the world, go to top prestigious highschools and such.</p>

      <label for="lbr2khn" class="commentText"><p>just looked up the pictures for both u17 rosters (canada and US) and the players all look like normal teenagers to me. Canada has more range in height since the shortest player on their team is 5ft 10 and the tallest is 7ft 7 while the us is all 6ft 3 - 6ft 10.</p>

<p>These kids are definitely more physically developed than normal but thats true for all athletic kids at high levels and is especially true for basketball since it selects for height more than any other sport in the world. US&rsquo; main advantage over Canada is having a 9x larger pool of athletes to draw from and that advantage isn&rsquo;t going to dissipate as the kids get older.</p>

I used to play soccer in The Netherlands when I was a kid, which was a lot more based on technique and tactics, but when we played against Celtic (Scotland) in an international tournament, they played a lot more physical than we ever encountered and their players were massive as well compared to most of our players since that suited their style.</p>

      <label for="lbr44a6" class="commentText"><p>Well no, generally speaking as players get more experienced the ones who are already good get a lot better than their peers. Players start off mostly similar when they are young and get more and more seperation from the general pool as they get older.</p>

<p>In any sport kids who develop earlier will have an advantage but this advantage doesn&rsquo;t disproportionately help America vs other countries. You have to remember there are tons of american kids as well with a ton of talent going through puberty later than their peers who will also benefit from getting older. The main advantage of having a larger pool of players to draw from is gonna still be there as the players get older.</p>

      <label for="lbr56ae" class="commentText"><p>That has more to do with it being their national spot I think, bigger pool, more talented. Here in the US kids rarely play hockey because it isn&rsquo;t available or it costs too much for most people. I assume the same goes for basketball, it&rsquo;s a bigger sport here so more kids that are talented will play it, rather than say soccer or so.</p>

Ja too with injuries n controversy but he’s not an mvp talent to me like the other two . When you think about Zion injuries ( and even Davis) it’s quite easy to understand why it looks like America is weaker cos there mvp lvl
Players got injured n limited . Then immediately after you had lamelo and Ant, lamelo hurt by injuries too he’s a legit offensive dynamo .</p>

<p>had that swarming quality to it. Just relentless and long arms everywhere. If Roberson could have shot slightly better, they would have taken the Warriors out. Even today, he could be reliably replaced by some other role player.</p>

      <label for="lbr5k7u" class="commentText"><p>Just like it takes a special shooting team like the Warriors to make people believe winning through shooting is possible, and that changed the meta of the league, it may take a special, super athletic and 15 men deep team to make the league believe that style may be viable.</p>

<p>Once people saw how the Warriors played, the change in style was relatively fast. The Warriors style of play would be considered the norm these days.</p>

<p>And OKC almost beat the slightly more talented Warrior team through energy and length, so talent parity is not the main factor here.</p>

<p>With the right team make up, and sufficient talent on top, I would like to see a team try this.</p>
