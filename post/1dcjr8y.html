      <label for="l7y9gfb" class="commentText"><p>The Mavs&rsquo; live ball turnovers are a fucking travesty. Those let G1 get away, and probably lost them last night&rsquo;s game. Every time they were slow in transition, and Boston had at least 8 points in fast break dunks. They were shooting terribly (which will be overshadowed because we&rsquo;re going to have this false narrative about how much worse Boston played) and couldn&rsquo;t afford to give away any possessions. And it happened way too much. Between that and the 8 missed FT&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re failing at the most basic fundamentals of basketball</p>

<p>Also Luka played exceptionally but that backcourt turnover looking for PJ Washington was beyond baffling</p>

      <label for="l7ybdxi" class="commentText"><p>Dallas missed eight FT. The final margain of victory was seven points. All else being equal, Dallas makes those missed FT they win by one point. Pretty crazy all things considered.</p>

<p>As happy as I am Boston won they got a bit of luck on their side. They won&rsquo;t win a lot of games shooting 45%. I don&rsquo;t expect them to go 10-39 from 3 either though. Just a weird overall game but i&rsquo;m happy the Celtics got the win.</p>

      <label for="l7ycz8z" class="commentText"><p>observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>make your free throws, kids.</li>
<li>Luka was brilliant as a shot-maker but he can’t keep the ball in front worth a damn and it’s put the Mavs defense in rotation on too many possessions. though he was able to finish with more assists he also had a lot of ill-advised turnovers where he clearly wasn’t even looking at where he was throwing the ball</li>
<li>Tatum‘s playing like Draymond Green with a green light. his shooting is abysmal, and he’s constantly fumbling the ball when he looks to score at the rim. but he’s probably been opening up Boston’s offense more than anyone bc Dallas is just incapable of stopping him from getting 2 feet in the paint. more than half of Holiday’s buckets last night came off Tatum assists and he’s also been fantastic defensively, particularly on the glass</li>
<li>Kyrie has been totally incapable of creating any separation using his dribble and Boston’s defenders are basically muscling him into uncomfortable spots and tough shots. that complete lack of rhythm is bleeding into misses on open jumpers</li>
<li>seemed many Mavs fans hoped Kleber would be an effective floor spacer but he clearly does not trust his shot right now and he’s struggling guarding the ball too</li>
<li>if I’m Dallas I might consider trying to run more offense through PJ Washington. he’s had some success leveraging his size advantage over our guards to attack closeouts and get to the free throw line</li>
<li>I might also consider working Gafford in the post a bit more, he was able to create some buckets and fouls out of there but at the same time I doubt that Boston would overreact to that</li>
<li>don’t see a path to winning this series for Dallas. Boston is just far too balanced, there’s no mismatch to go after defensively, and offensively they’re not having any trouble generating good shots</li>

      <label for="l7ybhgy" class="commentText"><p>This was the type of game Mavs need to win. Celtics shot like shit and Luka had a 30pt triple-double. If they don&rsquo;t win those games, they are going to have a hard time winning other ones.</p>

<p>Defensively, Mavs really need to figure shit out quick. Their POA defense on Tatum and Brown is atrocious and the 2 are just carving them up, (despite what people want to say about Tatum&rsquo;s shooting). They get by their defender on every play and get a good offensive flow 90% of the time because of it. Yea, there&rsquo;s resistance at the rim, but there&rsquo;s 0 resistance anywhere else. Honestly, even at the rim the guards on the C&rsquo;s are getting super easy looks in the dunker spot. I swear Jrue and White must have gotten 12 easy points from there. &ldquo;Protect the rim&rdquo; feels less of like a defensive philosophy with the Mavs and more of a mental block where it&rsquo;s the ONLY thing they can do.</p>

<p>Offensively, I feel like the Mavs really need to lean heavily into getting out in transition. If they can&rsquo;t score over 100pts in either game, they need to find a way to get easy buckets or inject more offense some way. More THJ and Hardy, maybe? Idk. Kyrie actually waking the fuck up? Absolutely. Live ball turnovers aren&rsquo;t helping either.</p>

<p>The good news for the Mavs offense is that this game is evidence that they don&rsquo;t need that much more offense, as long as Luka is putting up 30pt triple doubles. The bad news is that I just don&rsquo;t see a solution to their defense. Be better POA defenders, I guess?</p>

      <label for="l7yc4ex" class="commentText"><p>Yea, and Brown/Tatum were huge there too. They find Jrue in the dunker spot on their drives and Jrue is basically a 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; power forward in there.</p>
