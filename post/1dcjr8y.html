      <label for="l7ycz8z" class="commentText"><p>observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>make your free throws, kids.</li>
<li>Luka was brilliant as a shot-maker but he can’t keep the ball in front worth a damn and it’s put the Mavs defense in rotation on too many possessions. though he was able to finish with more assists he also had a lot of ill-advised turnovers where he clearly wasn’t even looking at where he was throwing the ball</li>
<li>Tatum‘s playing like Draymond Green with a green light. his shooting is abysmal, and he’s constantly fumbling the ball or getting stripped when he looks to score at the rim. but he’s probably been opening up Boston’s offense more than anyone bc Dallas is just incapable of stopping him from getting 2 feet in the paint. more than half of Holiday’s buckets last night came off Tatum assists and he’s also been fantastic defensively, particularly on the glass</li>
<li>putting the guard in the dunker spot has flummoxed Dallas defensively</li>
<li>Kyrie has been totally incapable of creating any separation using his dribble and Boston’s defenders are basically muscling him into uncomfortable spots and tough shots. that complete lack of rhythm is bleeding into misses on open jumpers</li>
<li>seemed many Mavs fans hoped Kleber would be an effective floor spacer but he clearly does not trust his shot right now and he’s struggling guarding the ball too</li>
<li>if I’m Dallas I might consider trying to run more offense through PJ Washington. he’s had some success leveraging his size advantage over our guards to attack closeouts and get to the free throw line</li>
<li>I might also consider working Gafford in the post a bit more, he was able to create some buckets and fouls out of there but at the same time I doubt that Boston would overreact to that</li>
<li>honestly, atp I don’t see a path to winning this series for Dallas, especially if they couldn’t win with the Celtics shooting like that. Boston is just far too balanced, there’s no mismatch to go after defensively, and offensively they’re not having any trouble generating good shots</li>

      <label for="l7yecay" class="commentText"><p>I noticed that too, Luka can&rsquo;t stay in front of his man and constantly gets blown by leading to his teammates scrambling and rotating to help. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a lack of lateral quickness or laziness but he watches his man pass him without even trying to slide his feet with the ball handler or contest a shot or rotate to another player. Also, his help defense is poor. He doesn&rsquo;t rotate fast to the perimeter. In the paint, his help defense is a lazy swipe at the ball and he doesn&rsquo;t make a concerted effort to block a layup or dunk.</p>

      <label for="l7ym1pd" class="commentText"><p>To his credit he&rsquo;s also banged up and being asked to shoulder a massive offensive load so it&rsquo;s understandable that he&rsquo;s tired and not able to play every single possession on both sides of the ball at 100% effort for 48 minutes. It&rsquo;s just not realistic</p>

      <label for="l7yof42" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’ve always had the opinion that he can definitely improve his conditioning but is also carrying such a playmaking/offensive load that no matter what he’s going to wear out. Only some of the greatest athletes in history like LeBron can sustain that level of two way play.</p>

      <label for="l7ysoj7" class="commentText"><p>This is the Celtics strategy though. Let Luka get his 1 on 1 in the first quarter. He won’t be able to pass (he had 11 assists, but 8 turnovers so wasn’t effective passing) and having to create his own shot non stop will make him ineffective on both ends by the second half.</p>

<p>Celtics got a ton of easy looks on Tatum just blowing by Luka (as well as others) and putting the defense in rotation (had they shot at their normal rate from 3 they would have scored 120 pts). Plus Luka was 1-7 to finish the game.</p>

<p>And this also highlights another intangible about Tatum. The man drove to the hoop non stop the whole game while playing elite defense and being on the floor 45(!) minutes. It won’t show up in the box score but that is an absolutely insane amount of work he put in that few other guys could do. Perhaps working that hard contributed to his 6-22 shooting the same way Lukas offensive load contributed to his horrible defense, but of course it will never get excused in the same way.</p>

      <label for="l7y9gfb" class="commentText"><p>The Mavs&rsquo; live ball turnovers are a fucking travesty. Those let G1 get away, and probably lost them last night&rsquo;s game. Every time they were slow in transition, and Boston had at least 8 points in fast break dunks. They were shooting terribly (which will be overshadowed because we&rsquo;re going to have this false narrative about how much worse Boston played) and couldn&rsquo;t afford to give away any possessions. And it happened way too much. Between that and the 8 missed FT&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re failing at the most basic fundamentals of basketball</p>

<p>Also Luka played exceptionally but that backcourt turnover looking for PJ Washington was beyond baffling</p>

      <label for="l7yetw0" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not a false narrative to say Boston played worse than they usually do. They shot 12% lower on threes then they did on the season, and especially in the first half they quite a few open looks that they bricked. Tatum had a very poor game shooting but found other ways to impact the game. Without the FT misses or Kyries bad game they don&rsquo;t win this. Even with that if PP doesn&rsquo;t hit that crazy three the game plays out differently. </p>

      <label for="l7ybhgy" class="commentText"><p>This was the type of game Mavs need to win. Celtics shot like shit and Luka had a 30pt triple-double. If they don&rsquo;t win those games, they are going to have a hard time winning other ones.</p>

<p>Defensively, Mavs really need to figure shit out quick. Their POA defense on Tatum and Brown is atrocious and the 2 are just carving them up, (despite what people want to say about Tatum&rsquo;s shooting). They get by their defender on every play and get a good offensive flow 90% of the time because of it. Yea, there&rsquo;s resistance at the rim, but there&rsquo;s 0 resistance anywhere else. Honestly, even at the rim the guards on the C&rsquo;s are getting super easy looks in the dunker spot. I swear Jrue and White must have gotten 12 easy points from there. &ldquo;Protect the rim&rdquo; feels less of like a defensive philosophy with the Mavs and more of a mental block where it&rsquo;s the ONLY thing they can do.</p>

<p>Offensively, I feel like the Mavs really need to lean heavily into getting out in transition. If they can&rsquo;t score over 100pts in either game, they need to find a way to get easy buckets or inject more offense some way. More THJ and Hardy, maybe? Idk. Kyrie actually waking the fuck up? Absolutely. Live ball turnovers aren&rsquo;t helping either.</p>

<p>The good news for the Mavs offense is that this game is evidence that they don&rsquo;t need that much more offense, as long as Luka is putting up 30pt triple doubles. The bad news is that I just don&rsquo;t see a solution to their defense. Be better POA defenders, I guess?</p>

      <label for="l7ybdxi" class="commentText"><p>Dallas missed eight FT. The final margain of victory was seven points. All else being equal, Dallas makes those missed FT they win by one point. Pretty crazy all things considered.</p>

<p>As happy as I am Boston won they got a bit of luck on their side. They won&rsquo;t win a lot of games shooting 45%. I don&rsquo;t expect them to go 10-39 from 3 either though. Just a weird overall game but i&rsquo;m happy the Celtics got the win.</p>

      <label for="l7yfwvk" class="commentText"><p>I get the point about Dallas&rsquo; FTs but if the Celtics shot anywhere close to their season average for 3s, they would&rsquo;ve ran away with it too. That&rsquo;s why they play 48.</p>

      <label for="l7yssiv" class="commentText"><p>The difference is that the Mavs shot like ass cause Boston&rsquo;s defense was smothering them. Celtics on the other hand got a lot of great looks but the shots just didn&rsquo;t fall, so many clean looks rimmed out. If Boston keeps playing defense like this, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything the Mavs can do to stop them. If the Celtics shoot even 5% better from three the next game it&rsquo;ll be a blowout.</p>

      <label for="l7yje2f" class="commentText"><p>My flair aside, I think what the Celtics are doing through the first two games is really flexing their depth on offense. It seems like anyone can generate a mini spark whether it be KP in game 1 with big plays from Jaylen in the third when it was close and now in game 2 holiday had the hot hand but you got big contributions from others. Tatum can have a “bad” offensive night and we aren’t skipping a beat because the litany of talented scorers is picking up the slack. Dallas can’t take away <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>It really feels like unless it’s Luka for Dallas creating or scoring, it’s not going to be anyone. Kyrie has been such a slower version of himself. I applaud the efforts of JB and Jrue but at the peak of Kyrie’s powers it felt like no one would be able to stay in front of him the way those two have been able. For the Mavericks to turn the tide it’s going to need to come from him as a second facilitator/scorer. He and Luka might both need 20+ points 10+ assists. I just don’t believe in the “others” on the Mavericks to shoot from 3 if not in the corner. Spacing is becoming an issue with no lob threat and to open things up you need to hit threes and the Celtics took away the corner spot.</p>

<p>I don’t know how the Celtics were able to keep pace when Luka had his 20+ in the first half and the Celtics were 1-11 or something from 3. It was the exact game Boston should have been losing by 10+ and get the mavericks lead never surpassed 5 if I recall.</p>

      <label for="l7ykd9j" class="commentText"><p>There’s a lot on Luka’s shoulders right now and he needs some help if Dallas wants to win this.</p>

<p>He’s exerting a ton of energy on offense to keep Dallas afloat and the Celtics are too deep for the Mavs to hide him on defense.</p>

<p>He’s banged up with a ton of minutes on his body this postseason. He just can’t keep up with the Boston barrage of attacks.</p>

<p>Celtics were abysmal from three all night and Tatum hasn’t found any scoring rhythm all series. Scary thought for Dallas that Boston can struggle like that and still win.</p>

<p>It was KP in game 1 and Jrue in game 2. The depth of the Celtics allows for Tatum to play facilitator and they can win without getting scoring from their top guy. Dallas does not have that luxury.</p>

<p>I expect Dallas to be locked in on Wednesday. Back home their role players, and Kyrie, should play much better. Kyrie seemed uncomfortable both games in Boston. Dallas needs him to play at his best to have a shot in this.</p>

      <label for="l7ytd72" class="commentText"><p>We were abysmal from 3, but Dallas was somehow even worse at 23%. The Celtics have won purely by three point volume, even if they shoot like garbage they shoot enough to overcome it. It doesn’t help that Dallas loves to double Tatum while the Celtics play man-on and refuse to give up easy threes.</p>

<p>Game 1:</p>

<p>Celtics: <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>42</sub> - 38.1%</p>

<p>Mavericks: <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub> - 25.9%</p>

<p>Game 2:</p>

<p>Celtics: <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>39</sub> - 25.6%</p>

      <label for="l7ytn5t" class="commentText"><p>There is no worse matchup for Kyrie and Luka than the current version of these Boston Celtics. Four wings who are excellent defenders who can easily switch onto him and take away his layup game, forcing him into difficult isolation jump shots exclusively without drawing extra coverage.</p>

<p>Nearly every Kyrie possession in this series has been a net win for Boston, particularly if he can&rsquo;t stretch the floor (0-8 from three). He is playing low IQ 1-on-1 ball that freezes out his team, allowing most of Boston&rsquo;s defense to rest. And he&rsquo;s not getting to the free throw line either, he&rsquo;s not able to blow by anyone. 2 FTAs in this series (averaged 5 a game against Minnesota).</p>

<p>With Kyrie going sideways, while Luka is getting his numbers in single coverage, the Celtics are able to crowd up the passing lanes and force turnovers. Dallas&rsquo;s offense thrives on the double-teams from the Luka trap (and you saw a few good looks from that tonight when Boston&rsquo;s bigs forgot the base coverage), but when everyone is guarding their man it becomes a mess. 12 turnovers for Luka in this series.</p>

<p>The only way I see this becoming a series is if Porzingis is hobbled. While Horford is playing solid basketball, at his age you do not want to call on him to play 35 minutes and wear down as he gets targeted more and more. If I were Dallas I&rsquo;d call out the big pick and roll action as much as possible and try and force Boston to stretch their big rotation.</p>

<p>But even then it&rsquo;s hard to see Boston&rsquo;s core 4 dropping 4 of 5 games, particularly given the huge advantage they have on Irving.</p>
