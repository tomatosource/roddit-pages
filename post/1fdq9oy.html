<p>[holmes] Ex Sun’s employee files discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuit for $60 million against the team.</p>

<p>That ex-employee, Andrea Trischan, who was the Suns&rsquo; program manager of diversity, equity and inclusion, filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Arizona Attorney General&rsquo;s office&rsquo;s civil rights division, which is investigating the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ms. Trischan filed a formal complaint &hellip; due to ongoing racial discrimination, harassment, and retaliation she experienced while employed with the Phoenix Suns,&rdquo; Trischan&rsquo;s attorney, Sheree Wright, wrote in an email to ESPN. &ldquo;Specifically, Ms. Trischan endured overt racist comments and a hostile work environment that went unaddressed despite being reported to HR and executive leadership.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ESPN published another investigation outlining allegations of misconduct by several Suns executives who employees said played key roles in perpetuating a troubling workplace culture under Sarver. Some of those executives included then-team president and CEO Jason Rowley; executive vice president and chief revenue officer Dan Costello; Kyle Pottinger, the Suns&rsquo; senior vice president of ticket sales and service; and Goldenberg.</p>

<p>When Trischan read ESPN&rsquo;s story, she realized that some of the executives accused of misconduct had also been named to the team&rsquo;s diversity council, Trischan said in her statement, which was sent to the Suns and the civil rights division of the AG&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>Trischan in the statement that she then began investigating claims of misconduct against those executives. That same month, Trischan said Kim Corbitt, her direct manager and the Suns&rsquo; head of human resources, expressed concerns to Trischan about her investigation into Suns&rsquo; executives and to &ldquo;cease her investgation into the report.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trischan said she voiced concerns to Corbitt about the executives who were named in the ESPN story, noting that they were mistrusted by staff while questioning their presence on the diversity council.</p>

<p>According to Trischan&rsquo;s statement, Corbitt told Trischan that the executives were on the diversity council as a means to &ldquo;reshape their image.&rdquo;</p>
