</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m thinking of Bulls Pau Gasol, this was his first year out of LA after seven seasons as a Laker and he was pretty good as a vet for a team looking to make the best of DRose&rsquo;s last hurrah as a productive starter, lots of strict defense and team ball that Pau slotted into nicely as a playmaking finesse big in the front court with Noah, giving them much different looks than Boozer.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also Detroit Blake Griffin, who carried a really bad Pistons team to an 8th seed where he got injured then proceeded to deteriorate every year afterward.</p>

<p>I think Suns Chris Paul might be looking like this, he was a good vet influence on the post Russ Thunder and got traded to a Suns team on the upswing, which he backseat drove to the Finals as Booker&rsquo;s main backcourt partner and a PnR machine with Ayton, then CP3 followed it up with an even better season in 2022, that ended in really shit fashion, it was all downhill from there and he&rsquo;s now currently the Warriors&rsquo; sixth man.</p>

<p>Would Nuggets AI count towards this seeing as he was elite as Melo&rsquo;s second star but slowly fizzled out every year after leaving Denver?</p>

<p>It’s strange because I never thought of him as a good three point shooter before and he doesn’t have the form of a pure shooter either. He just changed uniforms and completely changed how many saw his game, for a year.</p>

<p>After 3 straight All-Star appearances and 2 straight All-NBA selections with the Warriors, a knee injury wiped out his 1993-1994 season, and Hardaway was traded to the Heat a few seasons later, after it was clear he wasn’t the same player.</p>

<p>In his first 3 seasons with the Heat, he never missed more than 2 games per season, and was selected to 2 All-Star teams and 3 All-NBA teams (including 1st team in 1997)</p>

You&rsquo;re going to find a few of these on the heat, when the whole culture thing started. Anthony Mason had a resurgence, Ike Austin was another. Riley loves vets with something to prove, it&rsquo;s how they end up with Terry porter, penny, stack house, Skip2MyLou.</p>
