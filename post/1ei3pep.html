Giannis and luka both have very fair arguments for being the best with embied and somewhat shai having a decent case. But overall having a top 3 player in the league makes you a contender.</p>

They had a monster run absolute credit to them but in terms of roster quality they just don&rsquo;t stack up to the other teams in the contenders tier IMO. If we have teams like Denver, Milwaukee, even Phoenix as dark horses then I struggle to say Dallas is a tier above those guys. Again credit to them on a fantastic playoff run well deserved finals berth but I&rsquo;m just keeping it 100</p>

<p>Suns looked terrible in the Playoffs and the Bucks seem to be getting too old / injured.</p>

<p>I think having Klay (maybe off the bench when the playoffs start) and healthy Luka should put us pretty firmly on the same level as Sixers, Knicks, Nuggets and Wolves.</p>

<p>Projecting teams’ success by doing Previous year’s playoff result +/- adjustment for offseason moves just isn’t reliable at all.</p>

<p>It was dumb of people to see the Mavs as a fringe playoff team before last year just because they missed the play-in in 2022, but I think it’s also wrong to see them as top contenders this year just because they made the Finals last year.</p>

      <label for="lg442wo" class="commentText"><p>Not to say Celtics aren&rsquo;t the title favorites but one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is every year we put the defending champs as a title favorite for the following year, just for them to exit in the second round or less.</p>

<ul>
<li>2020 Lakers - 1st round exit in 2021</li>
<li>2021 Bucks - 2nd round exit in 2022</li>
<li>2022 Warriors - 2nd round exit in 2023</li>
<li>2023 Nuggets - 2nd round exit in 2024</li>
</ul>

<p>And I excluded 2019 Raptors because I don&rsquo;t think anyone put them as favorites after Kawhi exit. It&rsquo;s just really hard to sustain a dynasty in modern NBA, after KD warriors era was over. The chances are some other team than the Celtics will win.</p>

<p>The exhaustion of having to defend your title creates an inherent disadvantage. It’s not just the mental weight either, it’s that you literally had to play longer and got less of a break than everybody else except one other team. </p>

<p>Add to that the multiple players who may be sacrificing what little rest they would’ve had for international competitions (three Celtics this year, two Bucks in 2021, etc.) and it’s really hard to not respect how damn hard it is to repeat. </p>

      <label for="lg4l1tl" class="commentText"><p>I think you’re 100% right that fans in general tend to underrate how likely it is for a team to get significantly better or worse in a single year, even with only marginal roster/health changes.</p>

<p>Not only have the last 5 defending champs failed to make the conference finals the following year, but also 5 of the last 10 teams to make the Finals were coming off a season in which they missed the playoffs.</p>

<p>That being said I think Boston is an exception. Compare their results in the 2 years before winning the title to the results of the previous 5 champs:</p>

<p>Raptors : 2nd round, 2nd round, title, 2nd round, lottery</p>

<p>Lakers : lottery, lottery, title, 1st round, lottery</p>

<p>Bucks : ECF, 2nd round, title, 2nd round, 1st round</p>

<p>Warriors : lottery, lottery, title, 2nd round, lottery</p>

<p>Nuggets : 2nd round, 1st round, title, 2nd round, ???</p>

<p>Celtics : Finals, ECF, title, ???, ???</p>

<p>The Celtics had by far the most success in the years prior to their title compared to all other champs in this timeframe, it makes sense to give them more benefit of the doubt. With Porzingis out to start the year and Horford being a year older I don’t think they’ll have as dominant a season beginning to end as last year but come playoff time it makes sense to consider them the top dog, at least for the East.</p>

      <label for="lg54ec6" class="commentText"><p>I think the Celtics are a little different than the teams that won the past few years because they didn’t lose any rotational players, have a pretty deep bench for the regular season, and have a lot of durable players (Tatum, White, Jrue, Hauser, Pritchard, Horford are all really durable). The only old players are Horford and Jrue so I don’t think a situation like the 2011 Lakers or 2023 Warriors applies here. If you want to say a Porzingis injury or some other unexpected injury is likely and that makes them susceptible to losing to another team in the East, it’s certainly possible. But if we’re assuming health, I just don’t know how you can pick another team to beat them before the ECF when they’ve been there 3 years in a row.</p>

<p>Even with Porzingis out let’s say they win 8-10 less games. 54-56 wins should still be enough for a top 3 seed and they just check all the boxes of talent and experience. Whether the 1st round is Cleveland, Miami, Indiana, or Orlando, the Celtics just edge them out in talent and/or experience, and if the 2nd round is NY, Philly or Milwaukee, I mean we also have to factor in Embiid is never healthy by that point and NY’s current center rotation is going to have a really hard time with Boston’s bigs, plus Boston has the experience thing over them.</p>

<p>I’m biased as a Celtics fan, but I think the only thing stopping them from another ECF appearance at minimum is health and chemistry issues where after winning, guys aren’t playing their role as well.</p>

<p>But if this team is firing on all cylinders like last year and can get proper rest to not run out of gas, that’s just a tough matchup for anyone. Just like how the Heat work their spooky voodoo and you can never count them out, I don’t think you can count out this Boston team after proving they can win.</p>

<p>Their core is relatively young and I feel like that’s more relevant for repeated success.</p>

      <label for="lg4ylpb" class="commentText"><p>Yes people have an awful habit of overhyping the previous season&rsquo;s champion.  But there are a few major differences this year:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>None of those other teams had historical regular seasons like the Celtics.  Celtics had the 4th highest net rating in history at 11.6.  Those other teams were Lakers 5.7, Bucks 5.7, Warriors 5.6, Nuggets 3.4.  Those other teams were merely very good, but the 23-24 Celtics are the first truly elite champion since the KD Warriors.  Not un-coincidentally, the Warriors were the last champion to repeat and did so with ease.</p></li>

<li><p>None of those other teams returned every single rotation player like the Celtics.  All lost key role players.</p></li>

<li><p>None of those other teams won a title without one of their best players in the postseason.  Celtics were the best team in the NBA even without Porzingis.  They actually have significant potential to win the title even easier this year with a healthy KP.</p></li>

<li><p>None of those other teams went into the season as title favorites. All were contenders, but only the Celtics were the clear favorites.  Between their annual deep runs and the new moves they made, the Celtics had all the pressure in the world - anything less than a title was going to be considered a failure by the basketball world.  The pressure of repeating is absolutely nothing compared to what these guys must have felt last year.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Long story short - if they can keep everybody besides KP healthy, they&rsquo;re going to repeat.  If KP is healthy for the postseason, they&rsquo;ll do it with ease.</p>

Their only hope for him is AD or Lebron getting hurt for most of the season and the Lakers being terrible as a result. The Hawks are going to try to win as many games as possible with their roster because being bad literally only helps the Spurs for the next 3 years.</p>

It needs to be a pretty major move, but hypothetically you pair another All-Star (or even fringe All Star) with Lebron and AD, and yeah, they&rsquo;re fucking dangerous in the postseason.</p>

<p>As is they&rsquo;re not winning though.</p>

<p>I’d move lakers up , even tho I think we need a move . And I’d move magic grizz n pacers into tier 3.5 or just tier 4.</p>

<p>Nuggets n bucks belong up a tier too. Both winning woukd not be outlandish . I’d move dallas down or you can keep them
There idk.</p>

<p>I know what the numbers said, but they also suggested that Boston should have beaten Miami the years they lost, and the Warriors should have lost to them in the Finals.</p>

<p>What ifs will never prove anything, but I will die on a hill saying that Denver would have beat them and Wolves would have given them a better challenge. Matchups are way more important than people want to acknowledge.</p>

<p>A few teams might make it further based off of conference, injury luck, and matchups like the Pacers and 2021 Hawks, but they are most likely to regress unless a major move catapults them into higher tiers.</p>

On top of that, Murray has been playing like ass. He’s inconsistent, injury prone, and now he’s gonna be a year older. The Westbrook gamble has the potential to fail spectacularly like when he joined the Lakers. Jokic is the best player in the league but he can’t make miracles happen. The West is more competitive than ever right now too</p>

<p>People act like Nuggets got swept in the 2nd round, but they lost in 7 where they even put themselves in a position where they should have won</p>

<p>Sixers is more of an Embiid + PG13 kinda thing. On paper they have the talent, but you have just seen it fail too many times, and winning 4 series is a marathon</p>

<p>You can argue Knicks being borderline contenders, but they’ll get the benefit of the doubt where the Sixers doesn’t</p>

      <label for="lg4zsxh" class="commentText"><p>I think his point is that Embiid and PG13 are likely never going to have a healthy postseason together, so the Sixers are not really worth thinking about as a real contender.   (And even with George shows up in the postseason, he shits the bed constantly)</p>

<p>Sixers only chance of even getting past the second round is both having Embiid at 100% and George healthy and playing at his best.  Which seems almost impossible.</p>

I’ve seen no one who thinks the Sixers are contenders think PG isn’t the biggest reason. I’ve seen no Clippers fans think the Sixers are contenders because they have watched PG digress steadily for five years and know that the idea of PG is greater than actually having PG. The original comment was about a Clippers fan who was ignoring something that everyone who watched significant portions of the Clippers last season have been saying</p>

<p>A team with Kyrie and Luka doesn&rsquo;t need more offense</p>

      <label for="lg3uihp" class="commentText"><p>And they got back Naji and Grimes. DJJ had a good year with Dallas but there’s a reason he was a minimum deal. Dallas was 30% from open and wide open threes in the Finals. Boston was 44%. Dallas lost two games by 7.</p>

      <label for="lg43nko" class="commentText"><p>Mavs definitely improved: both Naji Marshall and Quentin Grimes are really good defenders from what I heard from Pelicans and Knicks fans, not to mention that they are way better than DJJ from three. Then we will have Klay as the 3rd option on offense replacing THJ, which is a huge upgrade. Lively is expected to be even better in his 2nd year too. And just the fact that we will start the season with PJ and Gafford means Luka won&rsquo;t need to hard carry the team as he did in the first half of the last season in order to Mavs barely compete for a playoff spot (he averaged 41 minutes on court from november to january averaging 37/9/11).</p>
