<p>Yes, the one who averaged 38/17/3 with 3 blocks and a steal was saved by Kobes 15ppg on below league average true shooting.</p>

<p>Shaq was the guy on those teams and it wasn’t disputable. Bryant played 3 games in the Pacers series and was horrible(horrifically bad) in 2 of them.</p>

<p>Kobe took over that game 7, if they lost that game Shaq takes all the heat and blows a 3-1 lead along with multiple sweeps on his resume up until that point.</p>

<p>You act like Kobe is some scrub for some reason in that single series even though we both know he was injured, and he still managed to come up huge all playoffs that season.</p>

      <label for="l752fqp" class="commentText"><p>Just isolating one game and saying oh if Shaq loses this, his legacy is done, is entirely nonsense, because O’Neal would’ve got the job done eventually and won a chip (or multiple) with any all star guard. He was by far the most dominant offensive center we have ever seen, and it would’ve been impossible to stop him breaking through.</p>

<p>Shaq gave the 04 Pistons, the greatest defense of all time post Sheed trade, the absolute work. You’d have to foul out a full front court to stop him.</p>

<p>He only played 3 games. It was Shaqs team.</p>

<p>His efficiency would’ve had him benched if this was the modern day. He was shooting 10% below league average and was throwing it up 15 times a game.</p>

The FMVP count was the one solid legacy argument against Kobe&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got 5 and you&rsquo;ve got 4&rdquo; and I have never seen or heard Shaq even attempt to pull that trigger even at the most volatile point in their relationship.

      <label for="l7509km" class="commentText"><p>You don’t need the FMVPs to tell who the lead guy or better player was with any honest view. Shaq is the most dominant and best big man scorer of all time. He was fouling out full front courts. His offensive rebounding was amazing. He could pass very well out of the post. When he tried on defense, he’d produce a great one eg the 2000 Lakers who improved heavily with an in shape O’Neal.</p>

<p>His 5 year plus minus stretch in his prime is only beaten by Cavs Lebron and Wolves Kevin Garnett. In 32 games without Shaq from 2000-2003 and full strength otherwise, the Lakers were a slightly above league average offense. When Shaq was in, they were one of the best in history.</p>

<p>We have a pretty big 29 game sample without Kobe in 2000 and 2001. Shaq, flanked by Glen Rice instead and other role players, produced a top 5 offense and a 54 win pace. It stands to reason if you replace Glen Rice with virtually any all star guard floating around the league at this time, you get a 60 win team with ease.</p>

<p>The 1997-2001 Lakers is still the best post season offense of all time(even ahead of teams like the 7SOL Suns, KD Warriors, Dirks Mavericks who sacrificed some defense for offense). Kobe was no different to any of the other all star guards in the NBA for all of this stretch. Hell, he definitely wasn’t better than Penny Hardaway in <sup>95</sup>&frasl;<sub>96</sub>, yet you don’t see people saying he was the #1 on the Magic, because it wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>Shaq and Penny produced one of the best healthy offenses of all time, multiple years before he moved to LA.</p>

      <label for="l74wut4" class="commentText"><p>Shaq was the better player of the two and the driver of those offenses, but Kobe has had matchups where he was more effective, like against the Spurs in the West.</p>

<p>An interesting hypothetical would be how those two would be perceived if Kobe won a FMVP or even multiple if they were playing the Spurs in the finals rather than the relatively weak final opponents they played from 2000-02.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of silly how much weight is placed in the finals and finals mvp, when I would argue the best teams the Lakers played during their run were pretty much all in the West, outside of the 2004 Pistons.</p>

      <label for="l74x603" class="commentText"><p>I refuse to believe you watched any of the 3 peat if you think there was any “stopping” Kobe.</p>

<p>There is <em>plenty</em> of info out there about how equal they were in the playoffs. It is so obvious if you watched back then, it all lines up with the eye test. Kobe’s numbers absolutely jump off the page in the entire Western playoffs, when every team had big front courts that could give Shaq trouble. Then every year they played much smaller teams in the finals so Shaq took over. One year Kobe led the entire playoffs in Win Shares. Including Shaq.</p>

<p>Now, this is not to say I think Kobe was better/more unstoppable/more valuable. Just you guys go way too far with it, pretending it was black and white. It was always “pick your poison” and every analyst/coach recognized that they were <strong>both</strong> unstoppable, and their ceiling without each other would never have been as high.</p>

      <label for="l7508ev" class="commentText"><p>Kobe basically didn&rsquo;t play in a win against the Pacers in the 2000 Finals, and was the primary reason they lost the prelast game.</p>

<p>In the first game &amp; win of the series he also played mediocre. Did very little for the 38 minutes he was in the game. Rick Fox probably had a larger impact.</p>

<p>The other two games we can at least say he was the 2nd best player on the team and entertain Shaq&rsquo;s notion from the title. But fucking hard to do it. The numbers just kill it before even watching the tape. And that is for the 2 games out of 5 that we can even try to give it a shot. Shaq was a monster from start to finish.</p>

<p>It is a different story for the other two finals, but you said three peat so I just wanted showcase how you definetly did not watch that first finals if you had a line like that. Kobe had a long way to go that year.</p>

<p>Kobe was much, much easier to slow down than shaq. Stop was not to correct word cause you dont stop players that are this good. But you can slow them down.</p>

<p>The whole league was built to stop shaq, and you are here talking about them being “equals” gtfo.</p>

      <label for="l74yki1" class="commentText"><p>That first paragraph is the most absurd perspective I’ve seen on this debate. So now Kobe doesn’t get credit for how good he was because Shaq was good? Shouldn’t that logic go both ways? Kobe demanded double teams all game, just like Shaq. You don’t think that helped him in the paint?</p>

<p>You realize Shaq didn’t play every game, right? He had injuries (hello big toe) and Kobe carried the team. Carried the team in the finals after Shaq fouled out, on a sprained ankle. Specifically remember Shaq calling him his “hero” after one game when he carried the team without him.</p>

<p>You don’t think there would be narratives and data out there already if Kobe played worse without Shaq on the court? I’d love to see anything that leads you to give Shaq direct credit for Kobe’s play. He only got better after Shaq left.</p>

      <label for="l74zeb5" class="commentText"><p>Kobe did not demand double teams as much as shaq, stop talking shit.</p>

<p>Nobody is saying Kobe was not great. He was great, he was carrying the team. He was still not as good as shaq. There is absolutely no way you watch a lakers game from that period and come out thinking Kobe was more important for the team than shaq lmao. Kobe fans are something else man</p>

<p>Please, please show me where I said he was “more important” or “better”. I literally, specifically, stated in my <em>first</em> reply that I am <strong>not</strong> saying that. I just feel it’s necessary to push back when people who clearly weren’t there spout off clear regurgitation of bullshit they saw on Reddit.</p>
