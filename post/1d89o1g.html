      <label for="l74ufzx" class="commentText"><p>15-20 years ago the idea of Shaq being one of the most passionate ambassadors and defenders of Kobe&rsquo;s legacy would have been insane. The FMVP count was the one solid legacy argument against Kobe&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got 5 and you&rsquo;ve got 4&rdquo; and I have never seen or heard Shaq even attempt to pull that trigger even at the most volatile point in their relationship. I completely buy that Shaq feels this way and has always felt this way.</p>

      <label for="l7509km" class="commentText"><p>You don’t need the FMVPs to tell who the lead guy or better player was with any honest view. Shaq is the most dominant and best big man scorer of all time. He was fouling out full front courts. His offensive rebounding was amazing. He could pass very well out of the post. When he tried on defense, he’d produce a great one eg the 2000 Lakers who improved heavily with an in shape O’Neal.</p>

<p>His 5 year plus minus stretch in his prime is only beaten by Cavs Lebron and Wolves Kevin Garnett. In 32 games without Shaq from 2000-2003 and full strength otherwise, the Lakers were a slightly above league average offense. When Shaq was in, they were one of the best in history.</p>

<p>We have a pretty big 29 game sample without Kobe in 2000 and 2001. Shaq, flanked by Glen Rice instead and other role players, produced a top 5 offense and a 54 win pace. It stands to reason if you replace Glen Rice with virtually any all star guard floating around the league at this time, you get a 60 win team with ease.</p>

<p>The 1997-2001 Lakers is still the best post season offense of all time(even ahead of teams like the 7SOL Suns, KD Warriors, Dirks Mavericks who sacrificed some defense for offense). Kobe was no different to any of the other all star guards in the NBA for all of this stretch. Hell, he definitely wasn’t better than Penny Hardaway in <sup>95</sup>&frasl;<sub>96</sub>, yet you don’t see people saying he was the #1 on the Magic, because it wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>Shaq and Penny produced one of the best healthy offenses of all time, multiple years before he moved to LA, and years before his peak.</p>

That simply isn’t true. Everyone recognized he was special. During the second and third year in a row, he was absolutely destroying the Western Conference, and then Shaq would destroy the inevitably weak Center in Finals (yes, even Mutombo, but especially Todd MacCulloch)</p>

      <label for="l756hfw" class="commentText"><p>Because teams would relentlessly employ Hack-a-Shaq and foul out front courts to stop him lol. The NBA discussed rule changes after that Blazers series in 2000. O’Neal shot 99 free throws in that series. Next best was Rasheed at 48.</p>

<p>The only series Kobe was legitimately better was the 01 WCF, but then Shaq put up 33/16/5 with 3 blocks on 7% better true shooting in the finals.</p>

<p>Shaq destroyed Mutombo and Ben Wallace in the finals, two multiple time DPOYs who lead excellent defenses. Kobe regressed in the Pacers/76ers finals and they needed every bit of Shaqs scoring.</p>

<p>Kobe had some magnificent performances, often better than Shaq, against this sub&rsquo;s darlings, Duncan Spurs.  Against DPOY runner up Bruce Bowen</p>

<p>Three of the absolute top alphas of the 2000s, Dirk, Timmy, Nash, respected the shit out of Kobe and his game</p>

      <label for="l757c9c" class="commentText"><p>Crazy how this take is upvoted, people here seriously hate Kobe. Kobe was already a better player than Hardaway in 2000 let alone in 2001-04  when Kobe was way better and a top 5 player by then. Kobe, 2001 and onwards, was an MVP level guard that’s was very elite on offence and defence, and the best player in multiple playoff series over peak Shaq, including some of the most competitive series. That is <strong>irreplaceable</strong>.</p>

<p>Penny was 3rd in MVP voting in <sup>95</sup>&frasl;<sub>96</sub>. Kobe didn’t achieve this until 02-03. Nobody says Penny was a #1 option because he’s not as famous as Kobe.</p>

<p>Without Shaq playing, Hardaway posted 27 a game on 10% rTS%, a better mark than Bryant has ever managed in his entire career. He lead the Magic to a top 3 offense and a stellar 50 win pace. His career changed with an injury, but again, nobody calls him the #1 option because he wasn’t.</p>

<p>Without Shaq, the Lakers lead by Kobe were barely an above league average offense.</p>

He matured a lot as a player and a person later on.</p>

<p>08-10 Kobe is a different story.  I’ll take that version of Kobe over the younger, more athletic but ultimately more volatile version.</p>

      <label for="l75lir5" class="commentText"><p>I agree that 99-2000 Kobe wasn’t as good as prime Penny, but this is a really reductive argument. You can’t simply remove Shaq off each team and be like “look what each guy did without him!” You’re completely ignoring roster construction and which team is better equipped to absorb that loss, which the Lakers were not. That Magic team had drafted Shaq and was very deep around him; the Lakers had signed Shaq as a FA and lacked scoring outside of him and Kobe.</p>

<p>The ‘95/95 Magic team had Nick Anderson, Dennis Scott, and Horace Grant pretty much in their primes. The Lakers 3rd leading scorer after Kobe and Shaq in <sup>99</sup>&frasl;<sub>2000</sub> was Glen Rice…after that it was a 36 year old Ron Harper with 7 ppg.</p>

<p>Like I said, <sup>99</sup>&frasl;<sub>2000</sub> Kobe wasn’t as good, but in 2000-01 he put up 28.5/6/5. That would put him at 30.7 ppg pace adjusted to today’s game.</p>

<p>While there’s no argument Shaq was the most important player on that team, Kobe was only .2 ppg shy of him and was the 1B on a team that went 15-1 in the playoffs. He put up <sup>48</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> on <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub> shooting to close out the Kings and then followed that up by dropping <sup>45</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on a 58-24 Spurs team.</p>

<p>You vastly undersold how good Kobe was in your previous post, pointing out that “he and Shaq” had one of the best offenses in Orlando while ignoring the rest of their talented roster I referenced earlier.</p>

<p>Shaq’s point was that Kobe COULD have been Finals MVP if they had decided to play differently during those 3peats. I don’t think he was claiming that the team would have necessarily had the same ceiling, but that they still would have won. I think that’s a fair argument to make for the 01/02 titles given that they won the title in 5 and 4 games those years and Kobe outplayed Shaq in the WCF in 01 (a 4 game sweep of Duncan in his prime where Kobe averaged 33/7/7 for the series).</p>

<p>I think if you asked Gregg Popovich he would probably agree with Shaq…</p>

<p>Go back to your statsheet and stop embarassing yourself. &lsquo;96 Penny wasn&rsquo;t half the player that the three-peat Kobe was, Kobe was one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, that in itself separated him from Penny, Kobe even outplayed Shaq in mutilple playoff series he played in.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really sad how the discourse around Kobe these days is dominated by idiots that never watched him play, there&rsquo;s zero chance one can have watched Kobe Bryant during the 2000s and conjure dumbass takes like &ldquo;He was never the best player in the league!&rdquo; or &ldquo;He got carried by Shaq&rdquo; or the worse offender of them all &ldquo;He is not Top 10 of all-time, this is not disrespect&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yes, the one who averaged 38/17/3 with 3 blocks and a steal was saved by Kobes 15ppg on below league average true shooting.</p>

<p>Shaq was the guy on those teams and it wasn’t disputable. Bryant played 3 games in the Pacers series and was horrible(horrifically bad) in 2 of them.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t put him over the Jordan/LeBron/Wilt/Russell/Kareem group, but you can argue for him over most other guys depending on what you’re looking for and what you value. I’d put Bird and Magic ahead of him but they’re both hurt by their poor luck with health issues and the fact that they played during a league that was very much in transition and <em>going through some shit</em>.</p>

He was by far the most dominant offensive center we have ever seen, and it would’ve been impossible to stop him breaking through.</p>

<p>Shaq gave the 04 Pistons, the greatest defense of all time post Sheed trade, the absolute work. You’d have to foul out a full front court to stop him.</p>

<p>If they lose that game Shaq’s legacy takes a huge hit considering that was his MVP season they’d be calling him a fake MVP like they do to Embiid now.</p>

<p>You say “any all star guard” when it’s been proven Shaq never won without a top 3 shooting guard of all time. Kobe meanwhile won with Gasol who was literally a fringe all-star that was 0-12 in the playoffs before joining LA.</p>

<p>Maybe just maybe they went on the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> Finals run because it’s the only time in NBA history that the #1 and #2 players in the NBA were in a team together.</p>

<p>Just isolating one game and saying oh if Shaq loses this, his legacy is done, is entirely nonsense, because O’Neal would’ve got the job done eventually and won a chip (or multiple) with any all star guard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 00 if your 2nd All Star doesn&rsquo;t outscore, outrebound, and out assist Shaq in WCF G7, you just lost a ring</p>

<p>In 01 Shaq was a living god but people also forget that the Lakers were down 1-0 and only up 2 at the half of Game 2, if your second All Star doesn&rsquo;t cook in the 3rd quarter to go +8 in an 9pt win then you might be down 2-0 headed to Philly. This is also assuming Shaq solos the Spurs</p>

<p>In 02 if your second All Star doesn&rsquo;t post 31/11/5 on 50% shooting in WCF G6, you just lost a ring. If he then doesn&rsquo;t follow that up with at least 30/10/7 (admittedly on worse shooting) you still lost that ring</p>

<p>But yeah let&rsquo;s just say Shaq would have 3peated with Michael Finley lol. Realistically he would have won 01 and then as the second option in 06 but you&rsquo;re drastically underestimating what the 3peat meant for Shaq&rsquo;s legacy and how close it was to not happening</p>

<p>His efficiency would’ve had him benched if this was the modern day. He was shooting 10% below league average and was throwing it up 15 times a game.</p>

<p>Also, pretty willing to forgive that statline when he pretty much single-handedly won Game 4 of that Finals after Shaq fouled out and was the best player on the floor in Game 7 against Portland during the comeback. At 21 years old.</p>

      <label for="l74wut4" class="commentText"><p>Shaq was the better player of the two and the driver of those offenses, but Kobe has had matchups where he was more effective, like against the Spurs in the West.</p>

<p>An interesting hypothetical would be how those two would be perceived if Kobe won a FMVP or even multiple if they were playing the Spurs in the finals rather than the relatively weak final opponents they played from 2000-02.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of silly how much weight is placed in the finals and finals mvp, when I would argue the best teams the Lakers played during their run were pretty much all in the West, outside of the 2004 Pistons.</p>

<p>Basically, what I’m saying is curry’s gravity was only pronounced againt bad defensive teams that were forced to protect their big in drop by hedging (love), even still, Durant was the best player on the warriors in 2018, not 2017. Curry was hurt  in 2018</p>

<p>Also, wdym by people underrating durants  accomplishments as a reason For gravity?</p>

Kobe was oozing with talent and athleticism but his prime was probably 4-5 years after that first chip. In a low scoring era, he had that run where he scored 60+ culminating in his 81 point game.

      <label for="l7587im" class="commentText"><p>That’s what shooting guards did back then, they shot.  The idea of two wings and two stretches was started by this Celtics squad as we have two small forwards.  Think Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, JR Smith, Kobe; they were there to shoot the ball.  Small forward was there for rebounding and defense and every once in awhile a LeBron, or Larry Bird would come around.</p>

      <label for="l74x603" class="commentText"><p>I refuse to believe you watched any of the 3 peat if you think there was any “stopping” Kobe.</p>

<p>There is <em>plenty</em> of info out there about how equal they were in the playoffs. It is so obvious if you watched back then, it all lines up with the eye test. Kobe’s numbers absolutely jump off the page in the entire Western playoffs, when every team had big front courts that could give Shaq trouble. Then every year they played much smaller teams in the finals so Shaq took over. One year Kobe led the entire playoffs in Win Shares. Including Shaq.</p>

<p>Now, this is not to say I think Kobe was better/more unstoppable/more valuable. Just you guys go way too far with it, pretending it was black and white. It was always “pick your poison” and every analyst/coach recognized that they were <strong>both</strong> unstoppable, and their ceiling without each other would never have been as high.</p>
