</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Even though Thanasis Antetokounmpo isn&rsquo;t expected to play this season due a torn Achilles, the Milwaukee Bucks are considering bringing back the 32-year-old.</p>

<p>Per Spotrac&rsquo;s Keith Smith, the Bucks are trying to open a roster spot to potentially re-sign the brother of Giannis Antetokounmpo because they value his presence in the locker room.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Keith Smith</strong>@KeithSmithNBA</p>

<p>Thanasis Antetokounmpo is expected to miss the season to rehab from a torn Achilles&rsquo; tendon, but his locker room presence is prized by the Bucks, and his brother Giannis Antetokounmpo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jim Owczarski of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on May 13 that Antetokounmpo had successful surgery to repair a torn Achilles.</p>

<p>Antetokounmpo played the final three minutes of garbage time in the Bucks&rsquo; 120-98 loss in Game 6 of their first-round playoff series against the Indiana Pacers on May 2 that ended their season.</p>

<p>Per Shams Charania and Eric Nehm of The Athletic, Antetokounmpo suffered the injury during a workout in the days after the loss to Indiana.</p>

<p>NBA insider Jake Fischer reported on Saturday that the Bucks have informed teams of their interest in trading MarJon Beauchamp to potentially bring back a defensive-minded wing player.</p>

<p>Milwaukee&rsquo;s roster is currently at the maximum 15 players, not including those on Exhibit 10 and two-way contracts.</p>

<p>Beauchamp was the Bucks&rsquo; first-round draft pick (No. 24 overall) in 2022. The 24-year-old has flashed some promise, particularly as an offensive player, in limited action over the past two seasons. He shot 40.0 percent from three-point range last season, but only had 75 attempts in 48 appearances. He will make $2.7 million this season in the final guaranteed year of his rookie contract.</p>

<p>The Bucks have made a point of keeping Thanasis on their roster since it makes Giannis happy. It&rsquo;s a strategy that has served them well since Thanasis was the one who convinced his younger brother to sign a three-year, $186 million extension with the club last offseason.</p>

<p>Even though Thanasis won&rsquo;t be able to make any impact for the Bucks on the court this season due to the injury, keeping Giannis in good spirits going into a very important season for the franchise counts for a lot.</p>

<p>Thanasis has spent five seasons with the Bucks after originally signing with the team in July 2019. He has appeared in 196 games with the club, averaging 2.4 points and 1.6 rebounds per contest.</p>

The 15th man isn’t gonna play outside of garbage time anyways so who cares if it’s Thanasty, you’d think the bucks are blowing up the whole team based on people reactions lol</p>

      <label for="lsqgfxp" class="commentText"><p>Yeah it’s clearly nepotism in this case but the actual outcome of signing him to the last roster spot is no different than UD’s last few years on the Heat or Nick Collison’s last few years on the Thunder or James Jones in multiple LeBron teams, or a bunch of other examples. Guys like having him around (one very important guy in particular) and the 15th man has literally never been the difference between winning and losing a title, who cares.</p>

Thanasis literally makes Giannis play better like yeah does it suck that he takes a spot sure, but also like Giannis is a top 3 player in the league when he locked in so why would you jeopardize that for your 15th man on the bench.. its also different than the bronny situation cause 1. Thanasis was legitimately better coming in and 2. They didn’t use a draft pick on him when he woulda normally gone undrafted</p>

<p>Good locker room presence and provides a lot of energy by just being there.</p>

<p>The 15th man on the roster is very unlikely to be playing anyways so that type of guy is valuable.</p>

You watch him play and it seems like he could be really useful, all the skills are there, he’s just… Not. Just missing something, but I don’t know what.</p>

<p>He seems like a real nice guy with a good attitude and I don’t really want to give up on him entirely, especially as it was only a couple of years ago we traded Donte for crap and he’s great now, but he has been given chances and never really showed enough to really be worth hanging on to.</p>
