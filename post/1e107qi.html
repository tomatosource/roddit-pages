      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e107qi/kerr_on_being_asked_a_question_about_kumingas/"><p>Kerr on being asked a question about Kuminga&rsquo;s trade status  - &ldquo;First of all, you have to understand, there’s very few players in the league who are not talked about in trade discussions. Steph Curry is not being discussed in trade talks. Everybody else is&rdquo;</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Here’s how Kerr answered a question that began with a reference to Kuminga having survived in Golden State through his first three seasons despite a raft of trade rumors over the year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you went down the list of NBA teams, the Lakers probably are not talking to anybody about LeBron, you know? Everybody’s got maybe one or two guys who, they are off the table. So the vast majority of the players in the NBA, the players are constantly going to be discussed in trade talks, because everyone’s trying to do the same thing, which is improve their team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“With JK, we love the strides he has taken,” Kerr said. “He’s got room to grow, which is exciting. We’re working with him, he’s been great, he is having a good summer. I am excited about coaching him next year, and seeing how much better he can get.”</p>

      <label for="lctj3qp" class="commentText"><p>Dumbass take. Why does the responsibility fall on the 21 year old who has already shot 40% from 3 in large stretches when given the playing time opportunity? And not the two guys being paid 25 million dollars a year shooting sub 30% on average? Or you know the guy who shot 0/10 in the playin game?</p>

<p>And no Draymond has not become a shooter because he shot a lucky 40% from 3 on low volume for only 50 games. He&rsquo;s left wide open all the time which leads to doubling of Steph Curry every playoff game and has shot 20% from the last 5 playoffs for a reason. The guy has literally improved zero aspects of his game as he aged and is content to pick up the paycheck.</p>

His ballhandling is still rough, he has no post footwork so he can’t bully smaller mismatches, he constantly stands next to other players on offense to ruin our spacing, and his defensive rotations are either late or incorrect.  There isn’t a real fix for the warriors, the dynasty is over.  Our owner wanted two timelines so instead we ended our first timeline and lost the second completely.</p>

      <label for="lctjiin" class="commentText"><p>Kuminga averaged 30 points on high efficiency for a stretch. The guy plays with dogshit spacing and still finds a way to drive through narrow spaces. He&rsquo;s shot over 50% from midrange and 40% from 3 in those stretches. You&rsquo;re just a dogshit analyst.</p>

<p>If this just a Steph Curry effect, why is no one else on the team capable of scoring 25+ points on high efficiency? Kuminga was clearly the 2nd best scorer on the team last season and it wasn&rsquo;t even close. He just needed more than 20 minutes a game from Kerr to get into rhythm. Once Draymond came back from suspension with his shit spacing it became harder to score again and Kuminga was relegated to being an off ball cutter once again.</p>

That doesn’t make any sense. Kuminga absolutely improved his mid range game, it’s strange you’d dismiss it so vehemently.</p>

<p>Fact is, Kuminga is probably the only person besides Steph to actually be able to attack the basket offensively on a consistent basis. He’s certainly not a perfect player and has a lot of room to improve. But your assessment seems to paint him more like an out of control Kent Bazemore, which is bizzare.</p>

<p>It made the Warriors rotation decisions easier. A little less worrying about spacing if Dray isn&rsquo;t a total non-shooter.</p>

      <label for="lcs34b5" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I just don’t have any confidence that Kuminga will develop a 3 point shot, or handles, or footwork, or understanding of spacing, or defensive rotations.  The 3 point shot is the most likely because his form isn’t bad, and he could just sit in the gym until he can hit them at a good clip.  The rest are a result of him having low bbiq and slow decision making skills, and those aren’t going to substantially improve throughout his career.</p>

He hustles, he rotates properly, and he makes very, very few mistakes.  He’s a very smart player that would work well in any lineup and we just haven’t given him the playing time because of the frustrating wing logjam we have going.</p>

      <label for="lctjzoc" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s no evidence Lacob was ever obsessed with Kuminga and Moody. He spoke extremely highly and optimistically of Wiseman and no one else.</p>

<p>You probably don&rsquo;t watch any Warriors games consistently. Last season Kuminga overperformed for half the season and Steve Kerr failed to play him adequate minutes until being threatened through Charania and the media (Moody&rsquo;s frustrations also involved here). He finally gave in like the mediocre coach that he is and that&rsquo;s when Kuminga had some of his best stretches of basketball, which he had already shown in year 1 and 2 when given adequate playing time.</p>

      <label for="lcs0brl" class="commentText"><p>The two timelines was a plan from injuries from 2 of the core star players and trading KD for Wiggins and a high pick which was Kuminga. They won in 22. Extended Poole and Wiggs yet then had to go to alternate role players than the 22 team which didn’t fit as well besides Donte. </p>

<p>What did you want the FO to do trade the young guys for more role players or somehow trade then for a star? Which arguably that’s what Poole’s and Wiggins’ extensions are there for on the second option. </p>

      <label for="lcs49bw" class="commentText"><p>The two timelines was the idea that we could compete now with our aging stars and use the young draft picks as bench depth.  Unfortunately bench and out of rotation minutes are not how you develop your future.  It was a dumb idea.</p>

<p>Yes, trading the picks for veteran role players is exactly what I wanted to do.  We had a deal on the table for Myles Turner for the Wiseman pick, one for one.  None of us on the outside know much else other than the occasional tidbit we hear several years later, but yes.  I wanted veteran role players who could have helped Steph and Dray not have to carry us so hard.  I wanted us to compete while Steph was still clearly good enough to lead a contending team.  Imagine Steph’s legacy if we’d won another championship.  Instead we sacrificed the present for a future that was never guaranteed and lost both.  We do not have the makings of a contending team with this young core, as much as I like Podz, TJD, and Moody.</p>

      <label for="lcs87hj" class="commentText"><p>The Wiseman pick and stash is the worst move they did. Especially after injuries and a rough rookie year. When was that trade offered in his rookie year? Although Myles was off and on with injuries as well. But I feel like your move has some minuses too you’d prefer the latter half of the team to be filled with upper role players hopefully meanwhile the top 7-8 players are good/great players for their fit.</p>

<p> I think no matter what the team would be kinda top heavy due to Wiggs and Poole getting extended.  I guess my point is I think the latter half of the team would be either the young core we have now or older vets/MLE/minimum guys. Older vets can go both ways if you compare the vets from 22 and 23. The reason the team is bad is the core starters isn’t great and your moves don’t help the upper half of the team</p>

      <label for="lcsy79c" class="commentText"><p>He looks great in the post to me. His ballhandling isn’t excellent, but you can see he’s well coached-his style is like prime Jason Richardson where he either shoots it, attacks in a straight line to the basket, or uses a quick lateral move with two dribbles to shoot the midrange shot. Everything is based on a quick decision to get the first step on the defender, then letting his athleticism and finishing ability take over. So the lack of ballhandling hurts his game a lot less because of his style of play.</p>

<p>Other than those attacks, it’s all just post game. Which he also doesn’t need elite handles for.</p>

      <label for="lct8yof" class="commentText"><p>I gotta say…I don’t know who you’re watching but it’s not JK.  There is no decision when he receives the ball.  It absolutely is straight line to the basket.  He doesn’t even fake a 3 point shot, not that anyone would close out on it.  His mid range shot doesn’t fall, and half of them are fadeaways because he made no headway trying to back down the smaller defender.</p>

<p>The truth is he’s never going to be a superstar.  He just won’t, he doesn’t have the quick thinking for it.  He doesn’t have the bbiq for it.  But let’s say he gets on the Steph ballhandling workout.  Let’s say he sits in the gym until he hits fadeaways at a good clip.  Let’s say he can knock down a 3 pt shoy above 37% on good volume.  Let’s say he puts on a little muscle to absorb contact on finishes and somehow develops finesse he doesn’t have for those finishes he can’t just dunk.  Let’s say he goes to Hakeem Olajuwon’s summer workout and develops post footwork.  Let’s say he has Kobe work ethic and improved every skill he possibly can to the logical limit.  He still thinks slowly.  He still does not see passing lanes.  He still does not understand how to read a defense and attack it accordingly.  He is constantly out of position when he doesn’t have the ball.  He does not know how to rotate when he’s on defense either.  He gives up more open 3’s than anyone on the team because he can’t see where he’s supposed to rotate in advance.  He is the most hyper athletic player on a team that includes Andrew Wiggins and he is still late to every close out.</p>

<p>He just isn’t that guy.  He’s not the now, he’s not the future.  And the dubs should get rid of him before the rest of the league realizes it.</p>

      <label for="lcsnnjw" class="commentText"><p>Monta was traded in early 2012 for Bogut.  So maybe around 2011</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember any real rumors that weren&rsquo;t just talk radio crap, but it might have happened.  Curry was clearly untouchable by the middle of the 2012-2013 season.</p>
