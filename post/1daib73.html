    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The other day, I noticed that Kobe and LeBron played against almost the same opponents in the playoffs from 2007 to 2012, and I wanted to compare their stats. Here are the numbers:</p>

<p>I wish Kobe could have played in the 2013 Spurs series so we could compare that as well.</p>

<p><strong>Lebron vs Spurs 2007:</strong> 22.0 points / 7.0 rebounds / 6.8 assists / 35% fg / 42% ts / 37% efg<br>
<strong>Kobe vs Spurs 2008:</strong>    29.2 points / 5.6 rebounds / 3.8 assists / 53% fg / 58% ts / 56% efg</p>

<p><strong>Lebron vs Celtics 2008:</strong> 26.7 points / 6.4 rebounds / 7.6 assists / 35% fg / 48% ts / 38% efg<br>
<strong>Kobe vs Celtics 2008:</strong>    25.7 points / 4.7 rebounds / 5.0 assists / 40% fg / 50% ts / 43% efg</p>

<p><strong>Lebron vs Magic 2009:</strong> 38.5 points / 8.3 rebounds / 8.0 assists / 48% fg / 59% ts / 52% efg<br>
<strong>Kobe vs Magic 2009:</strong>    32.4 points / 5.6 rebounds / 7.4 assists / 43% fg / 52% ts / 46% efg</p>

<p><strong>Lebron vs Celtics 2010:</strong> 26.8 points / 9.3 rebounds / 7.2 assists / 44% fg / 55% ts / 47% efg<br>
<strong>Kobe vs Celtics 2010:</strong>    28.6 points / 8.0 rebounds / 3.9 assists / 40% fg / 52% ts / 45% efg</p>

<p><strong>Lebron vs Mavs 2011:</strong>    17.8 points / 7.2 rebounds / 6.8 assists / 47% fg / 54% ts / 52% efg<br>
<strong>Kobe vs Mavs 2011:</strong>       23.3 points / 3.0 rebounds / 2.5 assists / 45% fg / 51% ts / 48% efg</p>

<p>Not to mention they had Bruce Bowen, who made 1st team all defense that year guarding Kobe.</p>

<p>Bill Simmons said that series was the closest he&rsquo;s ever seen Kobe to Michael Jordan.</p>

      <label for="l7ld8py" class="commentText"><p>If you watch that series, the incredible thing is that Kobe identified Duncan as the weakness in the Spurs defense against him, and repeatedly victimized Duncan by getting him switched onto him and then either driving right past him or just hitting pullups over him. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/5aXVxcLm2qQ?t=263" target="_blank">the 4th quarter of Game 5,</a> and it&rsquo;s just one possession after another of Kobe running pick and roll with Pau to get Bowen switched off of him and onto Pau so Kobe could pick apart Duncan going one on one against him, and he scored every time.</p>

<p>Seeing Rudy Gobert get similarly targeted by smaller players in their series against Dallas reminded me a lot of Kobe doing this to Duncan: both incredible defenders who&rsquo;s weakness is not being able to switch out on the perimeter. This happens a lot more nowadays (see Gobert), but Kobe was really ahead of his time in doing this with such a quality defender in Duncan back in 2008.</p>

<p>Bruce was never actually all that amazing on ball, he was fantastic at navigating screens and denying but he didn&rsquo;t have the size, strength or speed to handle great guards whilst Kawhi used to make CP3 and Steph look like kids at times by taking the ball away on their dribble which is insane.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the Lakers were missing starters Andrew Bynum and Trevor Ariza for this series. Manu may have been hurting, but he was still healthy enough to play his usual minutes in every game of the series. Kobe also was playing with a fractured finger on his dominant hand in this series.</p>

Bowen was far from his peak as a defender in 08.</p>

      <label for="l7ldp0j" class="commentText"><p>I think, historically, we should probably celebrate Lebron&rsquo;s first stint with the Cavs as being way more successful than you could honestly expect. Unlike future Lebron squads, they had basically no other all nba player. The team was devoid of capable ball handlers and way too many minutes went to guys who would get played off the court on team&rsquo;s with better rosters.</p>

<p>It was truly the Lebron show and everyone knew it.</p>

Still, the strength of that Cavs team is all KD needs to justify his choice. If you’re gonna move to any other team that will eventually have to face the 2017 Cavs, why would you pick anyone other than the warriors</p>

      <label for="l7mww6g" class="commentText"><p>Can anyone turn Non-Shooters into shooters? Poor defenders into good defenders? Or poor ball handlers into successful ones?</p>

<p>We also saw the limits of a LeBron only team in the 2015 finals. Maybe Matthew Delavadola can fake it for a couple games but eventually that catches up with you.</p>

<p>As for LeBron vs Kobe&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just admit I&rsquo;m one of those people who doesn&rsquo;t really think Kobe belongs in the same conversation as LeBron. That doesn&rsquo;t mean Kobe isn&rsquo;t an all time great and one of the premier players of his generation. But outside of perhaps 3 pt shooting and iso one on one bucket getting, there&rsquo;s nothing Kobe does that LeBron isn&rsquo;t better at. He&rsquo;s a better playmaker. A more efficient usage heavy player. He is a better and more switchable defender. A better rebounder. Better in transition. A better orchestrator of offense in the half court set. His efficiency suggests he&rsquo;s a far better one-on-one player than Kobe, even though that&rsquo;s what Kobe is known for. Other than having a 1 ring advantage, I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s left.</p>

      <label for="l7ladur" class="commentText"><p>Why didn&rsquo;t op include Kobe vs 04 Pistons and LeBron vs 06 Pistons then?</p>

<p>Kobe vs Pistons 2004: 22.6 pts / 2.8 reb / 4.4 ast / 38.1% FG / 45.6% TS<br>
LeBron vs Pistons 2006: 26.6 pts / 8.6 reb / 6.0 ast / 44.2% FG / 51.6% TS</p>

<p>Kobe stans are pathetic, pick and choose stats to make Kobe looks better, but somehow he still looks worse than LeBron</p>

      <label for="l7ktu0x" class="commentText"><p>Kobe did vastly better against the Spurs. That was a matchup where they couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of Tim Duncan&rsquo;s rim protection to deter Kobe whereas they could against Lebron. That&rsquo;s why he struggled. Lebron was overall more efficient against every opponent except the Celtics in 2008 and the Mavs. I don&rsquo;t blame Lebron for that 2009 Magic loss. I&rsquo;ve gone back and rewatched. There&rsquo;s a stark comparison with Gasol/Odom defending Dwight and their wings compared to Varejao/Big Z scrambling to recover after double teaming Dwight. I feel Gasol taking on that Dwight matchup gets underrated</p>

<p>2007 - 2011 Bron are his worst years in the post season as he just entered the league getting his bearings and honing his skills.</p>

<p>2007 - 2011 Kobe is also on the tail end of his prime, on his way out.</p>

<p>It would be better to compare 2012 -2018 Lebron and 2002-2010 Kobe</p>

      <label for="l7kzlde" class="commentText"><p>Considering Phil&rsquo;s philosophy that guards should be ready for transition as soon as a shot goes up and bigs should rebound makes rebound comparison even more pointless. Phil made it so Kobes job specifically was to avoid rebounds and work on slowing transitions down defensively or running the court to get easy buckets. Most of Kobes rebounds come from either him directly defending his guy missing or getting his own rebounds. Rarely does he go in to get his teammates rebounds or his teammates defensive assignments rebounds while under Phil Jackson.</p>

<p>I would rather have 26 points with the game winner instead of 28 from LeBron where he passes, and they lose the game.</p>

<p>Kobe had a killer instinct to win the game.</p>

<p>So again, 2 players can have the same stats but 1 player has the more impactful minutes and buckets… they aren’t the same.</p>

<p>It is a legitimate argument and one that will forever stand the test of time between Kobe and LeBron.</p>

<p>If the game is on the line, 8 seconds left, I’m choosing Kobe to have the ball in his hands to win the ring, not LeBron.</p>

<p>Someone made an extensive breakdown video on YouTube with this exact same topic.</p>

<p>Check it out for yourself.</p>

      <label for="l7kl97g" class="commentText"><p>Lebrons team sucked pretty much. He had to do everything and that was exaggerated against those Celtics and Spurs who were historic Ds in 08 and 07.</p>

<p>Bryant had a very good team around him, especially in 2010 when Pau Gasol was actually ahead of him in win shares in those playoffs. Not a perfect metric but shows the strength of his supporting cast.</p>

<p>Artest, Odom, Bynum, Fisher is really really strong.</p>

      <label for="l7kogkr" class="commentText"><p>I think people really undersell how good of a how supporting cast the Lakers/Kobe had from 2008-10.</p>

<p>Pau/Bynum/Odom is an extremely versatile front court on both ends. Even more so for that time. Kobe was great during those years but if you watch the games the difference in their front court compared to others was clear. Most of the time the commentators who aren’t perfect but give good glimpses of what people thought at the time gush over how great a FC they have.</p>

      <label for="l7lex27" class="commentText"><p>It should be pointed out that Pau and Bynum didn&rsquo;t play together until the 2008-09 season. The supporting cast in the 2008 playoffs wasn&rsquo;t nearly as great as it was in 2009 &amp; 2010, with both Bynum and Ariza out for the 2008 playoffs. Having Bynum in 2009 and 2010, and Ariza for 2009 and then Artest for 2010 made a massive difference for the Lakers.</p>

Tristian Thompson played 30 mins a game and averaged 7.7 points on 56% shooting and 8.5 rebounds. I never hear anyone talk about how great TT was yet they had similar impact.</p>

<p>For even better comparison. In 2015 playoffs Timothy Mosgov started 20 games and played 26 mins a game averaging 10.6 points on 50% shooting and 7.3 rebounds. Yet all I hear is Lebron had no help but Bynum was such a great supporting cast. FOH.</p>

<p>Andrew Bynum in the 2 title runs played 20 mins a game and averaged 7.4 points on 50% shooting and 5.3 rebounds. Haslem played 18 mins and averaged 5 points and 5 rebounds a game on 52% shooting during the 2 title runs.</p>

      <label for="l7ln1gy" class="commentText"><p>comparing stats is useless because there is no nuance allowed. injuries,  coaching schemes, teamates, position. and role in the offense and defense, etc is all important. context is important. so i understand its easier to digest like a cavemen and compare numbers, but its useless. but whatever, live your life simple jack</p>

      <label for="l7loedt" class="commentText"><p>I understand context and we aren&rsquo;t comparing Kareem and Ant. Careers for Bron and Kobe overlapped by 13 years. Regardless, Bron beats Kobe when you adjust for eras too(even though like I said, a lot of their careers overlap). Bron is top 3 all time. Kobe is top 10. Each player&rsquo;s role matters too lmao. The stats accounting for that is fine. With injuries, people always say availabilty is the best ability. They were both great defenders, Bron better on the interior and Kobe better on the perimeter. But Bron was a better scorer, playmaker, rebounder, etc. Keep acting like ur einstein bud</p>

      <label for="l7lp9j6" class="commentText"><p>you are simply wrong.  lebron has more assists or playmaking game time because that was his role. kobe was a scorer and his job qas to put pressure on the defense within the triangle.  kobe was a playmaker for a short period due to injuries to d fish and he averaged 10 assists more or less around that time. if his role would be playmaking, he was doing just that on a high level just like bron</p>

<p>thats just one example with playmaking</p>

<p>again, context,  but im tired man think whatever the fuck you want bye</p>

      <label for="l7mdee0" class="commentText"><p>LeBron may have had some advantages, but don’t act like Kobe wasn’t right there with him. LeBron&rsquo;s scoring titles? None. Kobe? Two-time scoring champ. Kobe dropped 81 in a game. Bron hasn’t come close. Longevity? Sure, LeBron’s got it, but Kobe played through more injuries and still dominated. Career overlap? Yeah, LeBron had help from the start. Kobe carried Smush Parker and Kwame Brown to the playoffs. Kobe was a 12-time All-Defensive Team member. LeBron has five. Kobe’s defensive IQ and footwork on the perimeter were elite. LeBron can block shots but gets caught ball-watching on D.</p>

<p>Playmaking? LeBron’s great, no doubt. Kobe? Averages over 5 assists per game in the triangle offense where sharing the ball is mandatory. Kobe’s rebounding? Not his main role, yet he still grabbed crucial boards, especially in the Finals. Kobe played through broken fingers, knees, and an Achilles tear, showing he’s tougher than most. Stats adjusted for eras? Kobe’s facing tougher defenses with hand-checking and fewer spacing advantages. Top 10? More like top 5. Five rings, two Finals MVPs, and the greatest scorer of all time’s endorsement (MJ). Kobe’s legacy is sealed. Keep those &ldquo;advanced stats&rdquo; coming, doesn&rsquo;t change the fact Kobe’s a legend in every era.</p>

      <label for="l7kymgx" class="commentText"><p>How is LeBron better exactly? Kobe brought the defense further out. Kobe played in the triangle and under specific rules set for the team. Kobe being the initial ball handler most of the time also means he isn&rsquo;t going to rack up assists being it is on the person he passes to to make decisions, which was often a pass back to Kobe ready to attack. Also Phil&rsquo;s philosophy for 2000s ball, guards were supposed to always be ready for transition defense/offense, bigs and wings were to rebound.</p>

<p>The fact that Kobe was discipline to coaches instructions means he is worse? Both players played under insanely different systems, comparing them by stats really is pointless. Who won more with less is the bigger indicator of greatness imo.</p>

      <label for="l7leiw2" class="commentText"><p>As someone who was older than Kobe and watched both guys their entire careers, I&rsquo;d agree with your assessment. Kobe was better than LeBron for a while, then LeBron overtook Kobe, and LeBron&rsquo;s peak was higher than Kobe&rsquo;s was. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any question that LeBron is higher on anyone&rsquo;s all time list, as he&rsquo;s top 3 at worst, while Kobe is closer to 7-10 probably.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that tho. Kobe&rsquo;s teammates played like a bunch bums against the Spurs. They were also missing Trevor Ariza and Andrew Bynum to injury and Kobe still dominated the defending champs.</p>
