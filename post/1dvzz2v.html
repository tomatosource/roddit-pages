      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dvzz2v/were_the_20082010_cavs_supporting_cast_really/"><p>Were the 2008-2010 Cavs supporting cast really THAT bad?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>All the time people say &ldquo;LeBron had one of the worst supporting casts of all time&rdquo; and his first stint Cavs were absolutely horrible. But how can that be? They had the best record in the league for two straight years if not three (misremembering). Were they really THAT bad?</p>

<p>Okay sure, it is true that LeBron was the only superstar on that team but the Cavs were not unique in that situation then. Remember it was a different time then. Most teams had just one superstar and having more than one was not common then. Dwight Howard was the only superstar on the Magic. Dwyane Wade was the only star on the Heat. You will probably say &ldquo;but what about the Lakers and the Celtics then?&rdquo; but they were the exception rather than the rule. Even if you look at the NBA today, if the Sixers for example lose Embiid they are also toast! The whole &ldquo;this player is carrying the whole team&rdquo; statement is imo misleading or if you are going to say it then you need to concede that that is true for every team then that has a superstar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh but if you take LeBron away from that team that team is suddenly the worst team in the NBA.&rdquo; Sure but that could have been said about most other teams back then with a star! Lose Wade and the heat were also doomed. Same with the Magic if they lost Dwight. The team was built around Lebron imo, rather than &ldquo;LeBron carried that team on his back.&rdquo; The Cavs actually did an excellent job imo of surrounding an excellent passer and driver in LeBron with excellent role players who were able to shoot the 3, such as Mo Williams and Delonte West. Yes, it is true that they lacked a capable big man and way past their prime old men Shaq and Big Z were not going to cut it, but I think it&rsquo;s a fair criticism that LeBron jumped ship before they were able to complete the team and get to the championship. If they had gotten a good center there is no doubt in my mind the Cavs would have won the championship with that team.</p>

      <label for="lbr4zn6" class="commentText"><p>Lebron didn’t have the recruiting power he had in his second stint with the Cavs, and it was harder for him to convince guys to come to Cleveland.</p>

<p>Plus he made them too good too fast and they never got another good pick in a draft to pair Lebron with.</p>

      <label for="lbr4dvf" class="commentText"><p>Was definitely not a consistent championship level support cast even for that era.</p>

<p>Lakers had Odom, Pau, Bynum, Artest</p>

<p>Spurs had Parker, Manu, Bowen</p>

<p>Celtics had Pierce, Rondo, Allen, Posey, Perkins</p>

<p>Suns had Amare, Marion, Bell, Barbosa, Diaw</p>

<p>Mavs had Caron Butler, Terry, Kidd, Marion, Howard</p>

      <label for="lbr6c7y" class="commentText"><p>Came here to say this. Add the Rockets (McGrady had Yao and Artest) and Hornets (Chris Paul had David West and Tyson Chandler and Peja) and Jazz (D Will had Boozer and Kirilenko and Millsap)</p>

<p>Cavs didn’t have a top…12? supporting cast, yet LeBron gave them the best record for multiple seasons plus multiple deep playoff runs. No other star in that era could’ve done that.</p>

<p>Kobe sucked. So did KG and Nash. Dirk was awful. None worth mentioning.</p>

<p>That was history being re written as lebron fans would like to amplify his greatness, but that gets done for quite few players in every generation, even couple of top players today are said as sole carriers of the team which is simply not true</p>

      <label for="lbr5s6d" class="commentText"><p>They didn’t have a good enough no 2, the other rotational players were solid. It’s kinda the lakers and Kobe post shaq, before Kobe showed up. Lakers in 08 had more quality role players imo but still, just needed a no 2 to boost them appropriately . Mo Williams was a good no 3</p>

<p>those teams won 66 and 61 games those 2 years.</p>

<p>how can you win 66 games with the worst supporting cast ever?</p>

<p>you can&rsquo;t</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s revisionist excuse making. nothing more.</p>
