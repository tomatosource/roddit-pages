</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Think Dame had a better season than some of the naysayers have said he did, his defense by the numbers was not as bad as the narrative. If you really comb through the defensive numbers, he was not awful on defense last year. His season was still an adventure with some big swings in performance, peaks and valleys, offensively it was a bit of a weird season for Dame, TS% lower than usual, but not dramatically outside his norms.</p>

<p>He got into 73 games which is a good number, but suffered through more leg issues, worryingly an achilles late in the season. He&rsquo;s had all kinds of leg injuries the last several seasons and is 34 now, but offensively he remains an elite player, and you would imagine with a normal offseason and more ability to acclimate under Doc and Giannis that he can have a more consistent season coming up.</p>

<p>What are your expectations for Damian Lillard going into <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>?</p>

Just overall kinda crazy season but it is what it is. The biggest problem from an on court perspective was him deferring too much.

      <label for="lf2af5p" class="commentText"><p>As the season went on they tried to get Dame to run the half court more and more. This was especially emphasized once Doc took over. They talked about this quite a lot in their pressers and interviews. I agree with you that Giannis had too much usage and was the primary guy too often. The team also recognized and acknowledged this. They weren&rsquo;t able to completely fix it during the season. It takes some time to figure out how to make it happen in game. They tried a bunch of different things under Doc to try and push Dame into it as much as possible. It did get better toward the end of the year but its not to where it needs to be.</p>

      <label for="lf21ub1" class="commentText"><p>Dame is consistently underrated. Even in a bad year, his TS was elite. In terms of free throw efficiency and volume, he’s arguably the best ever in that regard. I expect to see somewhere around 27-7-4 with TS around 62-63. It’s hard to imagine he won’t be better than last year.</p>

<p>He gets an actual offseason with the team.</p>

<p>Giannis is getting better at setting screens. Earlier on, Giannis’ screens were straight up terrible.</p>

<p>He gets more playtime with Khris. Khris has a bad habit of playing iso ball and hunting for Giannis. This often led to Dame being iced out and treated like Beasley #2.</p>

<p>He has a coach that actually runs plays through him. Griffin treated Beasley like he was on the same playing field as Dame. And Griffin kept leaning on Giannis.</p>

<p>Having more size at the 2 should allow Dame to focus more energy on offense. Dame had to rely on Malik Beasley playing poa defense and it was pathetic. Dame is not even a bad defender, he’s pretty average but was expected to be elite. You don’t see prime Steph, harden, etc putting the clamps on ppl, that was other players’ jobs.</p>

<p>Dame is a horrible defender and has been his entire career. He didn’t suddenly figure out defense at age 33 - and I’d be super skeptical of any metric that says he did.</p>

<p>But we all knew that already. The bigger issue is Dame is likely going to further decline on offense. He’s 34 now and this may be the Bucks last shot with Dame at an All-Star level, if he even still is that.</p>

<p>I will add though - I don’t think Dame make or breaks this team this season. Much bigger concerns with health/age/depth throughout the rotation.</p>

<p>There are. He had his best D-EPM ever last year, slightly above average at 0.9.  Every other year he was significantly below average.</p>

      <label for="lf2552l" class="commentText"><p>I love Dame but I got low expectations for the Bucks, they just don’t have anyone who can play defense to make up for his deficiencies. I wouldn’t be surprised if he has a much better season, but as a team I just don’t think they got any better compared to the rest of the East</p>

Since the offensive load is only going to reduce, his defense will improve but only marginally. Watch for him taking more charges this year.</p>

<p>He can still shoot at elite level for 2 more seasons max, hopefully everyone else is healthy and dame/giannis chemistry improves, that should be enough to be a top contender</p>

The real question is are Giannis, Dame, and Khris able to overcome Doc sabotaging the team like he did last season?</p>
