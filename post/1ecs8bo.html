</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Think Dame had a better season than some of the naysayers have said he did, his defense by the numbers was not as bad as the narrative. If you really comb through the defensive numbers, he was not awful on defense last year. His season was still an adventure with some big swings in performance, peaks and valleys, offensively it was a bit of a weird season for Dame, TS% lower than usual, but not dramatically outside his norms.</p>

<p>He got into 73 games which is a good number, but suffered through more leg issues, worryingly an achilles late in the season. He&rsquo;s had all kinds of leg injuries the last several seasons and is 34 now, but offensively he remains an elite player, and you would imagine with a normal offseason and more ability to acclimate under Doc and Giannis that he can have a more consistent season coming up.</p>

<p>What are your expectations for Damian Lillard going into <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>?</p>

      <label for="lf25akl" class="commentText"><p>yeah, and he came into the season super out of shape, and obviously there was all the coaching stuff going on. Just overall kinda crazy season but it is what it is. The biggest problem from an on court perspective was him deferring too much.

      <label for="lf2af5p" class="commentText"><p>As the season went on they tried to get Dame to run the half court more and more. This was especially emphasized once Doc took over. They talked about this quite a lot in their pressers and interviews. I agree with you that Giannis had too much usage and was the primary guy too often. The team also recognized and acknowledged this. They weren&rsquo;t able to completely fix it during the season. It takes some time to figure out how to make it happen in game. They tried a bunch of different things under Doc to try and push Dame into it as much as possible. It did get better toward the end of the year but its not to where it needs to be.</p>

It seemed like Dame was worried about &ldquo;taking over&rdquo; Giannis&rsquo; team but the reality is they will only go as far as Dame can take them in the half-court. The entire reason they brought him in was to fix their putrid half-court offense so he really needs to just take the reigns and be the dude running things.</p>

      <label for="lf21ub1" class="commentText"><p>Dame is consistently underrated. Even in a bad year, his TS was elite. In terms of free throw efficiency and volume, he’s arguably the best ever in that regard. I expect to see somewhere around 27-7-4 with TS around 62-63. It’s hard to imagine he won’t be better than last year.</p>

<p>He gets an actual offseason with the team.</p>

<p>Giannis is getting better at setting screens. Earlier on, Giannis’ screens were straight up terrible.</p>

<p>He gets more playtime with Khris. Khris has a bad habit of playing iso ball and hunting for Giannis. This often led to Dame being iced out and treated like Beasley #2.</p>

<p>He has a coach that actually runs plays through him. Griffin treated Beasley like he was on the same playing field as Dame. And Griffin kept leaning on Giannis.</p>

<p>Having more size at the 2 should allow Dame to focus more energy on offense. Dame had to rely on Malik Beasley playing poa defense and it was pathetic. Dame is not even a bad defender, he’s pretty average but was expected to be elite. You don’t see prime Steph, harden, etc putting the clamps on ppl, that was other players’ jobs.</p>

<p>Dame is a horrible defender and has been his entire career. He didn’t suddenly figure out defense at age 33 - and I’d be super skeptical of any metric that says he did.</p>

<p>But we all knew that already. The bigger issue is Dame is likely going to further decline on offense. He’s 34 now and this may be the Bucks last shot with Dame at an All-Star level, if he even still is that.</p>

<p>I will add though - I don’t think Dame make or breaks this team this season. Much bigger concerns with health/age/depth throughout the rotation.</p>

<p>There are. He had his best D-EPM ever last year, slightly above average at 0.9.  Every other year he was significantly below average.</p>

<p>I bet you we see a Dame much closer to his normal self.</p>

<p>D-EPM and defensive metrics by and large heavily factor in team performance because individual performance isn’t quantifiable nearly as much as it is for O-EPM, and just because D-EPM is slightly better than D-LEBRON doesn’t mean anything lol</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, d-epm absolutely does not lol. You say &ldquo;and defensive metrics&rdquo;.  Some do, some don&rsquo;t.  Individual defensive rating for instance is a team stat.  DARKO and EPM however, are not raw plus minus stats.  They exist to isolate individual player performance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why link something that does nothing to explain how it’s calculated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I linked the wrong page lol.  <a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/about/epm" target="_blank">This is the one I meant to</a>.  Pertinent parts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You may have noticed a pattern above with the players mentioned that many with high plus-minus happen to play alongside really great players on good teams (Caldwell-Pope next to Nikola Jokic, Cedi Osman and Isaac Okoro on a great Cavs team, etc.). This illustrates that one of the major problems with raw plus-minus is that it is blind to context&ndash;it is not aware of bias due to who players are playing with (or against for that matter). As will be discussed later, this is largely mitigated with a longstanding technique of adjusted plus-minus (APM), which EPM utilizes.</p>

<p>his also means that maxing out the variance explained in model building (r-squared) was not the goal; for example, EPM does not use team-level stats such as a player&rsquo;s &ldquo;offensive rating&rdquo; (which is really just team rating while the player is on the floor), because although it would increase r-squared, and would also help match what the team was doing (well, because it is a team-level stat), it would introduce an overfitted team effect into the model that decreased the accuracy in measuring player impact.</p>

<p>EPM uses mostly possession-based stats derived from play-by-play data so that possessions can be counted rather than estimated when calculating the stats. This means inputs into the model were as accurate as possible. Calculating possession-based stats before play-by-play data required possessions to be estimated so EPM is only calculated for the modern era as of this time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is saying it&rsquo;s perfect, but it&rsquo;s widely regarded as one of the best all-in-one stats and saying it&rsquo;s &ldquo;almost entirely a team stat&rdquo; is total bullshit.</p>
