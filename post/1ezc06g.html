<p>But the next batch of superstars that might flirt with those names in the list are all international players</p>

<p><strong>Next Batch of Names that might be in consideration</strong></p>

<p>Joker (3x MVP, 1 FMVP)</p>

<p>Giannis (2x MVP, 1 FMVP, 1 DPOY)</p>

<p>Luka (5 All Nba First Team Selections at age 25)</p>

<p>Wemby (projected to be the next gen superstar when he reach his prime)</p>

They always were able to retool their role players to maximize their defense and 3pt shooting. Kobe on the other hand went through numerous coaches, had some wildly bad teams between losing Shaq and getting Pau.</p>

      <label for="ljlrk8b" class="commentText"><p>Why do people make it seem like Kobe only played with scrubs and Duncan only played with the most stacked rosters? The late 90s/early 2000s, Duncan didn’t really have much help - David Robinson was aging and Manu/Tony were still coming into their own. The late 2000s Spurs also had some pretty mediocre teams and Timmy had knee issues that made those years forgettable.</p>

<p>Kobe had fucking Shaq. This can’t be overstated enough. Shaq had one of the most dominant primes ever, if not the most dominant. Give Duncan MJ or LeBron in their prime and we’re probably talking at minimum 8 rings. And yes the Kobe Lakers had some coaching turmoil but that was really only during the years were he had bad rosters or had his Achilles injury and was pretty much out of contention as a top player. He had PJ for all 5 of his chips. And mind you, a lot of that coaching turnover and turmoil was driven by Kobe. Losing Shaq was also Kobe-driven.</p>

<p>Duncan is is credited with being a major factor in establishing the Spurs culture and enabling Pop and the franchise to be stable and consistent.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t ever catch Duncan on video talking about shipping his young teammates out for vets like Kobe did with Bynum</p>

<p>Yeah, this is the way I have it too.  Like, it&rsquo;s hard to differentiate between someone like say Steph Curry and Bill Russell given how different their games were and how different basketball was during their eras.  So I have them in a rough tier, which would roughly be like ranks 4 - 12.  Push comes to shove I&rsquo;d have him on the lower end of that tier, but I could absolutely see the argument for having him higher.</p>

<p>But end of the day, saying it&rsquo;s unanimous is crazy.</p>

<p>Ask any player, coach, or expert on basketball and you&rsquo;d be laughed at out of the room for not putting him in the top 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really.  Lots of lists do not have him top 10 at all, and many of those that do have him borderline (9th or 10th).  And lots of people believe Steph is going to be top 10, which logically means many lists drop Kobe into 11.</p>

<p>A fair amount of rules do have him top 10, but pretending it&rsquo;s &lsquo;pretty unanimous&rsquo; is silly.</p>

<p>As an illustration, the Athletic did a feature a few years back on the top 75 players of all time, with their panel of writers submitting their lists.  <a href="https://archive.md/TRODS#selection-1531.0-1627.9" target="_blank">This is a non-paywalled site showing all of their writers&rsquo; lists</a>.  While in the combined list, Kobe ended up 10th all time, many of the writer&rsquo;s lists do not have Kobe in the top 10.  And I don&rsquo;t think any have him top 5.</p>

<p>And again, this is from years ago, and Steph&rsquo;s won a title and had a couple good years since then.  Not unreasonable to believe Steph moves up into the top 10, and Kobe slides down out of it.</p>

<p>And before you try that BS, I&rsquo;m not claiming that listing of Athletic writers is the be all and end all - it&rsquo;s simply an illustration that it is not unanimous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can debate where in the top 10 you put him, but outside of that is not debatable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You very much do not make the rules for this.  Thankfully.</p>

      <label for="ljjt7wy" class="commentText"><p>Top 4: Bron, MJ, Kareem, Bill.</p>

<p>Next 2: Magic and Bird</p>

<p>Top 6 are pretty set in stone. Then you have Shaq, Wilt, Timmy, Kobe, Steph, and Hakeem (others may include more, I&rsquo;m just going with the obvious guys), and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unreasonable to have 4 of those dudes above Kobe. You can subjectively list those guys in almost any order depending on how you value peak vs longevity</p>

      <label for="ljkpgsr" class="commentText"><p>If you’re going to discount his first three rings because of Shaq, then we have to go through all the top 10 players and start weighing the value of each ring. You have to be consistent across the board. Some players won rings on stacked teams, others were way way better than their supporting rosters.</p>

<p>Then you have to look at the level of competition. If some rings are against easier conferences, should they “count as much” as rings won against more elite teams?</p>

<p>My point is that this is extremely subjective.</p>

<p>I mean&hellip; Yeah you kinda do need to look at each case individually if you want the list to mean anything.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking solely at accolades and not bothering to look deeper, Bill Russell is the clear GOAT.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the need to look at each case beyond just what they have in their trophy cases.</p>

      <label for="ljkx130" class="commentText"><p>People don’t look at each case individually though. That’s why it’s heavily biased. And how closely you look is also subjective and biased. Will you weigh Duncan’s ‘99 ring less because it was a 1A/1B situation rather than him being the definitive favorite ina shortened season without many title ready teams? What about the 87 Lakers who beat a joke of a western conference? What about Hakeem’s rings which were back to back with less help against prime competition? Should these two rings be weighed more?</p>

      <label for="ljky3dp" class="commentText"><p>It’s simple: add as much context as you feel you need to based on how much you like the player</p>

<p>For instance, I’ve just decided that I don’t like Magic, so I’m going to say that he’s outside of the top 10 because he had Kareem for all of his rings.  But now I don’t like Kareem either, so his rings don’t count because he had Magic for five of them.  And now that I’ve devalued Magic and Kareem, I can begin pushing my true agenda: James Worthy is a top ten player of all time</p>

One of the most successful players of all time, and a great defender (15x all defense). Jokic has a looooooooong way to go before he’s there, same with Kobe and Steph. Their resumes are just flat out better right now. I think you’re a prisoner of the moment tbh lol</p>

      <label for="ljlcv84" class="commentText"><p>Tbh, I’m firmly of the belief that Duncan is a tier above Steph and Kobe and that Jokic isn’t there yet, but I do believe he has a great argument for being in the same tier as those two. In terms of regular season resumes, Jokic already clears them in everything but longevity. Both have several more titles than him, but they also had far stronger supporting casts throughout their careers. The one season Jokic had a good team around him so far, they won a title in dominant fashion</p>

      <label for="ljldrf3" class="commentText"><p>I think there are more factors than just having a good team around you. He had a good team last year too, did they not always play great? No, but that could’ve happened the year before too. Steph and Kobe do have longevity but that sounds disingenuous. Several more years of deep playoff runs and titles is vastly more impressive to me than “he had a good team and won once! So he’s on track to be better!”</p>

<p>Steph also changed the game of basketball and has 2 MVPs, one being unanimous. Kobe was also a great defender which Jokic is not and will never be.</p>

      <label for="ljlg1le" class="commentText"><p>Jokic is fairly clearly the best player in the world right now, has been for a couple year at least, and looks like he will be for at least a couple more. I’m not sure Steph or Kobe ever were, and certainly never were by the same margin as Jokic. The Nuggets were <em>good</em> last year, but every season Steph or Kobe won titles, they had amazing teams not just good ones. You could even argue that they weren’t the best players on their teams for several of their titles (a certainty in Kobe’s case)</p>

      <label for="ljmi2bd" class="commentText"><p>Fair point but I think you could definitely argue a few players are on his level, he hasn’t been far and away the best player every year imo. Giannis is definitely on his level the last few years, and I personally thought a Luka should’ve won MVP this year with the crazy stats and performances he had.</p>

<p>If the Nuggets win 3 more rings with this core they’ll go down as a great team, and guys like AG and MPJ’s stock will rise and will be well known for years. obviously the lakers and warriors had a dynasty with some big names, so I don’t think that’s a fair comparison to this Nuggets team that just got started.
However I will say the 2022 warriors was an absolutely carry job by Steph with Andrew fucking Wiggins being the second best player on that team lol</p>

      <label for="ljlha9x" class="commentText"><p>We just had 6 different champs in 6 years. Only the warriors and celtic even got to two finals in that timespan. The league is very competetive, especially in the west. I don&rsquo;t think we will see teams winning consistently like the Warriors or the Spurs did for the forseeable future. So, what does that do to rings in this individual accolade discussion?</p>

<p>I think the top 8ish are for the most part undisputed. MJ or Lebron, then Russell, then in no particular order Duncan, Kareem, Wilt, Bird, Magic. Steph, Shaq, Kobe, Hakeem are a smdige below for me. None of those is a 3 time MVP, only Curry won even twice. And their title winning teams were way better outside of them as the star player. in the playoffs Jokic and Murray played the most minutes, only Aaron Gordon, KCP and Porter Jr. played more than 30 minutes. compare that to the supporting casts of the others in the list in their title years. I think titles do and will matter, but not as much as they used to.</p>

<p>Just because we’ve had an entertaining run of different champions doesn’t mean it can’t happen again, and it feels like you’re moving the goal post now to make his case sound better.
Also, if he’s a top 10 player of all time I think he should make his mark and prove he’s better than everyone else by doing some more winning.</p>

<p>I do think it’s possible Wemby comes in and single handedly ruins the NBA in like 5 years though so maybe the Giannis/Jokic/Luka window is smaller than we think.</p>

<p>There’s only 1 championship a year which means Giannis and Jokic need to win <em>now</em> or else time is running out for them both to win another. And neither of their teams are projected to be the top of their conference next year, they’re both actually likely to finish 3rd or worse.</p>

<p>I think it’s a safe bet 1 of them wins 2+ and the other two win 0. That’s the most likely scenario.</p>

<p>2nd most likely is none of them win any.</p>

      <label for="ljkol4t" class="commentText"><p>Don’t agree. I think the most important criteria is titles and MVPs, obviously talent but anyone in this conversation already has the talent. Jokic already has enough MVPs. More than Shaq, Kobe and TD. The same amount as Bird and Magic. He just needs probably two more titles to seriously start thinking about who he knocks out of the top 10. Not saying he’ll get them but if he continues at the pace he’s going it looks like a possibility so no problem saying he could rank somewhere between 10-20 now.</p>

      <label for="ljl2bap" class="commentText"><p>Yeah 3 MVPs is great but I think we’re falling victim to being prisoner of the moment. He only has 1 ring, let’s wait until he has at least 3 before we even start to discuss this. Steph just started getting potential T10 conversations after ring #4 and he has changed the game of basketball, jokic has and will not have the same effect.</p>

      <label for="ljl7vu0" class="commentText"><p>People point to his 3 mvps but I only see 1 ring. Steph got his 4th and only then started to get T10 conversations. Sure he only has 2 mvps but one is unanimous which is very special. I think those 3 guys have a while to go of being at the top of the league and winning tittles. Jokic and Giannis are only 29. We need to chill with this obsession with who’s going to be T10.</p>

      <label for="ljma8ov" class="commentText"><p>I think that what drags Steph back, is that out of 4 rings he has only 1 fmvp.And he had other all stars including KD who was arguably better than him for 2 rings.If Jokic were to win 2 more rings and get fmvp on both I think that would put him over Larry Bird.Its not very likely that he will win considering the direction the nuggets are heading,but it&rsquo;s possible.</p>

      <label for="ljmglsv" class="commentText"><p>I disagree because within context we all know Steph was very deserving of FMVP every time he won, and arguably should’ve gotten it at least one of those (2015 or 2018 imo. 2017 was obviously KD) years. We make it seem like he didn’t win because he didn’t play well.</p>

<p>Jokic is 29 turning 30 I believe. At this point in Birds career he’s already won his 3 mvps and 3 rings. Not long after that is when his back changed his career trajectory. If jokic does match his accolades it’ll take him much longer to do so, so I’ll still give Bird the nod in that regard.</p>

      <label for="ljmjjws" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not saying Steph played bad in those years he didn&rsquo;t win the fmvp.He should have won 2015 fmvp.But he was the 2nd best player on 2 of those teams.Which just shows how much help he had in those years.
Jokic has 3 MVPs before 30 as well.Larry Bird had teammates that made the all star game 23 times through his career,and had much better teammates overall.Jokic never played with an all-star.Larry Bird was also not a fmvp for his 1st chip and has averaged 15 points on terrible efficiency in the finals.Larry Bird played until he was 35,he didn&rsquo;t stop playing basketball at 30,he just wasn&rsquo;t winning championships anymore.That shouldn&rsquo;t be a detriment to Jokic if he wins a chip at 32 instead of at 25.</p>

      <label for="ljlek7u" class="commentText"><p>I don’t really see it that way. Just being big wouldn’t suddenly make him a good defender and I reject the idea that the league was much worse offensively, the game was just different. Regardless these are all hypotheticals and he’s objectively bad on defense. I think he needs to do a little more to make up for being bad at literally half the game lol (which he does but not enough yet)</p>

<p>I also didn&rsquo;t like when people said that the league was worse offensively cause I&rsquo;m a mj defender, but when i go back and watch full games from the 90&rsquo;s the difference is so obvious.</p>

<p>I think Anthony Edwards right now is the most likely to join that list. If we are going off of just rookie year, I think Zion had a better rookie year but obviously he has had issues since. but big men can have longevity issues.</p>

      <label for="ljk9doa" class="commentText"><p>My hot take is that there isn&rsquo;t a single player currently in the league who will be unanimously considered top 10 by the time they retire (other than lebron). Steph was an icon for a decade, revolutionised the sport, won about as much as a player could in this era and had multiple mvps and yet is still a borderline case for top 10. Jokic is the next closest after steph and I don&rsquo;t see people putting him above shaq/hakeem unless he wins at least 2 more titles (which seems highly unlikely). Then we&rsquo;re just going purely off of potential, maybe luka wins 5 titles, averages a triple double every year and gets multiple mvps but it&rsquo;s also just as likely he never wins, regresses and is out of the league by the time he&rsquo;s 34. Wemby has promise but injuries will be a concern for his entire career.</p>

Already a 5 time all star, 3 straight all nba 1st team, 2 gold medals, 1 chip and ECF MVP. He would need to make another jump but if he wins a few chips as the best player on the team before 30, who knows.</p>

<p>For reference - Curry finished 6th in MVP voting in his age 25 season. Tatum finished 5th in his age 24 season.</p>

<p>All he realistically needs is another ring/FMVP to at least enter into that convo (Curry’s in that convo with 4 rings, 2 MVPs, 1 FMVP, so is Hakeem with 2/1/2, Bird with 3/3/2 etc.)</p>

      <label for="ljjx46i" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem is an outlier due to how hard his championships were. Curry&rsquo;s championships get discredited due to Durant and Jokic&rsquo;s first ring can get discredited due to the weaker teams they faced during their entire run.</p>

<p>Curry gets into the conversation because of his shooting. Not only is he significantly better than his contemporaries, but shooting is a talent that the casual fans understand and appreciate better than passing/bbiq.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same way that Lebron&rsquo;s passing/bbiq is almost treated like a footnote relative to his other accolades even though from a technical/mechanics perspective it&rsquo;s easily his greatest feat.</p>

<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t agree with any of this. The concept of aggregating individual skills/achievements with team skills/achievements&hellip; ACROSS ERAS&hellip; to create a quantifiable top 10 is ludicrous.</p>

<p>But the casual fanbase needs a way to participate as they cannot break down the game, and for them these sort of arguments will discredit Curry or Jokic for entering the top 10.</p>

Steph is incredible but you can&rsquo;t be one of the 10 best players of all time when you ain&rsquo;t even the best player on your own team 3 out of 4 rings (allegedly).</p>

<p>The top 10 is exclusively for 2-way players and I will die on this hill. If Curry put in as much energy as MJ or Kobe on defense and STILL put up 30+, I might be telling a different story.</p>

      <label for="ljjt16x" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s an injury prone dude who has one MVP at 30 years old and who has never gotten past the 2nd round of the playoffs.  It&rsquo;s possible he has Lebron-like longevity and keeps producing at this level for another like 8-10 more years, but given his injury history idk about that.</p>

<p>Luka / SGA are significantly younger, and are already playing at a very high level.  Luka has already gone further in the playoffs than Embiid ever has, and SGA has a very good team around him, so they more time and potential to build up the resumes to get them into the top 10.</p>
