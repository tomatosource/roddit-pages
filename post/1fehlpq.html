      <p>Some famous examples include Tmac, Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bynum, grant hill, bill Walton, yao ming. (honorable mention to Len bias, although not an injury). Who would have had the highest peak,by your estimation? Any suggestions and all recommendations welcome!</p>

      <label for="lmnda9a" class="commentText"><p>Walton had already won an FMVP at 24 and won an MVP at 25 the same year he got injured.  Seems fair to say that he could&rsquo;ve peaked even higher had he stayed healthy and he&rsquo;s already considered to have one of the highest peaks of all time.  I&rsquo;m not sure any other candidate is going to clear that.</p>

      <label for="lmovdiz" class="commentText"><p>I think this is the best answer for all of the reasons you stated.</p>

<p>The only other guy who has a case is Kawhi. Both Walton and Kawhi were at one point in time the best players in the league and could have accomplished a lot more without the injuries. You can‚Äôt say any of those other players were the absolute best in the league at any point in time.</p>

<p>I know Rose won an MVP, and he was probably top 3-5 in the league at his peak, but nobody would have said he was a better player than LeBron or Durant (and possibly not Wade or Kobe either). It would have been awesome to see his prime extended, but I also don‚Äôt how much better he would have gotten because his talent was so dependent on his ungodly speed and athleticism, which would have faded somewhat as he aged.</p>

<p>The other was Jokic who only had one MVP at the time (2021) and needed more to his resume to be considered</p>

I remember he immediately shut down any notion that Tim Duncan is actually a C disguised as a PF, because the thought of Timmy listed among all-time centers would eat him up inside, even though Timmy played C for the entire 4 years at Wake Forest, played a ton of minutes at C after Robinson&rsquo;s retirement, has a body type built like a C, and has all the skills and fundamentals, along with his positioning on the court, that&rsquo;d you see from an old school C.</p>

<p>Rose takes BPM and VORP but loses on PER &amp; WS. Fair argument that Rose had a better year but Dwight was by far the best defensive player in the league and had a much worse supporting cast than Rose.</p>

Narratives undoubtedly play a role, but it&rsquo;s hard to argue with a player who is top 10 in points per game and assists per game on the #1 seed with 62 wins, compared to the Magic at 52 wins.</p>

<p>The teammate thing is a tough sell, since neither had another All-Star on their team. If we&rsquo;re considering advanced metrics, by PER and BPM Orlando&rsquo;s Ryan Anderson was actually the next best player on either team, though Luol has a better VORP and WS.</p>

      <label for="lmnalob" class="commentText"><p>Oden was one of the best prospects ever. KD was an elite prospect, as well, but there was no doubt Oden was going #1. I&rsquo;m not sure how his career would have turned out with how 3-point oriented the game has become, but I think people would have been shocked if a healthy Oden had a career any worse than Embiid.</p>

<p>Many of the other guys you mentioned at least all got to have a peak even if it was shortened. Not saying he for sure would have been the best, but Oden, like Bias, is one of the biggest &lsquo;what-ifs&rsquo; in NBA history.</p>

      <label for="lmohnzp" class="commentText"><p>Oden was the number one overall pick because he was a center. It‚Äôs just conventional basketball knowledge if you have two prospects about equal in skill you just go with the bigger one.</p>

<p>KD is one of the best to ever play and that combined with the length of his career means I sincerely doubt Oden would have done better had he stayed healthy. The delta between them would probably still be similar to LeBron and Bosh or Dame and LMA. I bet Oden would‚Äôve been really good but better than KD? Probably not</p>

Yet there was also no doubt at all that he didn‚Äôt deserve to be taken #1. In fact, if you had a Time Machine and put all Lebron era players in it, while the first overall pick would obviously be Lebron, it‚Äôs distinctly possible that the 3rd overall pick would have been KD. That‚Äôs how good of a prospect he was.</p>

<p>But Oden was so much better of a prospect that it was obvious that he goes over Durant.</p>

      <label for="lmndrz5" class="commentText"><p>Drazen Petrovic would have likely been a strong contender for 1st team all NBA in 1994 if didn&rsquo;t die in 1993 following Jordans retirement.</p>

<ul>
<li>1992- 20ppg, .508 FG%, .444 3P%</li>
<li>1993- 22ppg, 518 FG%, .449 3P%</li>
</ul>

<p>Without Jordan in the league, Petrovic would have likely been the top scoring guard in the NBA in 94 (Sprewell had 21ppg in 94)He would have been given more and more opportunities to shoot  in the 94 and 95 seasons.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.grantland.com/features/arvydas-sabonis-long-strange-trip/" target="_blank">Please read this. it‚Äôs a great Grantland piece about Arvydas, with commentary by Walton.</a>. Literally anyone and everyone will get a trip out of this and some of the quotes shared. Here‚Äôs one by Bill Walton:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúHe could do everything. He had the skills of Larry Bird and Pete Maravich. He had the athleticism of Kareem, and he could shoot the 3-point shot. He could pass and run the floor, dribble. We should have carried out a plan in the early 1980s to kidnap him and bring him back right then.‚Äù</p>

      <label for="lmndok0" class="commentText"><p>You named all the big ones I think. But I gotta put Dwight Howard on the list. He injured his back in 2011-2012 (before we traded him, that&rsquo;s why he missed the playoff that season). He was never the same after that, despite still being damn good in Houston. He was <em>26</em> that season. Despite how dominant he was in the early part of his career, we almost certainly didn&rsquo;t actually see his prime. His peak could have been higher (mind you, this is a guy who won his <em>third</em> DPOY award the season prior at age 25, and still finished 3rd in 2012 despite only playing 54 games) if not just longer at the peak we saw.</p>

<p>He was an absolute iron man before that injury and it wasn&rsquo;t even a freak accident or anything, he got punched in the back by Brendon Haywood in a game against Dallas.</p>

<p>Personally. I think we saw the best of Rose and TMac, who may have maintained their peaks a bit more but still weren&rsquo;t quite the best in the league. I think Oden and Ming would&rsquo;ve peaked as very good, all-star level. I&rsquo;d argue that Penny and Hill had more historical career upside and might have ascended to the upper echelons of players.</p>

      <label for="lmnmaef" class="commentText"><p>Larry Bird with the stupid back injury in 1985 takes the prize here.  In 1985 he was arguably the best player in the world and he wasn&rsquo;t the same after that injury.</p>

<p>Ralph Sampson at 7 foot 4 had some guard skills for his time and had a pretty shooting stroke.  He could have been really special.</p>

<p>Tim Duncan could have been even better if he didn&rsquo;t blow out his meniscus in his right knee.</p>

<p>Ditto for Chris Webber&rsquo;s left knee.</p>

<p>Andrew Toney and misdiagnosed stress fractures on his feet.</p>

<p>Honorable mentions: Danny Manning, Bernard King, Brad Daugherty, Shaun Livingston</p>

      <label for="lmoqaj2" class="commentText"><p>Sabonis senior was a total beast. Lead the USSR national team winning Olympic gold, fiba World Cup champion, eurobasket champion. He could post up, he could pass, he could shoot 3s, he could block and steal, and rebound. He was Jokic before Jokic. If he came over earlier before injuries fucked him he would‚Äôve been an perennial all star and gave the Blazers the big man they needed to pair with Clyde Drexler and possibly beat the 92 Bulls with a line up of Terry Porter Clyde Drexler Jerome Kersey Clifford Robinson and Sabonis. But he was comfortable playing in the Spanish league and the for the USSR. They over used him and didn‚Äôt great good injuries correctly so by the time he came to the NBA he basically didn‚Äôt have knees and also he was under 21 and I guess there was a rule in the NBA at the time.</p>

<p>Arvydas Sabonis is the biggest what if for me. I feel like the Blazers have a ton of what ifs in general. Sabonis, Walton, Oden, Roy.</p>

But people don&rsquo;t realize how much of an athletic freak he was. His basketball skill and IQ were up there with the best (minus TO in ncaa) hahaha. But really this dude was unbelievable.  People thought he would be done,  but he was so smart and skilled he was still amazing, bit could have been spectacular.</p>

<p>Not often someone of Thompsons size rejects someone like Walton in that manner he was a special athlete and scored over 70 points before the 3 point line. Extremely underrated talent.</p>

      <label for="lmo6xau" class="commentText"><p>Assuming perfect health Duncan has a decent shot of winning 2 in a row losing two to the Lakers and then taking some number of the next 5, possibly all. Obviously that gets way less likely if other teams have perfect health too, for instance I don&rsquo;t think they beat the Lakers if Karl Malone is also in perfect health.</p>

<p>Durant is another interesting one. Breaks his foot right at the start of his prime after an absurd scoring season where he won MVP.</p>

      <label for="lmqhob9" class="commentText"><p>Yao Ming was playing the best basketball of his career when he broke his knee in his fifth season, he was in MVP talks, he had put it all together, he was averaging 26 and 10 and 2 blocks a game, when he came back for the playoffs he was averaging 25 and 10 vs the Jazz including dropping 29 in game 7 but they lost</p>

<p>Yao would never be fully healthy again, he kept playing on injuries instead of sitting out and fully healing, most likely from the pressure from his Chinese handlers and the Rockets themselves, guy had an infection in the bone of his foot and they rushed him back, they kept doing that and then wondered why he broke down</p>

<p>Yao was literally Jokic who defended the rim like Gobert but his injuries derailed his career, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt fault guys who don‚Äôt play hurt, you only get one body, Yao says he can‚Äôt even feel his foot anymore that‚Äôs how fucked up his injuries were</p>

The same can be said for a lot of guys, but MVP Rose was a whole vibe, imo. Penny Hardaway is another one. He was before his time. People forget a young Penny and Shaq eliminated Jordan in the playoffs. Granted, they got smoked down the road, but he was still putting it all together before injuries derailed his career.</p>
