      <p>Some famous examples include Tmac, Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bynum, grant hill, bill Walton, yao ming. (honorable mention to Len bias, although not an injury). Who would have had the highest peak,by your estimation? Any suggestions and all recommendations welcome!</p>

I don’t get why people think he was gonna develop into Michael Jordan but better. He likely remains stagnant or becomes a slightly better shooter as his athleticism declines to stay at the top for longer. And that would still be an all-time great player regardless</p>

<p>It’s disrespectful to compare a career like Penny’s, which was clearly already successful but cut short by injury, to a guy like Len Bias who never got on the floor, or one like Greg Oden who fell apart immediately.</p>

      <label for="lmnalob" class="commentText"><p>Oden was one of the best prospects ever. KD was an elite prospect, as well, but there was no doubt Oden was going #1. I&rsquo;m not sure how his career would have turned out with how 3-point oriented the game has become, but I think people would have been shocked if a healthy Oden had a career any worse than Embiid.</p>

<p>Many of the other guys you mentioned at least all got to have a peak even if it was shortened. Not saying he for sure would have been the best, but Oden, like Bias, is one of the biggest &lsquo;what-ifs&rsquo; in NBA history.</p>

</ul>

<p>Without Jordan in the league, Petrovic would have likely been the top scoring guard in the NBA in 94 (Sprewell had 21ppg in 94)He would have been given more and more opportunities to shoot  in the 94 and 95 seasons.</p>

      <label for="lmndstz" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m just old enough to remember how much hype was around him during his rookie season. He looked like an absolute monster. The &ldquo;next MJ&rdquo; stuff was a little silly but the dude had potential to be talked about as one of the greatest guards to play the game.</p>

<p>His ability to revive his career as a highly valuable role player with elite defense is another testament to just how good he was at the game of basketball.</p>

      <label for="lmndok0" class="commentText"><p>You named all the big ones I think. But I gotta put Dwight Howard on the list. He injured his back in 2011-2012 (before we traded him, that&rsquo;s why he missed the playoff that season). He was never the same after that, despite still being damn good in Houston. He was <em>26</em> that season. Despite how dominant he was in the early part of his career, we almost certainly didn&rsquo;t actually see his prime. His peak could have been higher (mind you, this is a guy who won his <em>third</em> DPOY award the season prior at age 25, and still finished 3rd in 2012 despite only playing 54 games) if not just longer at the peak we saw.</p>

<p>He was an absolute iron man before that injury and it wasn&rsquo;t even a freak accident or anything, he got punched in the back by Brendon Haywood in a game against Dallas.</p>

<p>Bynum was kind of a disappointment generally, even when healthy.</p>

<p>Rose is interesting, because (imo) he was pretty overrated when he played, certainly including his MVP, and he’s kind of kept that legacy… but he also had ridiculous physical tools and was still young when his body gave out. He could have lived up to his early hype with better health.</p>

<p>Oden is the biggest what if in NBA history, and he certainly belongs. I would also suggest Penny Hardaway… he was just emerging into superstardom when he went down.</p>

<p>Personally. I think we saw the best of Rose and TMac, who may have maintained their peaks a bit more but still weren&rsquo;t quite the best in the league. I think Oden and Ming would&rsquo;ve peaked as very good, all-star level. I&rsquo;d argue that Penny and Hill had more historical career upside and might have ascended to the upper echelons of players.</p>

Tmac I believe was 29 when he got surgery. Oden was bigger than Dwight, just as good as defense, with a better offensive package. He was highly skilled out of college. Hard to say where he goes but his trajectory was maybe higher than yaos. Walton was so huge and skilled though, plus the thought that it was preventable injury just makes it that much more a vote I like going with lol</p>

      <label for="lmngeaz" class="commentText"><p>Bynum was arguably a better center than prime Dwight in his incredibly short peak. And he was so young when his knee problems started, if he never had those problems he could have been all-nba level for years, at least until the major shift to the 3pt era. Remember he was benched for even shooting a 3. These days if a center shoots an open three and is benched for it people would be scratching their heads (although it was not his game, and seemed like a he did it more as a sign of disrespect to the coaches. Still though, out of context it&rsquo;s a little wild when we consider where the game has gone). Bynum for Dwight trade packages were all over sports news debates</p>

      <label for="lmna5hc" class="commentText"><p>Rose. Too be that young and dominant knowing he was only going to get better. The same can be said for a lot of guys, but MVP Rose was a whole vibe, imo. Penny Hardaway is another one. He was before his time. People forget a young Penny and Shaq eliminated Jordan in the playoffs. Granted, they got smoked down the road, but he was still putting it all together before injuries derailed his career.</p>

      <label for="lmnd6yl" class="commentText"><p>So…prevented a higher peak, as in were really talking more about guys like Walton/TMac than Oden or Bias who never really even got going?</p>

<p>It’s probably Walton, he was phenomenal already anyway and may have unseated Bill Russell as all time defender if he’d stayed at peak health</p>
