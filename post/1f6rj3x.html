      <p>90-100 points is plenty of action and every bucket still feels meaningful.  Sub 90s can get a little ugly (ex 2004 pistons) so I definitely see why they decided to open the game up. Unfortunately, we’ve swung way too far in the other direction. 120ppg just makes every basket feel less meaningful and there are hardly any stops in a regular season game. Think about it, one of the elements of the 2016 game 7 that made it so memorable was that long stretch without any scoring in the fourth and how each shot felt like it had the weight of the universe on it. I think moving the 3pt line back and letting defenders be a bit more physical would ultimately move the league in the right direction.</p>

      <label for="ll2xidq" class="commentText"><p>And I personally want physical offensive post play allowed more. If a team manages to get a big on a small near the rim, they should exploit it. But there&rsquo;s too many instances of Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart types being allowed to mug offensive post players and then flop like crazy to draw offensive fouls. It discourages post play even more than just basic analytics.</p>

<p>So most teams just ignore it and move onto other offensive actions. I think defenders should be allowed to be physical, but offensive post players should be allowed to punish mismatches.</p>

<p>Perimeter players don&rsquo;t face that same risk for offensive fouls with all pushing off that is allowed. In fact are granted ticky tack fouls from defenders often. Post defenders seem to be allowed to be much more physical and offensive players can&rsquo;t match it without an offensive foul.</p>

      <label for="ll325d0" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s definitely a huge factor now. Defenses are so good at helping, doubling, rotating, recovering, etc. I think most people would say they want more post play and balance from offenses but the application of the rules doesn&rsquo;t encourage it enough so teams/players have gone away from it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know of a full on solution, because I wouldn&rsquo;t want the league to revert to illegal defense rules from the 90s either.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s way easier for Embiid of someone to pump fake a jump into a defender to get 2 FTs instead of all the energy and skill required to post someone up.</p>

      <label for="ll35k1v" class="commentText"><p>This is definitely the take of a Bucks fan lol</p>

<p>Being bigger and taller is already a huge advantage without getting to push people off their spot. If the defender is planting their feet to take a charge, that&rsquo;s committal. For a smaller player to contest a shot, they have to jump before the offensive player, which is also committal. If a player can&rsquo;t figure out how to use an extra foot and 100 lbs, that&rsquo;s 100% a them problem. Like they can literally just react. I think it&rsquo;s cooler for offensive players to have to use their genetic tools to actually play basketball instead of them being allowed to just run people over because they&rsquo;re bigger lol.</p>

<p>If someone like Giannis doesn&rsquo;t score against Smart or Lowry in the post, it&rsquo;s because HE fucked up and straight up picked literally the only losing option out of the million afforded to him by his size. As it is, Giannis already gets the best no calls in the league. 90% of the dude&rsquo;s game right now is just running people over and betting on the refs not calling 5 fouls.</p>

      <label for="ll3a15q" class="commentText"><p>Yea understand the Bucks thing, but i wasn&rsquo;t trying to reference Giannis at all and was specifically referring to back to the basket post play. I was thinking more of how Embiid should play if he cut the BS or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/8WandkWIFc" target="_blank">Plays like this. </a>.</p>

<p>Gobert did nothing wrong there. That was a textbook finish to punish a smaller player. Didn&rsquo;t elbow, lower the shoulder, push off. Just turned in his own space, Booker goes flying and boom offensive foul. That stuff happens all the time and it stops teams from even trying.</p>

<p>Embiid could be punishing people like prime Shaq, but the rules and officiating encourage him to play the way he does. It would be harder and less efficient for him to play more physically. So until something changes, he will keep playing that way and so will most of the league.</p>

<p>Lowry would absolutely draw offensive fouls on prime Shaq by being quick, throwing his body into Shaq, and then flying backwards. When I think they should allow them to go body to body as physically as possible in a back down situation and let it play out. Of course if there&rsquo;s elbows, blatant shoving, tripping, hitting arms during a shot call a foul. But other than that, let both players be equally physical.</p>

<p>The way it&rsquo;s officiated now, defense is allowed to throw their whole bodies into the offensive player and when the offensive player tries to return 25% of that, they are most likely being hit with an offensive foul.</p>

<p>What I want in the end is more balance and more encouragement for post ups. Few more Al Jeffersons and Zach Randolphs around the league would be great for entertainment purposes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No it&rsquo;s 100% an offensive foul and the other guy is right, the onus is on the post player to be skilled and understand hot to punish the mismatch without bulldozing thru the defender. Gobert is standing straight up and uses his shoulder/elbow to dislodge Booker thru the pivot; he needed to get lower and use his hips to move Booker if that was the method he so chose to score.</p>

<p>And again, there&rsquo;s the concept that OP mentioned that often times the offense has multiple options to score with skill but these dudes just choose the only wrong option half the time because they get to giddy when they see a size advantage. You&rsquo;re not entitled to play the game with brute force, sometimes the right play is to just use your footwork and try to go around the guy or shot right over (Gobert has horrible touch so he refused to shoot the layup right over Booker and decided he <em>needs</em> to dunk it).</p>

<p>Refs call offensive fouls on these plays because the post player is trying to go thru the defender; its just like on the perimeter, you&rsquo;re not allowed to just drive into a defender&rsquo;s sternum out of control, charge.</p>

      <label for="ll3lv2y" class="commentText"><p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying, but I disagree that that was contact that warrants an offensive foul. There&rsquo;s plenty of examples of what you&rsquo;re describing, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it at all. Booker was throwing his body into Gobert and he turned to score. He didn&rsquo;t bash into him, throw an elbow, extend a forearm or anything like that. I&rsquo;m not even saying a foul on Booker would be appropriate. I would want a no call and repeated no calls so that defenders are encouraged to stand their ground. But It&rsquo;s not really worth going back and forth if we disagree.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re correct that you aren&rsquo;t entitled to play with brute force. But this is absolute a contact sport and varying degrees and types of physical play are allowed. It&rsquo;s a part of what makes it fun.</p>

<p>I think the officiating overcorrected years ago and started calling every possible foul on the perimeter no matter what and that they also overcompensated from Shaq&rsquo;s era on allowing contact down low. Neither is improving the entertainment in my opinion.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of low post skill around the league and I think it&rsquo;s partly discouraged by the officiating and partly other factors like analytics, coaching, and improved defenses.</p>

<p>Same thing with perimeter defense. For about 5 years it was nearly impossible to defend someone like Harden because of the way the game was being officiated in combination with his skill and ability to exploit the officiating. Not because perimeter defenders all sucked around the league. It&rsquo;s hard to defend on the perimeter and the officiating makes it harder.</p>

<p>To some degree, I still think officiating is making it harder for offensive post players. And if we want more post play in the future , I&rsquo;d be really interested to hear more ideas if you had any. For example I wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to making the lane more narrow.</p>

      <label for="ll3nkjn" class="commentText"><p>If you pause the Gobert clip around the 3sec mark after he turns, you can see the white of the court because of the angle of his arm outside of his body. This means that he effectively used his elbow to dislodge the defender, thats why that one was called. It&rsquo;s not necessarily about the magnitude of the force that refs are judging, it&rsquo;s about legal vs illegal body positions.</p>

<p>Every time I see a blatant mismatch in a game, I always get ready for a charge because some of these dudes are so predictable lol I&rsquo;d do the same thing if I was a defender. You ask how to reintroduce post play and to me the only answer is proper skill development, these guys just aren&rsquo;t taught well enough how to avoid these charges and still score.</p>

<p>Back in Kareem&rsquo;s time, I think they refereed this even more strictly which is partially why he had to develop the skyhook, because he wasnt allowed to just back down thru defenders. It&rsquo;s part of why you see old school bigs looking stiff down there, they were trying not to pick up charges and they also weren&rsquo;t allowed as much leeway with carrying on the backdown dribbles.</p>

<p>There’s nothing worse than watching a player (big or small) jumping into an opponent and flailing around with no chance to realistically make the basket just to get bailed out by the refs.</p>

<p>All foul baiting should be a non-call. If a player snaps their head back or flops, it should be an automatic non-call.</p>

      <label for="ll33v42" class="commentText"><p>Everyone brings up &ldquo;fouls are down&rdquo; to prove the refs aren&rsquo;t calling softer fouls, but the argument doesn&rsquo;t hold water.</p>

<p>This is easiest to see if we examine any particular call. Let&rsquo;s look at the plain old &ldquo;hacking a guy who&rsquo;s shooting across the arm,&rdquo; as an example.</p>

<p>Any defender is trying to get away with the most they can. There&rsquo;s a constant, perhaps largely unconscious cost benefit analysis. &ldquo;The odds of getting the stop vs the odds of getting called for a foul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If hacks are being called more tightly and reliably, you back off on contact. If they&rsquo;re being called more loosely, you make more contact. You can easily end up with the same number of fouls playing dramatically differently in different reffing environments.</p>

<p>However the refs are calling, teams adjust, seeking what they think is the optimal balance of fouls called vs defensive aggression. The modern, multi-year decline is probably largely to do with analytics, as defenses prioritize not fouling.</p>

<p>Same basic thing with push-offs, charges, travels, etc.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say the refs don&rsquo;t affect the gross number of fouls at all. Obviously they do over the course of a single game, and we saw last year that if they make a big change to reffing mid-season, that affects total fouls called. But it&rsquo;s the smaller piece.</p>

<p>If you want to know how refs are calling things then vs now, there&rsquo;s no reason I can see to think that fouls called per 100 can even give you a decent guess. You need to actually break down film to have an answer worth anything.</p>

      <label for="ll2u0bp" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. It was incredible to watch. Refereeing may have played some part of it, but I think it was mostly attributed to effort and coaching. Especially with the Mavs (although they had started picking up their defensive play the last month or 2 of the season). Which I don’t think is sustainable in today’s NBA with reliance on “Big 3”s and load management.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m torn on the carry rule. On one hand it&rsquo;s truly egregious at times but on the other, the ball handling of today is so much more aesthetically pleasing than it was pre-00&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="ll4fjpa" class="commentText"><p>Its the complete disruption of the dribble&rsquo;s rhythm that makes it so ugly. 25 years ago it was controversial to even slow the ball down in the pocket with your hand on the side of the ball, but imo that was generally a positive development as the ball still didn&rsquo;t truly stop for any noticeable time and allowed for a blossoming of attacking moves. Now we&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where players can basically stop the ball for a good half second in their hand then move the dribble whatever direction they want.  It just looks cheap and is clearly not a consistent natural dribbling of the basketball.  It also allows players without the necessary ball handling skill to operate in ways against defenders they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to. The league should not be allowing the skill pool to be watered down through rules in an increasingly competitive and exposed league, they should be extracting the very best basketball has to offer.</p>

      <label for="ll4gxwn" class="commentText"><p>The illegal screening is so bad, and I think the hardest part about it is for casual fans its barely noticeable so the league has little incentive to change but the effects are massive.  Things like allowing even small hip checks or shoulder dip as a defender chases over the screen never get called but completely change the outcome for the defense and make the situation significantly easier for the ball handler.  Same with off ball when the screener can catch the defender and take a solid half step back with them while still making contact gives the offensive player so much extra time to get space away.</p>

      <label for="ll31uci" class="commentText"><p>Also “hand is part of the ball” seems very inconsistent in how it’s called. If someone is shooting, and the block attempt slaps hand after the ball is released, it doesn’t effect the shot, and is no danger to the shooter (like stepping under him). Shouldn’t be a foul imo.</p>

      <label for="ll3b0ci" class="commentText"><p>I would settle for: &ldquo;make an unambiguous ruleset that can be applied consistently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right now I feel like they have vague rules that <em>have to</em> be applied inconsistently in order for the game to be watchable.  You could call a foul on every play if you wanted to.  You could also call almost no fouls.  Traveling is also all over the place, they&rsquo;re wildly inconsistent about certain things like whether you can pivot after a hopstep or what degree of carrying actually constitutes carrying or whether you get five gather steps or seventeen</p>

      <label for="ll2fdvb" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think the point differential you point out is an issue with the quality of the game. I do think they need to allow defenders to defend and they are taking that away. I do not want to see the 3 pt line moved back.  There is no way to move the corner 3 back  without eliminating it. The style of play will change. It was always obvious that you could score more points making 3s at a lower percentage than 2s, but for years, coaches didn&rsquo;t let their players shoot 3s in volume until some teams started providing a proof of concept which other teams adopted and expanded.</p>

I actually agree that the pace is a little crazy now but your post is just like a regurgitation of the most popular and lazy takes. You’re allowed to talk basketball but by posting on an open forum, be ready to actually defend yourself especially if the post you wrote isn’t good.</p>

      <label for="ll2fshy" class="commentText"><p>This honestly feels kind of pedantic. The league and everybody else tracks average points per game per team. It doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to discern that suggesting a target scoring range means rule changes. The question being posed afterwards is exactly &ldquo;How could it get there?&rdquo;. Fine if you don&rsquo;t agree that moving the three point line back solves that, but why play stupid as if you don&rsquo;t understand the logic of the question./</p>

<p>if you consume any amount of nba content on social media or even on reddit, you&rsquo;d notice most of the stuff is some form of a stephen a smith, nba on tnt, skip bayless, or random blog boy hot take regurgitation.</p>

<p>moving the 3pt line back?</p>

<ul>
<li>more spacing and more scoring probably. guys can already shoot from multiple ft behind the line</li>
</ul>

<p>more physical defense?</p>

<ul>
<li>this can go either way, but with FTA per game per 100 possessions as low as they&rsquo;ve ever been, i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a huge issue</li>
</ul>

<p>guys are just too good at scoring now in the nba, and it&rsquo;s been incredible to watch. i think if the nba was covered differently, we wouldn&rsquo;t have so many posts and people complaining that there&rsquo;s something wrong with the league that needs to be changed. we see it at least once a week on this sub.</p>

<p>i think defenders and offensive players get away with a lot already - the best players just know how to take advantage of these things. too many guys play defense with their hands, ball-watch, grab and shove off-ball</p>

<p>i just don&rsquo;t know how you arrived at the 100 ppg number - seems completely arbitrary</p>

The reddit threads I find to have dumb takes I simply just do not participate in, I am confused where you are lost brother. I do use reddit to voice my opinions but that does not necessarily mean that my opinions are influenced by reddit or any social media outlet.</p>

<p>And the 100ppg is roughly the leage average from the 90s to mid 2010&rsquo;s which I found to be a good balance of offense and defense IMO (excluding the early 2000&rsquo;s).</p>

<p>a large percentage of the coverage is some form of &ldquo;they couldn&rsquo;t have done this back in the day because it was much tougher.&rdquo; kg just had a comment the other day saying there&rsquo;s not a single guy in the league now who could play in the league 20 years ago because of physicality. that&rsquo;s what i mean.</p>

      <label for="ll2irxp" class="commentText"><p>I think 105 or so is the mark. Kind of the historic average. Bad offenses hit 99, great ones go 110.</p>

<p>Rather than moving the line or reintroducing hand checking (which sucks) , I&rsquo;d say shrink the paint and let defenders bump when both going to a spot. That ridiculous drive, bump, flail is insane, let the contact happen.</p>

<p>The craziest idea, which would change the aesthetic/strategy to better incentivize middies/post play would be changing the points. Make 2s worth 3 and 3s worth 4. This would ruin scores/points/averages and historic comps. But right now, a 33% 3fg is comparable to a 50% 2fg. Changing the values makes it 38% 3fg to equal 50% 2fg. Worth it if you&rsquo;re elite, but nowhere near what it is.</p>

<p>I think moving the 3pt line back and letting defenders be a bit more physical would ultimately move the league in the right direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to move the 3 point line back without eliminating corner 3s—and that would completely change the game TBH</p>

<p>I would argue the NBA ramps up physicality allowed in the playoffs anyway</p>

<p>The reason scores have skyrocketed has less to do with rules/the NBA and more to do with increased shooting skill in the league and coaches adopting the &ldquo;pace and space&rdquo; era—more teams pushing the pace, and teams having multiple shooters that spread the floor and unclog the paint.</p>

<p>All that said, I very much remember when scores were in the 90s-low 100s in the 90s through the 00s.</p>

<p>The game is so much better now. It’s much more exciting, there’s a lot more playmaking, there’s more focus on novel offensive and defensive strategies. The players are smarter and have greater all around skills. The game is just straight up better now. Anyone who thinks they want to go back, just wasn’t watching basketball then.</p>

I think they started doing that after the allstar break last year, and it was a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Except they didn&rsquo;t, the reason the rules changed to stop letting talentless bums beat up on guys who could score was David Stern was smart enough to notice fans loved the Suns style of offense and how the ratings for their games were high, especially after the Spurs v Pistons Finals no one watched, he knew what fans wanted and gave it to them</p>

<p>Without Stern taking the league in this direction you would not have Steph Curry and all these guys electrifying the league with their scoring, you say the league was better back then but the ratings disagree with you</p>

      <label for="ll38mh0" class="commentText"><p>They just need to allow everyone to be more physical within reason. Hand checks and bumping hard in the post and when backing people down should all be on the table. Let foul baiters look like idiots and get zero calls. Also actually enforce dribbling rules. Basically just need to get back to people being able to play physical without it being a 95% chance of a foul on the defender regardless of who initiated and promote skill when handling the ball since there are <em>way</em> too many carries and extremely questionable continuations of player&rsquo;s dribble</p>

<p>Honestly I think the whole shit where players try to jump into defenders to draw fouls should be a tech on the offensive player. Flop rules should also actually be enforced by a third party when they can prove it either during the next deadball or post game. Need to stop rewarding people for trying to cheat. Tricking the refs is cheating. Get people back to playing basketball not playing the refs</p>

      <label for="ll3o2ru" class="commentText"><p>I, for one, like the more mobile, open play of Curry era rather than the back-to-the-goal, pound-your-way-to 2 points style of Shaq era basketball. And I think a lot more of the world agrees with my taste. Basketball and NBA in particular, have never been more popular across the world.</p>

<p>NBA  can still do some of the things you mentioned while still favoring  skill over sheer body mass based game. Call carries and travels properly (that is, according to the rules).  Stop calling fouls on defenders in the paint for merely breathing in the direction of the offensive player. Reduce the number of timeouts at the end of the game. Etc. Use post game reviews to call out flopping players and attach some meaningful  penalty to that (not money). Maybe playoff tie breakers or draft probabilities etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot more that can be done without calling for &ldquo;more physical play&rdquo;. Nobody wants wrestling matches on the court.</p>

      <label for="ll43qqq" class="commentText"><p>Scoring goes down in the playoffs just look at the finals. When teams lock in for 48 minutes there is still plenty of defense to be played.</p>

<p>Moving the 3pt line back is not nearly as easy as you think. Unless you are ok with the 3pt line ending near the edges (which imo would be a horrible change). The only way you can do it otherwise is to widen the court, which will give offenses even more space.</p>

      <label for="ll4fkce" class="commentText"><p>Everyone wants the game to be &ldquo;more physical&rdquo; and wants to see fewer fouls called until the team they&rsquo;re a fan of loses, then it&rsquo;ll turn into them complaining about &ldquo;blatant no-calls&rdquo; and free throw disparity.</p>

<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t think people understand what hand-checking actually is when they think it&rsquo;ll make some huge difference as to how much teams score. It&rsquo;s not like guys just didn&rsquo;t score on isos in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. There was definitely more physical play allowed (particularly in the paint and in scuffles) but it wasn&rsquo;t like they were playing jail ball in the 90s, especially early 90s.</p>

<p>The biggest reason for the scoring explosion is the emphasis on spacing (along with 3 point shooting) and skillset. When you have 4-5 guys on the floor at all times who can shoot a 3 as well as pass, dribble, and shoot, the odds of getting 3 points instead of 2 is drastically higher than it was 30 years ago. Also, more space (not just horizontally, but vertically, since shooting 28-foot shots is normal now) opens up so many driving and passing opportunities that didn&rsquo;t exist before. A minor change in rules won&rsquo;t change how teams play dramatically. It&rsquo;ll never go back to scores of 95-90 on the regular because the game has just moved past that point.</p>

<p>In the actual NBA rulebook, many rules are unchanged from what they&rsquo;ve been for decades. The difference is in how they&rsquo;re enforced. The NFL has actually had a ton of rule changes to actively strip away defense and emphasize offense (although defenses are catching up now finally).</p>

No defense invited foul baiting, so they have to find the middle ground as to not discourage players from playing defense, while not rewarding popular players with ticky tack bait fouls.  Drawing a foul is an art, usually coming from being a better offensive player on the court.</p>
