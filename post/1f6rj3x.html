    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>90-100 points is plenty of action and every bucket still feels meaningful.  Sub 90s can get a little ugly (ex 2004 pistons) so I definitely see why they decided to open the game up. Unfortunately, we’ve swung way too far in the other direction. 120ppg just makes every basket feel less meaningful and there are hardly any stops in a regular season game. Think about it, one of the elements of the 2016 game 7 that made it so memorable was that long stretch without any scoring in the fourth and how each shot felt like it had the weight of the universe on it. I think moving the 3pt line back and letting defenders be a bit more physical would ultimately move the league in the right direction.</p>

      <label for="ll2xidq" class="commentText"><p>And I personally want physical offensive post play allowed more. If a team manages to get a big on a small near the rim, they should exploit it. But there&rsquo;s too many instances of Kyle Lowry and Marcus Smart types being allowed to mug offensive post players and then flop like crazy to draw offensive fouls. It discourages post play even more than just basic analytics.</p>

<p>So most teams just ignore it and move onto other offensive actions. I think defenders should be allowed to be physical, but offensive post players should be allowed to punish mismatches.</p>

<p>Perimeter players don&rsquo;t face that same risk for offensive fouls with all pushing off that is allowed. In fact are granted ticky tack fouls from defenders often. Post defenders seem to be allowed to be much more physical and offensive players can&rsquo;t match it without an offensive foul.</p>

      <label for="ll325d0" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s definitely a huge factor now. Defenses are so good at helping, doubling, rotating, recovering, etc. I think most people would say they want more post play and balance from offenses but the application of the rules doesn&rsquo;t encourage it enough so teams/players have gone away from it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know of a full on solution, because I wouldn&rsquo;t want the league to revert to illegal defense rules from the 90s either.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s way easier for Embiid of someone to pump fake a jump into a defender to get 2 FTs instead of all the energy and skill required to post someone up.</p>

<p>If the easier path is there for you, you absolutely should take it.</p>

      <label for="ll35k1v" class="commentText"><p>This is definitely the take of a Bucks fan lol</p>

<p>Being bigger and taller is already a huge advantage without getting to push people off their spot. If the defender is planting their feet to take a charge, that&rsquo;s committal. For a smaller player to contest a shot, they have to jump before the offensive player, which is also committal. If a player can&rsquo;t figure out how to use an extra foot and 100 lbs, that&rsquo;s 100% a them problem. Like they can literally just react. I think it&rsquo;s cooler for offensive players to have to use their genetic tools to actually play basketball instead of them being allowed to just run people over because they&rsquo;re bigger lol.</p>

<p>If someone like Giannis doesn&rsquo;t score against Smart or Lowry in the post, it&rsquo;s because HE fucked up and straight up picked literally the only losing option out of the million afforded to him by his size. As it is, Giannis already gets the best no calls in the league. 90% of the dude&rsquo;s game right now is just running people over and betting on the refs not calling 5 fouls.</p>

      <label for="ll3a15q" class="commentText"><p>Yea understand the Bucks thing, but i wasn&rsquo;t trying to reference Giannis at all and was specifically referring to back to the basket post play. I was thinking more of how Embiid should play if he cut the BS or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/8WandkWIFc" target="_blank">Plays like this. </a>.</p>

<p>Gobert did nothing wrong there. That was a textbook finish to punish a smaller player. Didn&rsquo;t elbow, lower the shoulder, push off. Just turned in his own space, Booker goes flying and boom offensive foul. That stuff happens all the time and it stops teams from even trying.</p>

<p>Embiid could be punishing people like prime Shaq, but the rules and officiating encourage him to play the way he does. It would be harder and less efficient for him to play more physically. So until something changes, he will keep playing that way and so will most of the league.</p>

<p>Lowry would absolutely draw offensive fouls on prime Shaq by being quick, throwing his body into Shaq, and then flying backwards. When I think they should allow them to go body to body as physically as possible in a back down situation and let it play out. Of course if there&rsquo;s elbows, blatant shoving, tripping, hitting arms during a shot call a foul. But other than that, let both players be equally physical.</p>

<p>The way it&rsquo;s officiated now, defense is allowed to throw their whole bodies into the offensive player and when the offensive player tries to return 25% of that, they are most likely being hit with an offensive foul.</p>

<p>What I want in the end is more balance and more encouragement for post ups. Few more Al Jeffersons and Zach Randolphs around the league would be great for entertainment purposes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No it&rsquo;s 100% an offensive foul and the other guy is right, the onus is on the post player to be skilled and understand hot to punish the mismatch without bulldozing thru the defender. Gobert is standing straight up and uses his shoulder/elbow to dislodge Booker thru the pivot; he needed to get lower and use his hips to move Booker if that was the method he so chose to score.</p>

<p>And again, there&rsquo;s the concept that OP mentioned that often times the offense has multiple options to score with skill but these dudes just choose the only wrong option half the time because they get to giddy when they see a size advantage. You&rsquo;re not entitled to play the game with brute force, sometimes the right play is to just use your footwork and try to go around the guy or shot right over (Gobert has horrible touch so he refused to shoot the layup right over Booker and decided he <em>needs</em> to dunk it).</p>

<p>Refs call offensive fouls on these plays because the post player is trying to go thru the defender; its just like on the perimeter, you&rsquo;re not allowed to just drive into a defender&rsquo;s sternum out of control, charge.</p>

<p>There’s nothing worse than watching a player (big or small) jumping into an opponent and flailing around with no chance to realistically make the basket just to get bailed out by the refs.</p>

      <label for="ll33v42" class="commentText"><p>Everyone brings up &ldquo;fouls are down&rdquo; to prove the refs aren&rsquo;t calling softer fouls, but the argument doesn&rsquo;t hold water.</p>

<p>This is easiest to see if we examine any particular call. Let&rsquo;s look at the plain old &ldquo;hacking a guy who&rsquo;s shooting across the arm,&rdquo; as an example.</p>

<p>Any defender is trying to get away with the most they can. There&rsquo;s a constant, perhaps largely unconscious cost benefit analysis. &ldquo;The odds of getting the stop vs the odds of getting called for a foul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If hacks are being called more tightly and reliably, you back off on contact. If they&rsquo;re being called more loosely, you make more contact. You can easily end up with the same number of fouls playing dramatically differently in different reffing environments.</p>

<p>However the refs are calling, teams adjust, seeking what they think is the optimal balance of fouls called vs defensive aggression. The modern, multi-year decline is probably largely to do with analytics, as defenses prioritize not fouling.</p>

<p>Same basic thing with push-offs, charges, travels, etc.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say the refs don&rsquo;t affect the gross number of fouls at all. Obviously they do over the course of a single game, and we saw last year that if they make a big change to reffing mid-season, that affects total fouls called. But it&rsquo;s the smaller piece.</p>

<p>If you want to know how refs are calling things then vs now, there&rsquo;s no reason I can see to think that fouls called per 100 can even give you a decent guess. You need to actually break down film to have an answer worth anything.</p>

      <label for="ll4fjpa" class="commentText"><p>Its the complete disruption of the dribble&rsquo;s rhythm that makes it so ugly. 25 years ago it was controversial to even slow the ball down in the pocket with your hand on the side of the ball, but imo that was generally a positive development as the ball still didn&rsquo;t truly stop for any noticeable time and allowed for a blossoming of attacking moves. Now we&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where players can basically stop the ball for a good half second in their hand then move the dribble whatever direction they want.  It just looks cheap and is clearly not a consistent natural dribbling of the basketball.  It also allows players without the necessary ball handling skill to operate in ways against defenders they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to. The league should not be allowing the skill pool to be watered down through rules in an increasingly competitive and exposed league, they should be extracting the very best basketball has to offer.</p>

<p>But trying to define a rule for that much less enforce it at game speed would be difficult.</p>

      <label for="ll4gxwn" class="commentText"><p>The illegal screening is so bad, and I think the hardest part about it is for casual fans its barely noticeable so the league has little incentive to change but the effects are massive.  Things like allowing even small hip checks or shoulder dip as a defender chases over the screen never get called but completely change the outcome for the defense and make the situation significantly easier for the ball handler.  Same with off ball when the screener can catch the defender and take a solid half step back with them while still making contact gives the offensive player so much extra time to get space away.</p>

If someone is shooting, and the block attempt slaps hand after the ball is released, it doesn’t effect the shot, and is no danger to the shooter (like stepping under him). Shouldn’t be a foul imo.</p>

<p>Right now I feel like they have vague rules that <em>have to</em> be applied inconsistently in order for the game to be watchable.  You could call a foul on every play if you wanted to.  You could also call almost no fouls.  Traveling is also all over the place, they&rsquo;re wildly inconsistent about certain things like whether you can pivot after a hopstep or what degree of carrying actually constitutes carrying or whether you get five gather steps or seventeen</p>

      <label for="ll5gebk" class="commentText"><p>This is really the crux of the issue any time these threads pop up.  There&rsquo;s a reason there are so many comebacks from 20 points down, and it&rsquo;s not because of &ldquo;3P variance&rdquo; or whatever other narratives people come up with.  It&rsquo;s because when your team gets down 20, every time they drive it&rsquo;s a block, not a charge; the team down 20 gets to play physical with no whistles on defense, the team up 20 gets ticky tacky calls until the score levels, etc.  Coaches even coach their players to drive to the basket more when their team gets down because it&rsquo;s consciously or subconsciously known they are more likely to get soft whistles.</p>

<p>And now with sports betting so ingrained into the games, this is even more of a certainty.  The league will absolutely get pressure from gambling industry if the standard deviation of outcomes gets wildly away from the lines set.  I do not believe the games are &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; as in the outcomes are predetermined, but I absolutely do believe the refs are rubber banding outcomes to be closer to get towards the lines set and to ultimately keep viewers tuned in through the end of the game.  You know those blue shells are coming when your team gets down big.</p>

<p>There are a few glaring examples that could be easily addressed on the foul baiting. In simplest terms, if the offensive player is the one initiating the contact, it should be at worst a no call unless the defender makes unnecessary follow-up/follow-through contact. Intentionally shooting a jump shot under a defenders legally positioned arm should not reward free throws. Jumping directly into an airborne defender to chuck a shot that has next to zero chance to go in should not reward free throws.</p>

      <label for="ll57b43" class="commentText"><p>Every single example you just named is basically saying &ldquo;don&rsquo;t punish bad defense&rdquo; and I really don&rsquo;t feel like that&rsquo;s a change that is good for the game in any way&hellip; except maybe the thing with initiating contact but that is basically already called that way, like it&rsquo;s not like you are getting foul calls for just running into defenders.</p>

<p>Like there is only a handful of guys who are actually good enough to bait fouls like that, with mostly guys like Luka, Shai etc.</p>

<p>The biggest reason why there is so much scoring today is that more players give less effort on defense because when you are better than your opponent you&rsquo;ll generate more points than them if you focus on offense especially with today&rsquo;s pace and also for most regular season games a lot of superstars save energy to be 100% for the playoffs.</p>

<p>If you look at the playoff average points we are between 100 and 110 for the entire last decade (which is basically the same as the 80s) and I genuinely don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a bad range and we see plenty of defensive master classes just not as much in the regular season.</p>

      <label for="ll5a2zx" class="commentText"><p>Fair but the response to bad defense shouldn&rsquo;t be bad offense purely with intent to get to the line and not actually produce a quality look. A defender simply having an arm out isn&rsquo;t bad defense. What else are they supposed to do? Its on the offensive player to navigate around that, not by pulling up to shoot directly through the forearm/elbow. The reward for getting your defender airborne should be a more open look after they fly by. Not free throws.</p>

<p>Another issue is when I see guys give genuine effort to defend and then getting punished for the absolute softest of calls when they do. Let them play.</p>

<p>I can agree that the playoffs are officiated much closer to what I think is ideal.  If the regular season were officiated more like the playoffs it would go a long way.</p>

<p>Plus in the playoffs when the games really matter they do let the defense be more physical and the score does come down closer to 100 anyways.</p>

Think of how long some of those baseline closeouts would become, and how much farther you&rsquo;d have to come off your man to play help defence.</p>

<p>I actually don’t mind this for a few reasons</p>

<ol>
<li>The great shooters will adjust and keep shooting</li>
<li>Watching dudes like Embiid or Giannis or other athletic freaks shoot threes is whatever.  If it stops marginal shooters from extending out it’s better for the game imo</li>
<li>Related to #1, you’ll still have to guard the great shooters.  This will have the added benefit of opening up more slashing lanes which creates excitement</li>

      <label for="ll2fdvb" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think the point differential you point out is an issue with the quality of the game. I do think they need to allow defenders to defend and they are taking that away. I do not want to see the 3 pt line moved back.  There is no way to move the corner 3 back  without eliminating it. The style of play will change. It was always obvious that you could score more points making 3s at a lower percentage than 2s, but for years, coaches didn&rsquo;t let their players shoot 3s in volume until some teams started providing a proof of concept which other teams adopted and expanded.</p>

      <label for="ll4fkce" class="commentText"><p>Everyone wants the game to be &ldquo;more physical&rdquo; and wants to see fewer fouls called until the team they&rsquo;re a fan of loses, then it&rsquo;ll turn into them complaining about &ldquo;blatant no-calls&rdquo; and free throw disparity.</p>

<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t think people understand what hand-checking actually is when they think it&rsquo;ll make some huge difference as to how much teams score. It&rsquo;s not like guys just didn&rsquo;t score on isos in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. There was definitely more physical play allowed (particularly in the paint and in scuffles) but it wasn&rsquo;t like they were playing jail ball in the 90s, especially early 90s.</p>

<p>The biggest reason for the scoring explosion is the emphasis on spacing (along with 3 point shooting) and skillset. When you have 4-5 guys on the floor at all times who can shoot a 3 as well as pass, dribble, and shoot, the odds of getting 3 points instead of 2 is drastically higher than it was 30 years ago. Also, more space (not just horizontally, but vertically, since shooting 28-foot shots is normal now) opens up so many driving and passing opportunities that didn&rsquo;t exist before. A minor change in rules won&rsquo;t change how teams play dramatically. It&rsquo;ll never go back to scores of 95-90 on the regular because the game has just moved past that point.</p>

<p>In the actual NBA rulebook, many rules are unchanged from what they&rsquo;ve been for decades. The difference is in how they&rsquo;re enforced. The NFL has actually had a ton of rule changes to actively strip away defense and emphasize offense (although defenses are catching up now finally).</p>

<p>if you consume any amount of nba content on social media or even on reddit, you&rsquo;d notice most of the stuff is some form of a stephen a smith, nba on tnt, skip bayless, or random blog boy hot take regurgitation.</p>

<p>moving the 3pt line back?</p>

<ul>
<li>more spacing and more scoring probably. guys can already shoot from multiple ft behind the line</li>
</ul>

<p>more physical defense?</p>

<ul>
<li>this can go either way, but with FTA per game per 100 possessions as low as they&rsquo;ve ever been, i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a huge issue</li>
</ul>

<p>guys are just too good at scoring now in the nba, and it&rsquo;s been incredible to watch. i think if the nba was covered differently, we wouldn&rsquo;t have so many posts and people complaining that there&rsquo;s something wrong with the league that needs to be changed. we see it at least once a week on this sub.</p>

<li>Nope lmao I just watch the games I’m not sure what’s crazy about only watching the games.</li>
<li>I don’t form my opinions based on Stephen A Smith and Skip Bayless. I feel like you are arguing with a hypothetical person and not me because like I said before, I enjoy the product I just wish we allowed for more defense.</li>
<li>I think not calling touch fouls, calling carries, and ultimately allowing the defender to play more physical defense would definitely bring a more interesting balance to the game.</li>

<p>a large percentage of the coverage is some form of &ldquo;they couldn&rsquo;t have done this back in the day because it was much tougher.&rdquo; kg just had a comment the other day saying there&rsquo;s not a single guy in the league now who could play in the league 20 years ago because of physicality. that&rsquo;s what i mean.</p>

<p>skip bayless&rsquo; whole schtick is that mj</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to move the 3 point line back without eliminating corner 3s—and that would completely change the game TBH</p>

<p>I would argue the NBA ramps up physicality allowed in the playoffs anyway</p>

<p>The reason scores have skyrocketed has less to do with rules/the NBA and more to do with increased shooting skill in the league and coaches adopting the &ldquo;pace and space&rdquo; era—more teams pushing the pace, and teams having multiple shooters that spread the floor and unclog the paint.</p>

<p>Rather than moving the line or reintroducing hand checking (which sucks) , I&rsquo;d say shrink the paint and let defenders bump when both going to a spot. That ridiculous drive, bump, flail is insane, let the contact happen.</p>

<p>The craziest idea, which would change the aesthetic/strategy to better incentivize middies/post play would be changing the points. Make 2s worth 3 and 3s worth 4. This would ruin scores/points/averages and historic comps. But right now, a 33% 3fg is comparable to a 50% 2fg. Changing the values makes it 38% 3fg to equal 50% 2fg. Worth it if you&rsquo;re elite, but nowhere near what it is.</p>

<p>Except they didn&rsquo;t, the reason the rules changed to stop letting talentless bums beat up on guys who could score was David Stern was smart enough to notice fans loved the Suns style of offense and how the ratings for their games were high, especially after the Spurs v Pistons Finals no one watched, he knew what fans wanted and gave it to them</p>

<p>Without Stern taking the league in this direction you would not have Steph Curry and all these guys electrifying the league with their scoring, you say the league was better back then but the ratings disagree with you</p>

      <label for="ll4ly79" class="commentText"><p>I’d be rly curious to see how much “foul baiting” is truly hurting the league now. In reality the amount of total fouls per season has, if anything, decreased since the 80s and 90s. Looking at the top individual free throw attempt seasons ever, only 4 of the top 25 came in the 2000s(and one was shaq in 2000). Id also argue the “lack of defense” as much as it can be attributed to a different whistle, is equally as attributable to better individual and team offenses that force more spacing which is inherently better for scoring.</p>

<p>All that said, I very much remember when scores were in the 90s-low 100s in the 90s through the 00s.</p>

<p>The game is so much better now. It’s much more exciting, there’s a lot more playmaking, there’s more focus on novel offensive and defensive strategies. The players are smarter and have greater all around skills. The game is just straight up better now. Anyone who thinks they want to go back, just wasn’t watching basketball then.</p>

I think they started doing that after the allstar break last year, and it was a step in the right direction.</p>

And I think a lot more of the world agrees with my taste. Basketball and NBA in particular, have never been more popular across the world.</p>

<p>NBA  can still do some of the things you mentioned while still favoring  skill over sheer body mass based game. Call carries and travels properly (that is, according to the rules).  Stop calling fouls on defenders in the paint for merely breathing in the direction of the offensive player. Reduce the number of timeouts at the end of the game. Etc. Use post game reviews to call out flopping players and attach some meaningful  penalty to that (not money). Maybe playoff tie breakers or draft probabilities etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot more that can be done without calling for &ldquo;more physical play&rdquo;. Nobody wants wrestling matches on the court.</p>

<p>Moving the 3pt line back is not nearly as easy as you think. Unless you are ok with the 3pt line ending near the edges (which imo would be a horrible change). The only way you can do it otherwise is to widen the court, which will give offenses even more space.</p>

      <label for="ll4rc1t" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m curious how everyone who says to penalize the offensive player trying to initiate contact would like to see that officiated. My favorite team is the Hawks and Trae is one of the biggest offenders of the whole throw yourself into the defense to draw a foul.</p>

<p>The one I totally understand is when the defense is playing solid defense either to the front or side of him, and he throws himself into their chest and then goes into a jump shot. That I feel should be a no call/offensive foul 100% of the time.</p>

<p>The one I&rsquo;m less sold on is when he makes a nice move and gets in front of the defender and the defender tries to trail him from right behind so he pulls up and the defender runs into him for a foul on his jump shot. This is still technically him &ldquo;initiating the contact&rdquo; but I feel like if the defender gets beat, the offense should be allowed to take a jump shot from anywhere and it&rsquo;s on the defender to make sure they don&rsquo;t run into him.</p>

      <label for="ll5qbin" class="commentText"><p>Watch a full game.</p>

<p>It’s still physical (although some officiating favors offenses) but the main difference between now and then is HOW they play defense.</p>

<p>Back in the late 90s and 2000s, it was way easier to man up because most offenses employed HEAVY iso-ball (Tim Duncan post-ups, Mid-post Kobe, AI &amp; T-Mac attacking from the wings) It’s easier to defend the other 4 players on the court because they were basically passive non-threats without the ball.</p>

<p>Whereas, if you watched a game post-<sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub>. Most offenses employed a-lot of ball &amp; player movement along with improved spacing. A lot of physical and MENTAL stamina is needed to guard the ENTIRE team all at the same time.</p>

<p>Kobe said it best when he analyzed the 2017 Warriors on his show: Details.
To paraphase, he said: “The Warriors were hard to defend not only because they had immense talent, but because their player and ball movement makes ALL their players a threat even WITHOUT the ball and their spacing makes it so hard to recover or double)</p>

<p>Even the teams who played heliocentric like the current Mavs benefit from the complexity of today’s schemes. It’s much harder to guard a Luka Doncic DHO into spain PnR from the top while the weak side is conjuring an exit screen for a shooter than it is guarding an Allen Iverson 1-on-1 specifically because everyone is a threat.</p>

<p>Boston’s 5 out scheme is a prime example of why scoring has BOOMED the past few years.
Having 5 shooters at all times makes the paint less congested and allows for easier cuts &amp; easier drives. Contrast that to the 2000s when they were still playing 2 NON-SHOOTING bigs congesting the paint.</p>

<p>I truly empathize  with you, I miss grind it out games that get rough.
But today’s defenders have it much harder due to factors such as spacing, movement and skill.</p>

<p>Physicality was there because it was one of the few ways you could stop a great ISO scorer, but now since there are less isolations; proper team defense, positioning and defensive IQ is much more necessary than brute physicality.</p>

      <label for="ll6r078" class="commentText"><p>I definitely think we&rsquo;re due for a return to hand-checking and a re-emphasis on calling moving screens and carrying.  We don&rsquo;t need to revert to 1980s carrying rules, but I thought the league was better when Iverson&rsquo;s level of carrying was considered the edge of what you could do.  It&rsquo;s gotten fucking ridiculous and these games are hard to watch now as compared to just 10 years ago.</p>

      <label for="ll71fnv" class="commentText"><p>I really enjoyed watching the Olympic Games &amp; the officiating on the defensive end. It amplified the tenacity of both teams &amp; the games didn’t have too many stoppages. Some pretty cool action packed moments.</p>

      <label for="ll91brs" class="commentText"><p>The league started to adjust officiating towards a more defensive game at the end of last season. If they keep going a bit I think thats the sweet spot.</p>
