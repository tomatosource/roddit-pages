</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In their head to head matchups. Magic got the better of Larry. 80s Lakers was 2-1 in Finals against Celtics too in that decade.</p>

<p>But I wonder if some people feel Magic had the advantage of having literally another Top 5 all time player in Kareem in his side. Albeit, a little older. Still, an MVP candidate. And they still have Worthy, Cooper, Scott, etc.</p>

<p>Larry, on the other hand has no teammate that will be even considered a Top 30 all time player.</p>

<p>His best teammates were Mchale, Parish, DJ, and an Old Bill Walton.  All great players. But not even in Top 30 players all time by most people.</p>

<p>I still have Magic slightly ahead of Larry in my all time ranking.</p>

<p>But I admire Larry battling two  arguably top 5 all time players. Without having the same caliber teammates.</p>

<p>Dont get me wrong</p>

<p>Celtics were strong too. But again only Larry Bird was a top 10 all time player.</p>

      <label for="lriy41j" class="commentText"><p>Many people considered Kevin McHale that best power forward in the NBA during his prime in Boston and others also argued that he was arguably the greatest power forward ever too, until he was eventually surprassed by other players at his position.</p>

<p>So even if Magic had Kareem Larry had McHale who was as good as it got during the 80&rsquo;s imo.  He also had Robert Parish who was voted as one of the 50 and 75 greatest players ever just like James Worthy.</p>

<p>As a die-hard Pistons fan since the early 80&rsquo;s if you didn&rsquo;t include the best referee whistle (Bird) that I&rsquo;ve ever seen, I used to be more worried and afraid for McHale to get the ball than Bird, even though he was the better and greater player, but it was virtually impossible to guard or stop McHale once he got the ball in the midrange, mid post and low post.</p>

<p>Kevin McHale is one of the absolute greatest players that I&rsquo;ve ever seen play professional team sports.</p>

      <label for="lrk14uc" class="commentText"><p>Mchale was called &ldquo;the black hole&rdquo; because once he got the ball in the post it was never getting back out lol.</p>

<p>He shot like 60% and No one had a comparable arsenal of post moves aside from olajuwon.</p>

<p>On a side note, crazy how both olajuwon and mchale personally trained Dwight Howard, and he still couldn&rsquo;t really develop well.</p>

<p>Dwight didn&rsquo;t have that real soft touch and isn&rsquo;t quite the cerebral player imo.</p>

      <label for="lriwon0" class="commentText"><p>Very early on, maybe a <em>little</em>, but Kareem was basically at the end of his prime when Magic was drafted. A 33-year-old Kareem in 1980 is pretty fuckin&rsquo; different from a 38-year-old Kareem in 1985</p>

<p>If I <em>had</em> to argue for an asterisk to Magic&rsquo;s career (which, to be clear, I think is a dumb idea, but we&rsquo;re talking gun-to-the-head here), it&rsquo;d be that the Western Conference was the weaker conference by a considerable margin during the &lsquo;80s. Basically the same argument as with LeBron in the East, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to get brought up nearly as much</p>

<p>(And, to be clear: I think Bird was better than Magic, peak-for-peak. Obviously I&rsquo;m a little biased on that point, they&rsquo;re basically neck-and-neck regardless. I just don&rsquo;t think devaluing Magic&rsquo;s accomplishments for having Kareem on his team is a good argument)</p>

<p>Shaq&rsquo;s first season in LA would have been Magics age 37 season. I know Lebron/Curry/KD have warped our perspective on aging, but Magic would have been one of the very oldest players in the league. Prime Magic this was not</p>

<p>We also have an idea how Magic would have been because he made a comeback the season before and was not particularly good.</p>

<p>1981 Celtics</p>

<p>1982 Lakers</p>

<p>1983 76ers</p>

<p>1984 Celtics</p>

<p>1985 Lakers</p>

<p>1986 Celtics</p>

<p>1987-1988 Lakers</p>

<p>1989-1990 Pistons</p>

<p>1991-1993 Bulls</p>

<p>Before Magic retired, the Lakers made <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> nba finals and the other 3 times were rocket x2 and blazers (both lost).</p>

<p>Competitions in the east were far more difficult.</p>

<p>Celtics, pistons, and bulls are all dynasty teams and the 83 76ers is one of the greatest teams of all time</p>

      <label for="lrj2324" class="commentText"><p>No, not really. Both were absolutely incredible. Weirdly, Bird has better PR, maybe cause he was more of a scorer, maybe because he had more success as a coach, maybe because his stats translate better to the modern understanding of basketball, maybe cause he&rsquo;s white, maybe because of the HIV thing, but&hellip; I mean both were an absolute wonder to watch. Magic really extended Kareem&rsquo;s career. Kareem is on record saying that Magic helped him find the joy in basketball again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to see people put Bird in their top 10 but not Magic, and that&rsquo;s a dumb-ass thing to do. They&rsquo;re inseparable.</p>

      <label for="lrk9tj7" class="commentText"><p>Not gonna get into Magic vs Bird, but I do think a lot of folks don&rsquo;t realize Worthy was the second best player on the Lakers for much of that run. Kareem was great, but was declining every year, he was well into his 30s when Magic was drafted.</p>

      <label for="lrjtb0v" class="commentText"><p>People undervalue McHale.  That guy was a bucket.  As good as Bird was, often the smart play was to just feed McHale in the post and he’d score or get fouled 95% of the time no matter who was guarding him.</p>

<p>I know people like to take about different eras and on one hand, I’m not sure if McHale would have been THAT effective if teams had just doubled him hard and didn’t care about leaving a buncha 25% three point shooters open.  On the other hand, could DJ probably get to hitting 40% on 3s?   Yeah.  Would seeing Bird/McHale play a 2-man game have been horrifying?   Yeah.</p>

<p>I mean, who is guarding either of them?   Would they care about switches?   The Lakers would have put Cooper in there and he’d have been bodied aside.  Kareem could learn to defend the perimeter but Magic would have to lose about 25 pounds.</p>

      <label for="lrk6prv" class="commentText"><p>Lol I was so tempted to bring him in to this but decided not too as the Lebron cry babies will come running. But since you did lol, his percentage should actually be worse in that article, it is inflated by his terrible years in the western conference. If you take just his years in the East I believe there is only 1 season where the East had a better percentage and that was 08. Even with that though, you see that is was super top heavy w just 4 quality teams vs the wests stacked conference. What that article doesn’t go into is the actual percentage difference, there are years in the 80s West and 2010s East where there is a 10% (and higher if I remember correctly) gap in winning % between the conferences.</p>

      <label for="lrj3btp" class="commentText"><p>Kareem is pretty overrated by Reddit.</p>

<p>From what I understand an old Kareem and a prime mchale were more or less interchangeable.</p>

<p>Neither guy was an MVP level player at that point like the big 2 + Jordan, and people only really decided to make Kareem the GOAT in the 2010s because of “longetivity” or something which started to matter because people wanted a reason to say that Bron&amp;gt;Jordan.</p>

      <label for="lrk04jk" class="commentText"><p>The amount of credit Kareem gets as a washed 37 year old who put up <sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> per game is absolutely wild. You don&rsquo;t see people credit the 2020 Lakers chip to Dwight Howard, or use the 2006 Miami Heat ring to argue how Gary Payton is the best point guard. But somehow people think the 4th / 5th option who was only playing 25 mins a game is the reason the Lakers were winning in the 80s???</p>

      <label for="lrkdou0" class="commentText"><p>Statistically Kareem was terrific and was phenomenal through at least 85. The history books bare this out too, even those written before the rise of LeBrons longevity case. The reason Kareem wasn’t discussed as often is because he was hyper political and kind of a surly asshole. He pissed off all the sportswriters, while Magic was one of the greatest media darlings of all time. Then of course Magic was lifted to sainted status because he contracted what was a terminal illness and lost at least 5 years. (Please see the way weirdos have forgotten what a prick rapist Kobe was and has now been rebranded as a girldad.) As the media started confronting racism in America while LeBron was making his own longevity case, Kareem got a re-evaluation. Kareem also helped this argument by embracing the media and being a thought leader. So I’m not sure if he’s overrated but is now properly rated. He’s still not really considered the GOAT by anyone but has to be TOP 4 if you have LeBron 1 or 2 because their cases have similarities. He’s also got the 6 rings and 6 MVPs in addition to holding the scoring record for 30 years.</p>

<p>Anyways Bird over Magic for peak, but Magic over Bird for career.</p>
