</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In their head to head matchups. Magic got the better of Larry. 80s Lakers was 2-1 in Finals against Celtics too in that decade.</p>

<p>But I wonder if some people feel Magic had the advantage of having literally another Top 5 all time player in Kareem in his side. Albeit, a little older. Still, an MVP candidate. And they still have Worthy, Cooper, Scott, etc.</p>

<p>Larry, on the other hand has no teammate that will be even considered a Top 30 all time player.</p>

<p>His best teammates were Mchale, Parish, DJ, and an Old Bill Walton.  All great players. But not even in Top 30 players all time by most people.</p>

<p>I still have Magic slightly ahead of Larry in my all time ranking.</p>

<p>But I admire Larry battling two  arguably top 5 all time players. Without having the same caliber teammates.</p>

<p>Dont get me wrong</p>

<p>Celtics were strong too. But again only Larry Bird was a top 10 all time player.</p>

      <label for="lrix3zs" class="commentText"><p>Kareem was one of the greatest players ever, even in his later years with the Lakers.He provided a consistent offensive threat, a defensive anchor, and championship experience.  Having Kareem allowed Magic to focus on his playmaking and facilitating, knowing he had a reliable scorer to fall back on.</p>

      <label for="lriwon0" class="commentText"><p>Very early on, maybe a <em>little</em>, but Kareem was basically at the end of his prime when Magic was drafted. A 33-year-old Kareem in 1980 is pretty fuckin&rsquo; different from a 38-year-old Kareem in 1985</p>

<p>If I <em>had</em> to argue for an asterisk to Magic&rsquo;s career (which, to be clear, I think is a dumb idea, but we&rsquo;re talking gun-to-the-head here), it&rsquo;d be that the Western Conference was the weaker conference by a considerable margin during the &lsquo;80s. Basically the same argument as with LeBron in the East, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to get brought up nearly as much</p>

<p>(And, to be clear: I think Bird was better than Magic, peak-for-peak. Obviously I&rsquo;m a little biased on that point, they&rsquo;re basically neck-and-neck regardless. I just don&rsquo;t think devaluing Magic&rsquo;s accomplishments for having Kareem on his team is a good argument)</p>

      <label for="lriy41j" class="commentText"><p>Many people considered Kevin McHale that best power forward in the NBA during his prime in Boston and others also argued that he was arguably the greatest power forward ever too, until other players overtook him.</p>

<p>So even if Magic had Kareem Larry had McHale who was as good as it got during the 80&rsquo;s imo.  He also had Robert Parish who was voted as one of the 50 and 75 greatest players ever just like James Worthy.</p>
