</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In their head to head matchups. Magic got the better of Larry. 80s Lakers was 2-1 in Finals against Celtics too in that decade.</p>

<p>But I wonder if some people feel Magic had the advantage of having literally another Top 5 all time player in Kareem in his side. Albeit, a little older. Still, an MVP candidate. And they still have Worthy, Cooper, Scott, etc.</p>

<p>Larry, on the other hand has no teammate that will be even considered a Top 30 all time player.</p>

<p>His best teammates were Mchale, Parish, DJ, and an Old Bill Walton.  All great players. But not even in Top 30 players all time by most people.</p>

<p>I still have Magic slightly ahead of Larry in my all time ranking.</p>

<p>But I admire Larry battling two  arguably top 5 all time players. Without having the same caliber teammates.</p>

<p>Dont get me wrong</p>

<p>Celtics were strong too. But again only Larry Bird was a top 10 all time player.</p>

      <label for="lriy41j" class="commentText"><p>Many people considered Kevin McHale that best power forward in the NBA during his prime in Boston and others also argued that he was arguably the greatest power forward ever too, until he was eventually surprassed by other players at his position.</p>

<p>So even if Magic had Kareem Larry had McHale who was as good as it got during the 80&rsquo;s imo.  He also had Robert Parish who was voted as one of the 50 and 75 greatest players ever just like James Worthy.</p>

<p>As a die-hard Pistons fan since the early 80&rsquo;s if you didn&rsquo;t include the best referee whistle (Bird) that I&rsquo;ve ever seen, I used to be more worried and afraid for McHale to get the ball than Bird, even though he was the better and greater player, but it was virtually impossible to guard or stop McHale once he got the ball in the midrange, mid post and low post.</p>

<p>Kevin McHale is one of the absolute greatest players that I&rsquo;ve ever seen play professional team sports.</p>

      <label for="lrix3zs" class="commentText"><p>Kareem was one of the greatest players ever, even in his later years with the Lakers.He provided a consistent offensive threat, a defensive anchor, and championship experience.  Having Kareem allowed Magic to focus on his playmaking and facilitating, knowing he had a reliable scorer to fall back on.</p>

      <label for="lriwon0" class="commentText"><p>Very early on, maybe a <em>little</em>, but Kareem was basically at the end of his prime when Magic was drafted. A 33-year-old Kareem in 1980 is pretty fuckin&rsquo; different from a 38-year-old Kareem in 1985</p>

<p>If I <em>had</em> to argue for an asterisk to Magic&rsquo;s career (which, to be clear, I think is a dumb idea, but we&rsquo;re talking gun-to-the-head here), it&rsquo;d be that the Western Conference was the weaker conference by a considerable margin during the &lsquo;80s. Basically the same argument as with LeBron in the East, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to get brought up nearly as much</p>

<p>(And, to be clear: I think Bird was better than Magic, peak-for-peak. Obviously I&rsquo;m a little biased on that point, they&rsquo;re basically neck-and-neck regardless. I just don&rsquo;t think devaluing Magic&rsquo;s accomplishments for having Kareem on his team is a good argument)</p>

<p>Magic and Bird were both so great that I have them one after the other in rankings. I think Bird was slightly better, but there’s not much in it.</p>

<p>If there is a reason for saying Magic was better than Bird, it’s not that his superior team won more.</p>

      <label for="lrj2324" class="commentText"><p>No, not really. Both were absolutely incredible. Weirdly, Bird has better PR, maybe cause he was more of a scorer, maybe because he had more success as a coach, maybe because his stats translate better to the modern understanding of basketball, maybe cause he&rsquo;s white, maybe because of the HIV thing, but&hellip; I mean both were an absolute wonder to watch. Magic really extended Kareem&rsquo;s career. Kareem is on record saying that Magic helped him find the joy in basketball again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to see people put Bird in their top 10 but not Magic, and that&rsquo;s a dumb-ass thing to do. They&rsquo;re inseparable.</p>

<p>From what I understand an old Kareem and a prime mchale were more or less interchangeable.</p>

<p>Neither guy was an MVP level player at that point like the big 2 + Jordan, and people only really decided to make Kareem the GOAT in the 2010s because of “longetivity” or something which started to matter because people wanted a reason to say that Bron&amp;gt;Jordan.</p>
