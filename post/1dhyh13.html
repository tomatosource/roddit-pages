      <label for="l90dapx" class="commentText"><p>Arn Tellem (Pistons Vice Chairman and former agent of Kobe Bryant) wrote <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2024/06/16/jerry-west-arn-tellem-nba/74098954007/" target="_blank">an article about West for the Detroit Free Press. </a>It has a number of great stories, quotes, and wisdom from West, but my favorite was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most endearing thing about Jerry was his vulnerability, which he was never afraid to show. &ldquo;Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage,” he would say. “Truth and courage aren&rsquo;t always comfortable, but they&rsquo;re never weakness.&rdquo; It takes a true fighter to see vulnerability as a sign of strength.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That type of attitude will make people listen and trust you.</p>

      <label for="l90hrkt" class="commentText"><p>I love Jerry West. His NBA Legends Profile almost doesn&rsquo;t seem real:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A smallish youth, West didn’t make his junior high football, baseball or track teams. His only outlet was a basketball hoop nailed to a storage shed outside a neighbor’s house. The dirt-covered court became his domain. In the rainy spring he dribbled in mud. When it snowed West played wearing gloves. He practiced shooting until his fingers bled. He taught himself his quick shot release by bouncing the last dribble hard off the ground. Until he got it right, the ball would frequently hit and bruise his face. After practice he would listen to West Virginia basketball games on the radio.</p>

<p>West completely immersed himself in practice, often neglecting to eat. His mother lashed him when he showed up hours late for dinner and he became so thin that he had to receive vitamin injections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is actually a video of him giving some tips to Harrison Barnes where he tells him to do that hard dribble. I really like to see things like that come full circle. I&rsquo;ll try to find the clip.</p>

      <label for="l91hivw" class="commentText"><p>Not really sure it was plagiarism. Could just be a simple case of me reading more into Tellem&rsquo;s article than was intended. Tellem just generically described it as &ldquo;&hellip;he [West] would say.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not actually claiming West came up with it or that West took credit for it, although that was how I read it at first.</p>

<p>FWIW, just a little bit later in the article, Tellem talks about West&rsquo;s fondness of the Native American parable about The Two Wolves. Maybe West just sought out wisdom from outside sources, incorporated it into his personal outlook/system of values, and spread that to others that were interested.</p>

<p>It does just say that it&rsquo;s something he would quote a lot, not necessarily attributing it to him. Tellem likely wasn&rsquo;t aware of the origin.</p>

I think pat bev was not suiting up due to an injury. You can tell they were having a deep ass conversation as they head to the locker.</p>

<p>Seems like Jerry west was mentor to a lot of nba players. If he can talk to pat bev on a personal basis, he can def talk to pretty much any nba player.</p>

      <label for="l904hog" class="commentText"><p>Jerry chewed me out once when I was fitting him for a sport coat. I brought 5 different fitting jackets and he hated each one more than the last. He told me that if I couldn’t bother to bring options that had a chance of fitting he might as well just not go to the NBA 75 team brunch because obviously none of us cared if he looked like an idiot in the jacket. So I guess you could say Jerry really really cared about me too, in his own way of course.</p>

      <label for="l91f43l" class="commentText"><p>An interesting thing to think about is whether he’s the same guy if he’s not the logo? And to what extent is the league different with a different logo?</p>

<p>There’s probably some component of a life of service to the league that’s tied to him being represented in the logo.</p>

<p>He’s probably mostly the same guy but I think it’s inaccurate to attribute 0% of it to being the logo.</p>

<p>Probably one of those situations that has a component of luck/chance to it that ends up being a win-win for both sides.</p>

They’re under so much public pressure and get so much abuse already as part of their job that the “warm” in “warm demanding” is more relative. They’re usually not gonna get emotionally hurt over a coach peeling them out, you or I might cuz it would be so out of character for the AP history teacher to flip out and throw a chair across the hall</p>

      <label for="l91o7fp" class="commentText"><p>You need to give people a reason to listen to you.  In some cases, that might mean being &ldquo;warm&rdquo; &ndash; say, making someone feel welcomed through kindness.  In sports, I think you have to demonstrate that you aren&rsquo;t full of shit.  You can be a demanding asshole, but in the long run, your demands have to prove to be productive.  (Like Bobby Knight at Indiana from &lsquo;71-92 &ndash; just about every 4-year player would have made the final four, or at least multiple sweet 16 appearances.)  If it&rsquo;s obvious that what the players being asked to do isn&rsquo;t leading to wins, or even progress, then you come off as just an asshole who has no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about and the players will rightfully just start tuning you out.</p>

<p>But sports give you real objective feedback through wins and losses, league standings, times on a stopwatch, etc.  Anything more subjective than that and I think it&rsquo;s hard to get very far by being the demanding asshole because you need the student to believe your demands are worth following and I think it tends to be hard to do that if you&rsquo;re an asshole.  It&rsquo;s not impossible, but threading the needle of being harsh and respected is easier said than done.</p>

      <label for="l92gtmb" class="commentText"><p>I had a guide counselor like this in high school and I credit her for saving my life. She saw shit in me I didn&rsquo;t see in myself and she was one of the first adults to treat with with warmness and respect but also making me hold myself to a higher standard.</p>

<p>I had a turbulent home life with my dad being an abusive alcoholic and my mom going through cancer as well as me going through depression. She took me under her wing and I took the SATs and got a 2030 out of 2400 on my first try. I was satisfied with that when college offers started coming through. I remember she pushed me to take it the second time but I kind of flauntered on it. The night before the second SAT, she called my mom and told her the situation. My mom was upset but told her she didn&rsquo;t have the funds immediately ready for me to just take the test. I think it was like $100 to register for the test.</p>

<p>This lady showed up at my house at 7:00 am, gave me a personal check, drove me to the testing center to make sure I went and said I better get a spot for the test and do my best because she&rsquo;s not wasting this money on bullshit. There were 2 open spots and I ended up getting a 2380 out of 2400 on my second try. Got a full ride to college then a full ride to law school because of what she did for my family and I. She was at both graduations and framed the $100 bill I nominally repaid her back that&rsquo;s still hanging in her office.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the show, but the way they showed him was clearly for entertainment purposes; it’s more fun to see the outward actions than to guess what’s going on in his head. </p>

      <label for="l912uh3" class="commentText"><p>It’s one of the more nuanced parts of leadership that can go wrong really quickly.</p>

<p>You can’t just be a hardass just to be a hardass, you have to build a relationship with people or have a certain amount of respect from your subordinates for it to work.  When your boss constantly praises you for your accomplishments but gives you harsh feedback when you fuck up badly, I feel like you actually will be willing to look at yourself and say “well yeah, actually this was my fault, so how can I improve?”</p>

<p>Where people go wrong with being hardass is just constantly focusing on every little thing they do wrong and being a constant hardass, to the point where you just tune them out.  If all the feedback is negative, at a certain point you just realize that you’re most likely never going to be able to make the person happy.</p>

<p>I think Bill Belichick in the NFL is a good example, and a lot of his assistants that went on to be head coaches with other teams are the bad examples (Patricia and McDaniels in general).</p>

<p>It’s not a leadership style I think works for like 99.99% of people and requires a truly transcendent leader to actually be effective.  Someone is technically brilliant and also has an extremely high emotional intelligence, you have to know when to rein it in and when to actually apply it.</p>

<p>Edit: for all the triggered macho men this is also an example of cognitive dissonance. You have two conflicting thoughts with an abusive coach. My coach is an asshole that&rsquo;s affecting my mental health, and I don&rsquo;t want to fail at playing this sport. So instead of rationalizing the latter thought you rationalize the first one that you can&rsquo;t really change anyway by saying it&rsquo;s tough love and it&rsquo;s actually beneficial to my success. It&rsquo;s why the frat-stars that get hazed the hardest are the most proud &lsquo;I would not have subjected myself to that kind of humiliation unless it was worth it&rsquo;</p>

      <label for="l91edqj" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. Seeing something like this where Jerry got the most out of Joe and pushed him to be better and automatically thinking that he SHOULDN&rsquo;T do that on the off chance that it might hurt his feelings is crazy. This wasn&rsquo;t a middle school situation, so why apply it to one? There is a balance, but trying to push someone to do more because you believe they can do more shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as a bad thing. It&rsquo;s a weird thing that people have where they apply this situation to their own middle or high school career when it isn&rsquo;t remotely the same scenario.</p>

<p>If you act disrespectful as hell to somebody trying to help you and looking to offer you support on a pretty personal level, you probably need someone to let you know that what you are doing isn&rsquo;t acceptable and wasn&rsquo;t going to get you where you want to be.</p>

<p>Being told to do better isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;abuse&rsquo; either, even if it is in tough language. It was also a speech given privately, 1v1 in a phone call. If this breaks you, you were never destined for the greatness he was trying to push you towards</p>

<p>So the act itself of Jerry West calling some college kid out of the blue puts it in a different context because he is putting in the effort and making time to talk to this kid that he has no power over zero obligation to talk to. There are a million “more important” things Jerry west could have been doing with his time but he cared enough to spend it giving advice to a college kid he didn’t know. The phone call itself is a sign of huge respect, which allows him to be more aggressive with the message.</p>

<p>It’s not like a coach who sees the kid every day and has absolute power over his future as a player and is choosing to make the kids life miserable.</p>

Just because some people might not have succeeded, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more on them for being unwilling to do the work than it was on Jerry for being hard on them.</p>

      <label for="l91he4x" class="commentText"><p>In general I agree, but this seems like just a case of West yelling at him when he was being lazy (and staying at West&rsquo;s house) and getting into legal trouble.</p>

<p>Cases where it&rsquo;s Roy Jones Jr or Tua Tagovailoa are different, that&rsquo;s more when I think of survivorship bias coming in of kids being abused and still making it to the top of the sport.  Most kids don&rsquo;t have the talent (the HBO doc Trophy Kids is a good example) and don&rsquo;t make it to the top.  Or they may have the talent but end up self medicating the trauma like Todd Marinovich.</p>

      <label for="l91bb57" class="commentText"><p>100% agree. Nobody can take being yelled at anymore, I don&rsquo;t know why. Obviously, yelling isn&rsquo;t great if you&rsquo;re a parent, teacher, or a coach if that is all you do.</p>

<p>However, in the real world, sometimes people get pissed off and they yell. What are you going to do? Are you going to roll up in a ball and just shut yourself down? Or are you going to accept it, move on, and get better.</p>

<p>I got downvoted to hell because Bryce Harper (MLB Player) went ape shit on equipment in the dugout. A commenter said that it was unacceptable, and that it triggered some trauma they had as a child, and that Bryce needs to remember that he is a role model. I said this is pro sports, and sometimes people yell, scream, and bash equipment, we&rsquo;re all going to be okay.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Tom Brady scream. I&rsquo;ve seen Peyton Manning scream. I&rsquo;ve seen MJ and Kobe yell. Sometimes leadership requires yelling, lighting a fire, and being the unpopular person in the room. For the record, the last dynasty in the NBA is the Warriors. Steve Kerr yells and gets pissed off. Sometimes leadership can be ugly.</p>

      <label for="l91tese" class="commentText"><p>Everyone responds differently to different leadership styles and part of being a good leader is finding the styles that work best for each person. Yelling doesn&rsquo;t work with me. If it&rsquo;s directed at me and I feel like it&rsquo;s unwarranted, I will challenge it. Otherwise I will ignore it since I don&rsquo;t need some loudmouth bullshit to get myself fired up.</p>

<p>OP didn&rsquo;t specify that you tell someone they are fucking up by yelling though. I can take criticism just fine, just not when it&rsquo;s in the form of yelling.</p>

      <label for="l91uzxz" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not saying yelling is a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo;. I understand a lot of people don&rsquo;t respond well to it, and you are correct that some people need an arm around the shoulder, and not a kick in the ass. Also, please don&rsquo;t confuse abuse with what I&rsquo;m talking about here. I&rsquo;m not talking about the abusive alcoholic dad who comes home and yells every night.</p>

<p>What I am saying is sometimes in high leverage situations when something important is on the line, someone in a position of power may yell.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in an OR and a surgeon needs something and you fuck it up putting the patient at risk, sorry, he may yell at you.</p>

<p>If you work at a tech company and you&rsquo;re working on a new release and royally fuck up and now the release is in jeopardy, your boss might yell.</p>

<p>Rolling up into a ball and saying that &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t respond to yelling&rdquo; in those situations is not going to help you. In the real world, when people get upset and something important is on the line, they may raise their voice and tell you to get your shit together.</p>

      <label for="l90jopf" class="commentText"><p>While the portrayal of West on Winning Time was obviously exaggerated so that it&rsquo;d work better for screen, these are the types of stories that tell me that the portrayal may not have been as far from reality as certain people have suggested. A lot of people have described West as a tough-love kind of guy who absolutely hated losing and losing mentality. The show just seemed to externalize a lot of things that West mostly internalized, because again, that works better for a visual medium like Television. </p>

<p>I always doubted that many people associated with the Lakers, including West, watched more than the first episode or some sporadic clips, and thus missed the full character arc portrayed. I genuinely think the show potrayed him really positively.</p>

      <label for="l9118nu" class="commentText"><p>I was once Jerry West’s Uber driver.  I stopped at a yellow light out of an abundance of caution.  Jerry wasn’t having it.</p>

<p>He raged: “why are you in this business, if you don’t even try to make those?”</p>

<p>I tried to explain to him I prioritized safety but he told me, “take a risk for once in your life, asshole.”</p>

<p>I began tearing up and having so much trouble seeing the road that I had to pull over.  At that point Jerry changed his tone and said “hey, I just want you to be the best version of yourself that you can be, that’s the only way to live.”</p>

<p>That just really brought up so much for me.  We’re pulled over on the side of the road in Kennelsworth, Iowa and I’m just sobbing thinking about my father.  It took me 10 min to pull myself together and he was incredibly gracious.  At one point we got out of the car and he gave me a long hug.  I’m 99% sure it was Jerry West.  RIP to a legend</p>
