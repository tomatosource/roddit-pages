<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most endearing thing about Jerry was his vulnerability, which he was never afraid to show. &ldquo;Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage,” he would say. “Truth and courage aren&rsquo;t always comfortable, but they&rsquo;re never weakness.&rdquo; It takes a true fighter to see vulnerability as a sign of strength.</p>

      <label for="l90hrkt" class="commentText"><p>I love Jerry West. His NBA Legends Profile almost doesn&rsquo;t seem real:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A smallish youth, West didn’t make his junior high football, baseball or track teams. His only outlet was a basketball hoop nailed to a storage shed outside a neighbor’s house. The dirt-covered court became his domain. In the rainy spring he dribbled in mud. When it snowed West played wearing gloves. He practiced shooting until his fingers bled. He taught himself his quick shot release by bouncing the last dribble hard off the ground. Until he got it right, the ball would frequently hit and bruise his face. After practice he would listen to West Virginia basketball games on the radio.</p>

<p>West completely immersed himself in practice, often neglecting to eat. His mother lashed him when he showed up hours late for dinner and he became so thin that he had to receive vitamin injections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is actually a video of him giving some tips to Harrison Barnes where he tells him to do that hard dribble. I really like to see things like that come full circle. I&rsquo;ll try to find the clip.</p>

He told me that if I couldn’t bother to bring options that had a chance of fitting he might as well just not go to the NBA 75 team brunch because obviously none of us cared if he looked like an idiot in the jacket.

      <label for="l90c98g" class="commentText"><p>I was at that game in Syracuse NY. Kentucky had beaten Cornell, my son’s  Alma Mater. But we decided to go to the elite 8 game anyway, since we had the tickets as part of the package. Kentucky was bottled up inside and just chucked up one brick after another from 3. Huge upset, given the future pros Kentucky had on the roster.</p>

They’re under so much public pressure and get so much abuse already as part of their job that the “warm” in “warm demanding” is more relative. They’re usually not gonna get emotionally hurt over a coach peeling them out, you or I might cuz it would be so out of character for the AP history teacher to flip out and throw a chair across the hall</p>

<p>Additionally, the ones that do fit that mold are generally things that he admits were failures on his part. They are generally pointed to in order to illustrate his humanity and how his own emotional trauma could created problems for himself and those around him.</p>

<p>Seeing the problems that caused and how he worked to overcome those failings isn&rsquo;t something that I view as making him look like &ldquo;an absolute fucking asshole.&rdquo; To me, those failures help to humanize him and make it easier for people like me to relate to him.</p>

<p>&hellip;and? Everyone is an asshole at some point in their lives. That is hardly proof that almost every story about them make them seem like an asshole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ok, so support that with some examples.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Look, I&rsquo;m on board with the idea that people should generally take the high road. I&rsquo;m on board with the idea that taking some shots at a guy can be petty, even if he started shit with you first. With that said, it was pretty low-level shit talk.</p>

<p>Even if I&rsquo;d rather that West bit his tongue, it seems a little extreme to frame it as making him &ldquo;seem like an absolute fucking asshole.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the hardsss mentoring he did, which if he was a role player and talked the way he did, I&rsquo;d imagine the perception of him wouldn&rsquo;t be that great.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as those stories making him &ldquo;seem like an absolute fucking asshole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being honest with people that are legit fucking up generally isn&rsquo;t an asshole move, so long as you are coming from a positive place where you want them to do better. Yeah, if he wasn&rsquo;t Jerry West, people might not listen to him, but that wouldn&rsquo;t make him &ldquo;an absolute fucking asshole.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This story</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing. Mazzulla seems to view the exchange as one that had a positive influence on his life. Mazzulla felt love from West and believes that West helped him. What part of that specifically makes him &ldquo;seem lake an absolute fucking asshole&rdquo;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also reflecting on mistakes is a great thing, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean those mistakes didn&rsquo;t happen, and when it&rsquo;d be so easy to just change the way you talk so you aren&rsquo;t being such a hardass when mentoring it really does take away from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was talking more about how his deep depression and emotional trauma contributed to his divorce. I guess if you think that deep, lifelong depression is an easy thing to solve though, then we might not be able to make much progress here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like it takes more effort to go out of your way to be a hardass than it does to just use positive reinforcement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all people respond the same to different motivational approaches. Seriously, did you listen to the story? He was letting Mazzulla stay at his house so that he could have more opportunities to achieve his dreams. Mazzulla effectively slapped him in the face by not even waking up on time to get to practice. Inviting someone into your home to stay with you so they can have chances to improve themselves is a pretty positive approach, IMO.</p>

<p>Maybe that, plus the way Mazzulla recounts the story, should give us a clue that Mazzulla needed a hardass to call him out on his bullshit.</p>

<p>Edit: for all the triggered macho men this is also an example of cognitive dissonance. You have two conflicting thoughts with an abusive coach. My coach is an asshole that&rsquo;s affecting my mental health, and I don&rsquo;t want to fail at playing this sport. So instead of rationalizing the latter thought you rationalize the first one that you can&rsquo;t really change anyway by saying it&rsquo;s tough love and it&rsquo;s actually beneficial to my success. It&rsquo;s why the frat-stars that get hazed the hardest are the most proud &lsquo;I would not have subjected myself to that kind of humiliation unless it was worth it&rsquo;</p>

<p>Being told to do better isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;abuse&rsquo; either, even if it is in tough language. It was also a speech given privately, 1v1 in a phone call. If this breaks you, you were never destined for the greatness he was trying to push you towards</p>

      <label for="l90njf6" class="commentText"><p>Ok but Jerry wasn’t his coach, he was an alumni from the same school and absolute legend of the game.</p>

<p>So the act itself of Jerry West calling some college kid out of the blue puts it in a different context because he is putting in the effort and making time to talk to this kid that he has no power over zero obligation to talk to. There are a million “more important” things Jerry west could have been doing with his time but he cared enough to spend it giving advice to a college kid he didn’t know. The phone call itself is a sign of huge respect, which allows him to be more aggressive with the message.</p>

<p>It’s not like a coach who sees the kid every day and has absolute power over his future as a player and is choosing to make the kids life miserable.</p>

      <label for="l90jopf" class="commentText"><p>While the portrayal of West on Winning Time was obviously exaggerated so that it&rsquo;d work better for screen, these are the types of stories that tell me that the portrayal may not have been as far from reality as certain people have suggested. A lot of people have described West as a tough-love kind of guy who absolutely hated losing and losing mentality. The show just seemed to externalize a lot of things that West mostly internalized, because again, that works better for a visual medium like Television. </p>

<p>I always doubted that many people associated with the Lakers, including West, watched more than the first episode or some sporadic clips, and thus missed the full character arc portrayed. I genuinely think the show potrayed him really positively.</p>

      <label for="l9118nu" class="commentText"><p>I was once Jerry West’s Uber driver.  I stopped at a yellow light out of an abundance of caution.  Jerry wasn’t having it.</p>

<p>He raged: “why are you in this business, if you don’t even try to make those?”</p>

<p>I tried to explain to him I prioritized safety but he told me, “take a risk for once in your life, asshole.”</p>

<p>I began tearing up and having so much trouble seeing the road that I had to pull over.  At that point Jerry changed his tone and said “hey, I just want you to be the best version of yourself that you can be, that’s the only way to live.”</p>

<p>That just really brought up so much for me.  We’re pulled over on the side of the road in Kennelsworth, Iowa and I’m just sobbing thinking about my father.  It took me 10 min to pull myself together and he was incredibly gracious.  At one point we got out of the car and he gave me a long hug.  I’m 99% sure it was Jerry West.  RIP to a legend</p>
