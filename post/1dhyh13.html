<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most endearing thing about Jerry was his vulnerability, which he was never afraid to show. &ldquo;Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage,” he would say. “Truth and courage aren&rsquo;t always comfortable, but they&rsquo;re never weakness.&rdquo; It takes a true fighter to see vulnerability as a sign of strength.</p>

      <label for="l90hrkt" class="commentText"><p>I love Jerry West. His NBA Legends Profile almost doesn&rsquo;t seem real:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A smallish youth, West didn’t make his junior high football, baseball or track teams. His only outlet was a basketball hoop nailed to a storage shed outside a neighbor’s house. The dirt-covered court became his domain. In the rainy spring he dribbled in mud. When it snowed West played wearing gloves. He practiced shooting until his fingers bled. He taught himself his quick shot release by bouncing the last dribble hard off the ground. Until he got it right, the ball would frequently hit and bruise his face. After practice he would listen to West Virginia basketball games on the radio.</p>

<p>West completely immersed himself in practice, often neglecting to eat. His mother lashed him when he showed up hours late for dinner and he became so thin that he had to receive vitamin injections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is actually a video of him giving some tips to Harrison Barnes where he tells him to do that hard dribble. I really like to see things like that come full circle. I&rsquo;ll try to find the clip.</p>

      <label for="l91hivw" class="commentText"><p>Not really sure it was plagiarism. Could just be a simple case of me reading more into Tellem&rsquo;s article than was intended. Tellem just generically described it as &ldquo;&hellip;he [West] would say.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not actually claiming West came up with it or that West took credit for it, although that was how I read it at first.</p>

<p>FWIW, just a little bit later in the article, Tellem talks about West&rsquo;s fondness of the Native American parable about The Two Wolves. Maybe West just sought out wisdom from outside sources, incorporated it into his personal outlook/system of values, and spread that to others that were interested.</p>

<p>With all the stories of how people remember Jerry West I always come back to this clip in PG&rsquo;s podcast. The NBA most certainly did right selecting Jerry West as their logo, even if it was just luck.</p>

      <label for="l91f43l" class="commentText"><p>An interesting thing to think about is whether he’s the same guy if he’s not the logo? And to what extent is the league different with a different logo?</p>

<p>There’s probably some component of a life of service to the league that’s tied to him being represented in the logo.</p>

<p>He’s probably mostly the same guy but I think it’s inaccurate to attribute 0% of it to being the logo.</p>

<p>Probably one of those situations that has a component of luck/chance to it that ends up being a win-win for both sides.</p>

      <label for="l912uh3" class="commentText"><p>It’s one of the more nuanced parts of leadership that can go wrong really quickly.</p>

<p>You can’t just be a hardass just to be a hardass, you have to build a relationship with people or have a certain amount of respect from your subordinates for it to work.  When your boss constantly praises you for your accomplishments but gives you harsh feedback when you fuck up badly, I feel like you actually will be willing to look at yourself and say “well yeah, actually this was my fault, so how can I improve?”</p>

<p>Where people go wrong with being hardass is just constantly focusing on every little thing they do wrong and being a constant hardass, to the point where you just tune them out.  If all the feedback is negative, at a certain point you just realize that you’re most likely never going to be able to make the person happy.</p>

<p>I think Bill Belichick in the NFL is a good example, and a lot of his assistants that went on to be head coaches with other teams are the bad examples (Patricia and McDaniels in general).</p>

<p>It’s not a leadership style I think works for like 99.99% of people and requires a truly transcendent leader to actually be effective.  Someone is technically brilliant and also has an extremely high emotional intelligence, you have to know when to rein it in and when to actually apply it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the ones that do fit that mold are generally things that he admits were failures on his part. They are generally pointed to in order to illustrate his humanity and how his own emotional trauma could created problems for himself and those around him.</p>

<p>Seeing the problems that caused and how he worked to overcome those failings isn&rsquo;t something that I view as making him look like &ldquo;an absolute fucking asshole.&rdquo; To me, those failures help to humanize him and make it easier for people like me to relate to him.</p>

<p>Also reflecting on mistakes is a great thing, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean those mistakes didn&rsquo;t happen, and when it&rsquo;d be so easy to just change the way you talk so you aren&rsquo;t being such a hardass when mentoring it really does take away from it.</p>

<p>Like it takes more effort to go out of your way to be a hardass than it does to just use positive reinforcement</p>

<p>&hellip;and? Everyone is an asshole at some point in their lives. That is hardly proof that almost every story about them make them seem like an asshole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ok, so support that with some examples.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Look, I&rsquo;m on board with the idea that people should generally take the high road. I&rsquo;m on board with the idea that taking some shots at a guy can be petty, even if he started shit with you first. With that said, it was pretty low-level shit talk.</p>

<p>Even if I&rsquo;d rather that West bit his tongue, it seems a little extreme to frame it as making him &ldquo;seem like an absolute fucking asshole.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the hardsss mentoring he did, which if he was a role player and talked the way he did, I&rsquo;d imagine the perception of him wouldn&rsquo;t be that great.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as those stories making him &ldquo;seem like an absolute fucking asshole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being honest with people that are legit fucking up generally isn&rsquo;t an asshole move, so long as you are coming from a positive place where you want them to do better. Yeah, if he wasn&rsquo;t Jerry West, people might not listen to him, but that wouldn&rsquo;t make him &ldquo;an absolute fucking asshole.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This story</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing. Mazzulla seems to view the exchange as one that had a positive influence on his life. Mazzulla felt love from West and believes that West helped him. What part of that specifically makes him &ldquo;seem lake an absolute fucking asshole&rdquo;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also reflecting on mistakes is a great thing, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean those mistakes didn&rsquo;t happen, and when it&rsquo;d be so easy to just change the way you talk so you aren&rsquo;t being such a hardass when mentoring it really does take away from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was talking more about how his deep depression and emotional trauma contributed to his divorce. I guess if you think that deep, lifelong depression is an easy thing to solve though, then we might not be able to make much progress here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like it takes more effort to go out of your way to be a hardass than it does to just use positive reinforcement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all people respond the same to different motivational approaches. Seriously, did you listen to the story? He was letting Mazzulla stay at his house so that he could have more opportunities to achieve his dreams. Mazzulla effectively slapped him in the face by not even waking up on time to get to practice. Inviting someone into your home to stay with you so they can have chances to improve themselves is a pretty positive approach, IMO.</p>

<p>Maybe that, plus the way Mazzulla recounts the story, should give us a clue that Mazzulla needed a hardass to call him out on his bullshit.</p>

Ask people in sports, the military or even in like trade work and physical labor. The love part of “tough love” shines through when it’s there, and the people that talk about Jerry West have made it clear the love was there. You just don’t like his way of doing things, doesn’t make him a massive asshole like you make it out to be.</p>

<p>Edit: for all the triggered macho men this is also an example of cognitive dissonance. You have two conflicting thoughts with an abusive coach. My coach is an asshole that&rsquo;s affecting my mental health, and I don&rsquo;t want to fail at playing this sport. So instead of rationalizing the latter thought you rationalize the first one that you can&rsquo;t really change anyway by saying it&rsquo;s tough love and it&rsquo;s actually beneficial to my success. It&rsquo;s why the frat-stars that get hazed the hardest are the most proud &lsquo;I would not have subjected myself to that kind of humiliation unless it was worth it&rsquo;</p>

Seeing something like this where Jerry got the most out of Joe and pushed him to be better and automatically thinking that he SHOULDN&rsquo;T do that on the off chance that it might hurt his feelings is crazy. This wasn&rsquo;t a middle school situation, so why apply it to one? There is a balance, but trying to push someone to do more because you believe they can do more shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as a bad thing. It&rsquo;s a weird thing that people have where they apply this situation to their own middle or high school career when it isn&rsquo;t remotely the same scenario.</p>

<p>So the act itself of Jerry West calling some college kid out of the blue puts it in a different context because he is putting in the effort and making time to talk to this kid that he has no power over zero obligation to talk to. There are a million “more important” things Jerry west could have been doing with his time but he cared enough to spend it giving advice to a college kid he didn’t know. The phone call itself is a sign of huge respect, which allows him to be more aggressive with the message.</p>

<p>It’s not like a coach who sees the kid every day and has absolute power over his future as a player and is choosing to make the kids life miserable.</p>

      <label for="l91he4x" class="commentText"><p>In general I agree, but this seems like just a case of West yelling at him when he was being lazy (and staying at West&rsquo;s house) and getting into legal trouble.</p>

<p>Cases where it&rsquo;s Roy Jones Jr or Tua Tagovailoa are different, that&rsquo;s more when I think of survivorship bias coming in of kids being abused and still making it to the top of the sport.  Most kids don&rsquo;t have the talent (the HBO doc Trophy Kids is a good example) and don&rsquo;t make it to the top.  Or they may have the talent but end up self medicating the trauma like Todd Marinovich.</p>

      <label for="l90obly" class="commentText"><p>Sometimes, there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of value in somebody telling you that you&rsquo;re really fucking up, if the person being told is able to be mature enough to take in that information.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the amount of people being able to take this type of stern criticism is shrinking by the minute.</p>

      <label for="l91bb57" class="commentText"><p>100% agree. Nobody can take being yelled at anymore, I don&rsquo;t know why. Obviously, yelling isn&rsquo;t great if you&rsquo;re a parent, teacher, or a coach if that is all you do.</p>

<p>However, in the real world, sometimes people get pissed off and they yell. What are you going to do? Are you going to roll up in a ball and just shut yourself down? Or are you going to accept it, move on, and get better.</p>

<p>I got downvoted to hell because Bryce Harper (MLB Player) went ape shit on equipment in the dugout. A commenter said that it was unacceptable, and that it triggered some trauma they had as a child, and that Bryce needs to remember that he is a role model. I said this is pro sports, and sometimes people yell, scream, and bash equipment, we&rsquo;re all going to be okay.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Tom Brady scream. I&rsquo;ve seen Peyton Manning scream. I&rsquo;ve seen MJ and Kobe yell. Sometimes leadership requires yelling, lighting a fire, and being the unpopular person in the room. For the record, the last dynasty in the NBA is the Warriors. Steve Kerr yells and gets pissed off. Sometimes leadership can be ugly.</p>

      <label for="l90jopf" class="commentText"><p>While the portrayal of West on Winning Time was obviously exaggerated so that it&rsquo;d work better for screen, these are the types of stories that tell me that the portrayal may not have been as far from reality as certain people have suggested. A lot of people have described West as a tough-love kind of guy who absolutely hated losing and losing mentality. The show just seemed to externalize a lot of things that West mostly internalized, because again, that works better for a visual medium like Television. </p>

<p>I always doubted that many people associated with the Lakers, including West, watched more than the first episode or some sporadic clips, and thus missed the full character arc portrayed. I genuinely think the show potrayed him really positively.</p>

<p>He raged: “why are you in this business, if you don’t even try to make those?”</p>

<p>I tried to explain to him I prioritized safety but he told me, “take a risk for once in your life, asshole.”</p>

<p>I began tearing up and having so much trouble seeing the road that I had to pull over.  At that point Jerry changed his tone and said “hey, I just want you to be the best version of yourself that you can be, that’s the only way to live.”</p>

<p>That just really brought up so much for me.  We’re pulled over on the side of the road in Kennelsworth, Iowa and I’m just sobbing thinking about my father.  It took me 10 min to pull myself together and he was incredibly gracious.  At one point we got out of the car and he gave me a long hug.  I’m 99% sure it was Jerry West.  RIP to a legend</p>
