      <label for="lod4lgl" class="commentText"><p>“It was retaliation after he hit me with an elbow,” Peeler said after the 104-87 win. “It’s always the guy that responds that is the one that gets suspended or ejected. So if I get suspended or ejected, I think that he should as well.”</p>

<p>KG was fined just $7,500 as Peeler was hit with a two-game suspension without pay.</p>

<p>“I’m surprised that it was a little dirty,” Garnett said about the punch. “I played with him a couple of years, so I know what kind of player he is. It was surprising, but I wasn’t going to let anybody just hit me. Never have, never will.”</p>

<p>“It’s Game 7, man. That’s it. It’s for all the marbles,” Garnett said. “Sitting in the house, I’m loading up the pump. I’m loading up the Uzi. I got a couple M-16s, a couple 9. I got a couple joints with some silencers on them. I’m just loading clips, a couple grenades. I got a missile launcher. I’m ready for war.”</p>

<p>In game 7, KG dropped 32 points, 21 rebounds, 5 blocks and 4 steals on the Peeler-less Kings; 15 of those 32 points came in the 4th quarter, which was more than all five of the King’s starter. As for those starters, Chris Webber had just 16 points, Peja Stojakovic missed 9 of 12 shots, Mike Bibby missed 9 of 13, Vlade Divac only had six boards and zero blocks and their leading scorer was Doug Christie with 21 points.</p>

<p>Wolves faced the Lakers in the WCF but ended up losing 4-2.</p>

        <div>1 | 15 minutes ago </div>
      </div>
      <label for="lodf6iq" class="commentText"><p>My hot take is that his moment had far greater implications for the trajectory of the Kings franchise than even the Lakers series a few years earlier. Re-posting a comment i&rsquo;ve made over the years.</p>

<hr>

<p>I&rsquo;ll speak on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az9fehCiG4w" target="_blank">Anthony Peeler vs. KG</a> incident as it was an important event that shaped the future of the Kings franchise.</p>

<p>In the previous year&rsquo;s playoffs, Chris Webber went down with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEjVtZ9cId0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=23s" target="_blank">knee injury</a> that required micro-fracture surgery. With their star player down, the Kings fell to the Mavs in the second round 4-2.</p>

<p>That off-season, the Kings signed Brad Miller and Anthony Peeler in free agency. Brad&rsquo;s incredible passing and shooting fit into the King&rsquo;s Princeton offense like a glove and ultimately resulted in an All-Star berth. Anthony Peeler was incredible as well, leading the league in 3pt FG% at 48% as a key player off the bench.</p>

<p>Due to Chris Webber&rsquo;s absence, Peja Stojakovic emerged as an MVP candidate. He finished second in the league in scoring (24.2ppg), first in 3pm (240, which was good for 3rd highest single season total at the time), and was 2nd team All-NBA. The Kings were firing on all cylinders and had the best record in the league with 23 games remaining in the regular season.</p>

<p>And then Chris Webber returned.</p>

<p>From the moment he set foot on the court, the Kings began to unravel. Webber was a shell of his former self and the great chemistry the team had was disrupted. The Kings fell all the way down to the 4th seed.</p>

<p>In the playoffs, they beat the Mavs 4-1 but three of those wins came by four points or less. Still though, Chris Webber was beginning to play better and the team was building up their chemistry once again.</p>

<p>The Kings went on to face the Minnesota Timberwolves in the next round. This was arguably the best Minnesota team during KG&rsquo;s tenure: he was elected MVP, Latrell Sprewell and Sam Cassel were experiencing a late career resurgence, and they had incredible depth at each position. Despite all this, the teams were evenly matched and Minnesota had a 3-2 lead going into game 6 at Sacramento. The Kings came out and completely dominated the Wolves, 104-87. The infamous Peeler elbow also occurred in this game and he was suspended for game 7 which the Kings lost after Chris Webber&rsquo;s attempt to tie rimmed out at the buzzer.</p>

<p>Now if you look at Peeler&rsquo;s numbers for those playoffs, they <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/peelean01/gamelog/2004/" target="_blank">aren&rsquo;t impressive</a>. His 3pt FG% dropped to 27% and he averaged 4.5 points per game. However, he was a key part of the bench rotation and while his shot wasn&rsquo;t falling, his defense was magnificent. He helped shut down Sam Cassell who <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/cassesa01/gamelog/2004/" target="_blank">torched the Nuggets</a> in the previous round. With Peeler suspended, the Kings had to rely on the likes of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/buforro01/gamelog/2004/#all_pgl_basic_playoffs" target="_blank">Rodney Buford</a>, who played a grand total of 22 games during the season and a whopping four minutes in the playoffs up to that point.</p>

<p>This was the last Kings team to ever seriously threaten for a championship. Vlade Divac left in free agency the following year and Chris Webber was traded shortly thereafter. It&rsquo;s unclear whether the Kings could have challenged the Lakers or even the Pistons that year, but they were beginning to click at the right time and had a team that could at least be in the conversation. All that fell apart when Anthony Peeler decided to throw his elbow at his best friend.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR Anthony Peeler&rsquo;s elbow ruined the last chance for the Sacramento Kings to win a championship.</strong></p>

But i am talking about him after the game in his press conference with him saying he not gonna just let him put his hands on him lol. When thats exactly what he did.

That’s what prompted the elbow to the face. Which is probably the smartest response once you know you’re under the guys skin.</p>

      <label for="lodbht8" class="commentText"><p>He did handle it though? You can quite literally see it in the video.</p>

<p>Instead of kicking off and risking suspension after the initial elbow, KG chose to aggressively bodyblock Peeler. He took an elbow to the face for his troubles but chose not to retaliate, because he knows that Peeler will be the one punished for the fracas. Watch him hop up and down after being hit in the face, you can see that he&rsquo;s ready to throw down in that moment but holds back instead because he knows Peeler is done for.</p>

<p>Then KG put up a big performance in game 7 and the timberwolves won the series.</p>

<p>Getting into a brawl so close to the deciding game would have been pointless. KG did the best thing here, bait out some macho man bullshit from Peeler and let the guy get himself suspended.</p>

<p>If you think battling is all about throwing hands <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>, then you have the wrong idea man. Knowing when to use mind games is way more important.</p>

I&rsquo;ve always felt that he would go over board or get too into the trash talk so to see this is actually satisfying. Talk shit get hit it&rsquo;s that simple. And KG didn&rsquo;t do shit neither, he got fucking punked, it&rsquo;s that simple. He was still recovering from that chest hit then ate one in the face and immediately backed off. That wasn&rsquo;t nothing to do with the game, he was In a losing fight and he knew it.</p>

<p>There’s a strong difference between someone who can back it up and chooses not to (and not get ejected) vs someone who acts tough but can’t back it up.</p>

<p>Eating a shot to the face like it’s nothing is not being a fake tough guy.</p>

<p>Also just slightly related, much to my wife’s chagrin, i have our small bin containing our apple peeler labeled “Anthony Peeler,” and my 12 year old and I refer to him as Anthony when he comes out.</p>

      <label for="lod8nhx" class="commentText"><p>This is what we call a double punking. KG gets the wind knocked out of him with a shot to the abdomen. Goes down like a chump. Gets up and tries to dish it out, unsuccessfully. And then gets chin checked for trying. Not a single motion to retaliate after the chin checking. Not even a hold me back hold me back movement. Just swallowed his pride and took his punking.</p>

      <label for="lod815q" class="commentText"><p>He got punked. Did he respond with a monster 4th quarter? Not at all, he was shook and couldn&rsquo;t recover that night. Reminds me of when Wade caught an elbow against New York in 2009 that made him bleed. Did he wait until the next game to respond? No, he took over that 4th quarter with 24 points including 15 during a 19-0 run in a comeback win cuz that&rsquo;s what real ones do.</p>
