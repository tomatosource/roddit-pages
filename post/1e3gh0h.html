      <label for="ld7qwpe" class="commentText"><p>KD and Steph. Both were at or close to their peaks. Steph 18 and KD 17 would’ve won most MVPs if they weren’t together. Both feature in most top 15 lists. The fit was also magical as both can function without the ball in Kerrs motion offense and KD gave them the edge they needed in clutch situations with his pure scoring ability</p>

<p>I can see a case for Magic and Kareem but Jabbar was past his very best years.</p>

      <label for="ld8gokk" class="commentText"><p>And Kareem was still MVP calibre for like 6 or 7 of the years they played together. He was insane. You were talking like 14 years after his statistical peak he was still an MVP level player. For LeBron that would be <sup>2025</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> if you are saying <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> was his peak. If you are calling it 09 it&rsquo;s <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> when Lebron was like the 8th or 9th best player. Both their age 38 seasons too.</p>

<p>Like people talk about moses dominating Kareem in like 81. Ignoring it&rsquo;s like years after his 3 year peak. For Jordan that would be <sup>99</sup>&frasl;<sub>2000</sub> he&rsquo;s retired, for steph that <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> most likely, Lebron it would be <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub>, for Shaq it would be 2010, for KD it would be <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>-<sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> (I think his 2 best seasons were 2014 and 2017 so it&rsquo;s hard to evaluate which one we should consider) for Kobe it would be like 2016. For bird it would be 91. Everyone else of that era was retiring 8 years after the end of their peak. Kareem had 5 more MVP level seasons after that.</p>

<p>Steph and KD were at their peaks. One of the greatest offensive talent showcase night in night out.</p>

<p>Magic and Kareem on the other hand was very much complimentary of each others playstyle that&rsquo;s why it feels like there was no weakness in that tandem, relative to the skills highlighted by that era of basketball.</p>

<p>Edit:<br>
Both won multiple chips but the Showtime Lakers&rsquo; sustained success throughout the 80s were heavily brought in by this duo. Surrounded by great complimentary pieces to built around these two&rsquo;s skillsets.</p>

You don’t have to question or worry about what KD can do without a good supporting cast because he’ll have a prime Steph right next to him.</p>

<p>Both incredible players, at the peak of their powers, and perfect fits together in that era of the nba game. You could freely argue that was the best guard/wing in the game and the best pf/c in the game. You could rank them #1 and #2 overall.</p>

KD/Steph and MJ/Pippen are close in my mind, but Pippen is top 30 and the other guys on this list are top 15, while KD/Steph were both perimeter oriented. There&rsquo;s something about having one dominant interior force and an equally dominant perimeter player that&rsquo;s just so pleasing to watch.</p>

<p>There’s pros and cons to these style changes. Yes Jordan would be great in transition in a faster-paced game (though I would note the game was already quite fast through most of his career in the 80s and early 90s), but he wouldn’t get the same one-on-one looks he did.</p>

<p>If we’re really doing cross-era comparisons, Steph doing Steph things would short-circuit brains in the 90s.</p>

      <label for="ld8urq7" class="commentText"><p>No offense but this kind of thing is baffling to say.</p>

<p>Luka doncic and demar derozan are remarkably great scorers in today&rsquo;s game. Both run iso heavy sets where they go one on one with their man and still get easy looks and buckets. Neither are even in the ballpark of speed and agility that Jordan had.</p>

<p>If iso heavy ball works for them, even when Luka is hobbled and going at 60% speed, what on earth makes you think Jordan would be less effective in a half court set? He was more than competent enough from 18+ feet to prevent defenders from just sagging on him and looking for help.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you look at his career highlights, Jordan went through, around, and over double teams all the damn time. Defenses are much more advanced today but guys who can drive with impunity and get into the lane still punish modern defenses and cause havoc with rotations.</p>

<p> That’s the entire reason defensive 3 seconds, which doesn’t exist in any other league, was brought in so those types of zones didn’t happen. Players and coaches truly believed bigs would just camp the paint in zone and cut off above the rim plays  but colangelo assured that won’t happen</p>

<p> But it’s worth noting that MJ already faced tons of zone defense and didn’t noticeably perform worse against them. </p>

      <label for="ld9fi7b" class="commentText"><p>Okay and DeRozan averaged 27ppg one season. He is decidedly worse at everything basketball related compared to MJ. MJ is faster, has better handles, better straight line quickness, lateral quickness, is echelons better on defense, has better perimeter moves, better post moves, is a better passer, is more consistent, stronger, more versatile on both sides of the ball, can jump much higher, has better body control.. The list is endless. If demar has multiple 24+ppg seasons in this era Jordan would have absolutely no issues skewering modern defenses. He would be an absolute terror to guard, there were 0 players in his day who could handle him, and I struggle to think of any in the modern nba who could stay in front of him except maybe prime Kawhi (obviously long gone).</p>

<p>In the fast paced era Jordan would post eye-watering stats even if he didn&rsquo;t develop a better 3 ball (which wasn&rsquo;t that terrible to begin with).</p>

      <label for="ld9hais" class="commentText"><p>There is an <em>enormous</em> gap between 27 PPG and 37 PPG, which is what MJ peaked at in his day. Even in the lowest scoring eras multiple guys were dropping 27 a game almost every year. Most eras there’s like half a dozen every year. Getting to 35 is extremely rarified air.</p>

<p>Of course he would be a terror to guard. In any era. Scoring <em>even more</em> than he already did though? No, that’s absurd. Faster pace these days means more potential transition shots, it does not usually mean more possessions - players play way fewer minutes now. MJ’s peak scoring season, he played 40 MPG. He’d be at ~37 now, if not less. He was also playing on by far the slowest-paced team in the league despite that era being reasonably fast, because playing slow was his game. That’s why the years following his retirement were slow as shit as every guard in the league tried to play like him. He could have played faster if he wanted to, and he chose to slow it down.</p>

      <label for="ld97b9s" class="commentText"><p>Jordan had defenders all around him either way cause of the terrible spacing and no defensive 3 seconds. The paint was way more crowded than it is today and thats where he did most of his damage. Plus, the Jordan rules was very much about abusing illegal defense rules and he killed whatever defense they put in front of him. If he could consistently beat double and triple teams than he wouldn&rsquo;t have any issues with zone, especially with all the spacing they have today. I think he has about the same scoring averages but probably 2-3 more assists per game with the added spacing and help defense cause he was a fantastic passer and playmaker too.</p>

Pippen might be the goat SF defender ever he did everything defensively at absurd levels , lovked up and caused issues for players pg/wing/bigs , deny bigs entry passes and nothing easy, rim protection from a wing like Lebron , on ball menace too . Pippen is probably the best defender ever at sf. And sf defence &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; guard . Jordan is not the goat guard defender or in that convo - Tony Allen , Gary Payton etc Jordan even after bulking up was still naturally  skinny and vulnerable to power players and gambled too much for steals. Still an all time defensive duo but it just slightly irks me to
Lead with Jordan dpoy cos of media dummies voting in awards over the fact pippen was insane on defencd even compared to Jordan who was great there.</p>

      <label for="ld8bg4p" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m always telling people that the Wade Lebron played with in Miami was a past prime Wade. He was 28 at the start of their first season but turned 29 that January anyways he had some injuries to his legs that took away some of his explosiveness. I mean he was nicknamed &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; so him losing a little bit off the top doesn&rsquo;t look crazy because he was so good but just that Comparatively Lebron never played with the best version of Wade.</p>

<p>My point? I got to rewatch some 08 Olympics.</p>

<p>The subsequent 08/09 season was his best ever from an individual standpoint. 30/7/5, made all-nba 1st team. Flash was back.</p>

<p>LeBron and Wade on the 2008 Olympics team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say that they were the most dynamic players on that 2008 team, but I&rsquo;m not sure that either was even the best player on that team [depending on the definition of best]</p>

<p>Wade was on a mission on that team, and actually has my vote for most dynamic player, even if he came off the bench. LeBron did it all around, offense and defense.</p>

<p>But Kobe frickin Bryant set the tone on defense early on, and was the person they turned to when the going got tight [See dying minutes of redeem team vs Spain]. At that age, he was not still the force he was before, but he had the aura of the Finals and the rings, and he has the smoothness and poise.</p>

<p>What the heatles gave them was a degree of intimidation, and then the year after the post Dirk ring, confidence and poise in having won it all, even if Wade slipped a significant bit by then.</p>

<p>IMHO that mental edge should be considered. At the highest level a degree of mental edge outweighs a degree of the physical play on court.</p>

<p>I’m sorry I know we’re lakers fans but Kobe was not the best player he might’ve been treated like it and took the most shots but Wade n Lebron we’re better in every area - they averaged more on way higher efficiency and less shot attemots , more assists , more rebound’s especially offensive rebounds , more steals , and more blocks Lebron . Kobe just took the mist shots. By 2008 Kobe was not the same guy defensively he was at his peak defence during the end of the three peat time, Kobe might’ve been the older experienced player that players admired but if he was the best player he didn’t play like it . Yes his team mates respected him n we know those stories but his production wasn’t there</p>

<p>Lebron and wades numbers look inhuman . Absurd efficiency, absurd offensive rebounding from Wade , absurd steals and from Lebron great block numbers too. They absolutely cooked. It’s kinda sad Wade got injured constsntky and was never the same guy he was once.</p>

<p>Not saying Pippen was better than all the other Robins here. Just pointing out that it is very hard to compare production across eras because play has changed so much. Teams used to beat the shit out of MJ and he would still hang 38 on them. I cannot fathom what he would have been capable of in the &ldquo;freedom of movement&rdquo; era.</p>

I mean, Pippen looks pretty productive and skillful on the defensive side. But maybe casuals just like dunks and 3s</p>

      <label for="ld7tqkc" class="commentText"><p>its funny you say this cuz as often as i visit basketball subs / forums / etc. you almost NEVER see anyone post anything about Pippen (high light vids, stats, etc.) His name comes up, but its always just like shadow of jordan / underrated shit. Born in the 80s i grew up a Jordan fan like most basketball heads growing up in the 90s and i know Pippen was fuckin great yet i still have almost no memories of why i know he was great. I want to start seeing people posting Pippen videos.</p>

If we’re comparing MJ and Pippen to duos like Shaq and Kobe, Steph and KD, or even Bron and Wade, Pippen is by far the worst player out of all of them.</p>

      <label for="ld8is3y" class="commentText"><p>Pippen dedicated his game to be an all-around players with an extra emphasis on defense.  Part of the reason was because MJ was so dominant offensively.  This is one of the top reasons why the Bulls dynasty produced 6 championships.</p>

<p>The other guys you listed couldn&rsquo;t come close to Pippen on the defensive sides, while their offensive production might be greater, they don&rsquo;t have nearly the impact on winning championships as MJ and Pippen.  I&rsquo;d say Shaq and Kobe come closest, the Lakers were unstoppable early on when Kobe played second fiddle, once that stopped that duo didn&rsquo;t last very long.  I&rsquo;ve always felt had Kobe pulled back his game a little and let prime Shaq dominated more, the Lakers would have came much closer to the Bulls dynasty.  But it takes a lot for a true super star to sacrifice their game for the good of the team.</p>

At his very best Pippen grades out around Jayson Tatum and I’d even strongly lean toward Tatum being better considering how versatile his defense is, and how much better his scoring is relative to the league average of the time.</p>

      <label for="ld8q7pj" class="commentText"><p>In terms of MVP level, I would point out again that he got overshadowed by MJ throughout his career.  The year that MJ played baseball, Pippen did win the all-star MVP (for whatever it&rsquo;s worth), and that year he demonstrated he had the ability to score at a very high level, and nearly took his team to the NBA Finals without a true all-star duo.</p>

<p>I may be biased, but I don&rsquo;t think Jayson&rsquo;s defense ability comes close to Pippen&rsquo;s in his prime.</p>

<p>Pippen also shot over 50% the next year going 21 a game WITH prime Jordan. He could have easily put up Kobe numbers on better efficiency if his FT% was at 80.</p>

      <label for="ld9tbm7" class="commentText"><p>Adjusted for league efficiency, Kobe has a better TS than Pippen while being a much higher-volume scorer. Per 100 possessions, he scores 50% more volume on better efficiency. Kobe was also not a slouch defensively, especially in his younger years. Looking at stats, Pippen is way closer to Pascal Siakam (actually he scores less) with better defense than true MVP level players like Kobe, Bron, Jordan, etc.</p>

He was a worse FT shooter, but still if Pippen were to lead a team that year he most definitely would have been in the MVP race. He was damn good, and this was when his defense was kinda not appreciated by many.</p>

<p>People forget Kobe never shot more 46% from the field. He wasn&rsquo;t exactly among the best shooters in the game. Neither was Pippen overall, but for a couple years he definitely was.</p>

He could definitely hang with Kobe lol. Kobe had a generation whistle and was also better at FT shooting.</p>

EVERYTHING MJ ever did was only after he got Scottie Pippen. When you say 2-3peats you say Scottie f$&amp;@“ Pippen. As an individual he may not be top 10, as a duo he is one half of the greatest nba duo ever.  Put some respect on his name.</p>

Had Steph and Klay(also there’s not enough mention of those two in the years before Klay got hurt but I digress)hit their stride AND were given a coach who embraced their style of play at the same time, we may have different convos about those two cause you gotta think, that OKC team took the Warriors to 7 games in the WCF. And damn near won had been for one mistake by Westbrook in the final seconds of game 6 I wanna say. They could’ve won that series and went back to the finals and would’ve had a good chance to beat that Cavs team even with Lebron(speaking of which I’m not seeing enough Lebron and Kyrie mentions either but again I digress). In fact with all their injuries I say they probably could’ve beaten that team just as easily as the Warriors did.</p>

<p>Heck, that same year, Elgin averaged 38.3 and West 30.8 for 69.1 ppg for Lakers.</p>

<p>Rockets Harden (34.3) and WB (27.2) are among the also rans</p>

<blockquote>
<p>12–1 mark after league and NBA Finals MVP Moses promised &ldquo;Fo&rsquo;, fo&rsquo;, fo&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;four, four, four&rdquo;—four wins to win round 1, four wins to win round 2, etc.), but it actually wound up as &ldquo;Fo&rsquo;, fi&rsquo;, fo.&rdquo; (four, five, four).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2001 lakers by contrast went 15-1 and were unbeaten until a brilliant AI performance barely pushed philadelphia past AI in overtime.</p>

<p>Given that the only lakers loss was in overtime, and they preserved their unbeaten run longer, <em>and</em> were dominating, I&rsquo;m picking 2001 Shaqobe Lakers over Malone/Dr J fo&rsquo; fi fo&rsquo; &lsquo;6ers</p>

<p>You could also make an argument for 2017 GSW, who went 16-1, had an unbroken 15 game playoff win streak broken in game 4 of the finals.</p>

<p>KD/Steph were great too, but they also had an AllStar team around them that made everything fit. I think if you just put those 2 on a team full of role players like those Lakers, they’d still be great but no one would consider them unbeatable like those Lakers were especially in 01</p>

<p>With Shaq I don’t even have to explain. You just weren’t doing anything with him. He’s widely considered the greatest peak player ever for a reason</p>

<p>With Kobe you have a fearless and unstoppable 2-way guard who wants to be like MJ and never backs down. He’ll drop 50 on you in a heartbeat from anywhere on the floor, then hit clutch shot after clutch shot</p>

<p>Has there ever been a situation where 2 of the 3 beat players in the league were on the same team at the same time? Jordan and Pippin weren&rsquo;t, none of LeBrons teammates were&hellip; LeBron and Wade in 2011-2013 MAYBE, but I don&rsquo;t think Wade was consistently top 3 in the league&hellip; Steph and KD are close, but that was 2 years to Shaq/Kobe&rsquo;s 4.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s even really a close debate.</p>

      <label for="ld9cu5p" class="commentText"><p>If we’re talking single year peaks then 2020 Bron and AD have to be up there. Both All-NBA 1st team. They were the two best players in the playoffs that year.</p>

<p>28-10-4 on 57/38/83 splits (67 TS%) and GOAT-tier defense from AD</p>

<p>28-11-9 on 56/37/72 splits (65 TS%) and All-D tier defense from Bron</p>

<p>And their stats are actually hurt by how easily they won. They just didn’t rack up normal playoff minutes.</p>

<p>You basically won’t find a single stat that won’t have them ranked as no1 and no2 in the playoffs in one order or the other.</p>

<p>The Lakers were +13.97 net rating in the playoffs with both on the floor. They were -45.62 with both on the bench.</p>

<p>That +14 together is on par with the +15.3 of Kobe/Shaq in ‘01, and not that far off the +17.4 of KD/Steph in ‘17, but the ‘20 Lakers were waaaay worse without their stars on the court than both of those teams.</p>

<p>Also one of the rare instances in NBA history where a team won a championship with their 2 best offensive players being the same as their two best defensive players.</p>

      <label for="ld9wcwo" class="commentText"><p>Shaq MIGHT bring that team out, but Kobe is slightly overrated. Never shot over 46% with a generational whistle. Over 13FTA a game two times in his career. Jordan had that 3 times but all in the 80s and never again.</p>

<p>Pippen on the other hand IN HIS PRIME is underrated. In 90-91 he shot 52% from the field for around 18 a game. 21 a game next season and still over 50%. Slightly worse FT shooter than Kobe but a better defender.</p>

<p>So it comes down to can any of these fools shoot a three lol? They were all kinda in the same atmosphere with 3s outside of Shaq lol. Can they even stop Shaq? Hard to say right? If anything Shaq might need a duo with a center to properly play 2 mans. Magic and Kareem would easily compete with Shaq and Kobe.</p>

<p>We might need to bring Bill Cartwright out with Jordan lmao.</p>

<p>Unfortunately AD n Lebron seasons were destroyed by injuries if they stay healthy and repeat as they should we’d look at them better. Imo 2020 AD with Lebron is better then any Wade Bron pairing was to me .</p>

<p>But it’s gotta be shaq n Kobe , kd n Steph are decent but not same lvl . They had Klay Dray n iggy too-</p>

      <label for="ld7y3y4" class="commentText"><p>You can order them however you want but these are the only 3 choices</p>

<ul>
<li>MJ / Pippen</li>
<li>Magic / Kareem</li>
<li>Shaq / Kobe</li>
</ul>

<p>I would go with Shaq and Kobe personally because I believe Kobe was better than Pippen and I think those 3 years of Shaq were the best 3 years of any player in the history of the game. I don&rsquo;t even think MJ was that unbeatable, where MJ had a really good roster with depth, all Shaq needed was a young Kobe.</p>

<p>To the kids who didn&rsquo;t want Shaq those 3 years, the league literally lifted the zone defense ban because of how unstoppable he was. It was the most silly thing you can witness on the court.</p>

      <label for="ld9vyir" class="commentText"><p>Kobe had a generational whistle and shot 46% or less his entire career. Quite honestly, when guarded, he isn&rsquo;t as good as prime Pippen was. Kobe had more than 13FTA a game in his career twice. Jordan had that only in the 80s and never again.</p>

<p>Pippen was straight up a better defender. Not saying Kobe and Shaq is not up there, they are because of Shaq, but Kobe isn&rsquo;t like the best there ever was lol. He&rsquo;s honestly slightly overrated without all the free throws.</p>
