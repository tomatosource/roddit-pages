      <label for="ld7qwpe" class="commentText"><p>KD and Steph. Both were at or close to their peaks. Steph 18 and KD 17 would’ve won most MVPs if they weren’t together. Both feature in most top 15 lists. The fit was also magical as both can function without the ball in Kerrs motion offense and KD gave them the edge they needed in clutch situations with his pure scoring ability</p>

<p>I can see a case for Magic and Kareem but Jabbar was past his very best years.</p>

      <label for="ld8gokk" class="commentText"><p>And Kareem was still MVP calibre for like 6 or 7 of the years they played together. He was insane. You were talking like 14 years after his statistical peak he was still an MVP level player. For LeBron that would be <sup>2025</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> if you are saying <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> was his peak. If you are calling it 09 it&rsquo;s <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> when Lebron was like the 8th or 9th best player. Both their age 38 seasons too.</p>

<p>Like people talk about moses dominating Kareem in like 81. Ignoring it&rsquo;s like years after his 3 year peak. For Jordan that would be <sup>99</sup>&frasl;<sub>2000</sub> he&rsquo;s retired, for steph that <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> most likely, Lebron it would be <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub>, for Shaq it would be 2010, for KD it would be <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>-<sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> (I think his 2 best seasons were 2014 and 2017 so it&rsquo;s hard to evaluate which one we should consider) for Kobe it would be like 2016. For bird it would be 91. Everyone else of that era was retiring 8 years after the end of their peak. Kareem had 5 more MVP level seasons after that.</p>

You don’t have to question or worry about what KD can do without a good supporting cast because he’ll have a prime Steph right next to him.</p>

<p>Both incredible players, at the peak of their powers, and perfect fits together in that era of the nba game. You could freely argue that was the best guard/wing in the game and the best pf/c in the game. You could rank them #1 and #2 overall.</p>

KD/Steph and MJ/Pippen are close in my mind, but Pippen is top 30 and the other guys on this list are top 15, while KD/Steph were both perimeter oriented. There&rsquo;s something about having one dominant interior force and an equally dominant perimeter player that&rsquo;s just so pleasing to watch.</p>

<p>The best 4 players we&rsquo;ve ever had on one non-Olympic team? KD/Steph/Klay/Dray, for sure.</p>

<p>But god damn I wish I could’ve appreciated it more back then. I’m so glad I got to witness Shaq. Just absolutely unstoppable.</p>

<p>Everyone talks about stars and how the 3 ball would change things but in today&rsquo;s open court fast offense Jordan&rsquo;s absolutely insane speed and agility would blow minds. He was 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; and would make defenses cry today.</p>

      <label for="ld8nq5z" class="commentText"><p>Meanwhile in the half court, Jordan loved an iso and that was a whole lot easier when a lack of zone defences meant his team could clear an entire defence out just by standing on the other side of the court.</p>

<p>There’s pros and cons to these style changes. Yes Jordan would be great in transition in a faster-paced game (though I would note the game was already quite fast through most of his career in the 80s and early 90s), but he wouldn’t get the same one-on-one looks he did.</p>

<p>If we’re really doing cross-era comparisons, Steph doing Steph things would short-circuit brains in the 90s.</p>

      <label for="ld8urq7" class="commentText"><p>No offense but this kind of thing is baffling to say.</p>

<p>Luka doncic and demar derozan are remarkably great scorers in today&rsquo;s game. Both run iso heavy sets where they go one on one with their man and still get easy looks and buckets. Neither are even in the ballpark of speed and agility that Jordan had.</p>

<p>If iso heavy ball works for them, even when Luka is hobbled and going at 60% speed, what on earth makes you think Jordan would be less effective in a half court set? He was more than competent enough from 18+ feet to prevent defenders from just sagging on him and looking for help.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you look at his career highlights, Jordan went through, around, and over double teams all the damn time. Defenses are much more advanced today but guys who can drive with impunity and get into the lane still punish modern defenses and cause havoc with rotations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2001/04/01/if-zone-defenses-come-in-stars-may-go-out/" target="_blank">Jordan himself knew it.</a> Zones don’t mean he’d be a bad scorer by any stretch, but they are clearly bad for somebody who likes to iso and rarely shoots past 20 feet, especially off the dribble.</p>

      <label for="ld8xi9f" class="commentText"><p>That quote was referring to unrestricted zones, which still aren’t allowed</p>

<p> That’s the entire reason defensive 3 seconds, which doesn’t exist in any other league, was brought in so those types of zones didn’t happen. Players and coaches truly believed bigs would just camp the paint in zone and cut off above the rim plays  but colangelo assured that won’t happen</p>

<p> But it’s worth noting that MJ already faced tons of zone defense and didn’t noticeably perform worse against them. </p>

He was 28 at the start of their first season but turned 29 that January anyways he had some injuries to his legs that took away some of his explosiveness. I mean he was nicknamed &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; so him losing a little bit off the top doesn&rsquo;t look crazy because he was so good but just that Comparatively Lebron never played with the best version of Wade.</p>

<p>My point? I got to rewatch some 08 Olympics.</p>

<p>Not saying Pippen was better than all the other Robins here. Just pointing out that it is very hard to compare production across eras because play has changed so much. Teams used to beat the shit out of MJ and he would still hang 38 on them. I cannot fathom what he would have been capable of in the &ldquo;freedom of movement&rdquo; era.</p>

Born in the 80s i grew up a Jordan fan like most basketball heads growing up in the 90s and i know Pippen was fuckin great yet i still have almost no memories of why i know he was great. I want to start seeing people posting Pippen videos.</p>

      <label for="ld892jz" class="commentText"><p>Is he? Pippen is great but his offense was never remotely close to the other guys we’re talking about. If we’re comparing MJ and Pippen to duos like Shaq and Kobe, Steph and KD, or even Bron and Wade, Pippen is by far the worst player out of all of them.</p>

      <label for="ld8is3y" class="commentText"><p>Pippen dedicated his game to be an all-around players with an extra emphasis on defense.  Part of the reason was because MJ was so dominant offensively.  This is one of the top reasons why the Bulls dynasty produced 6 championships.</p>

<p>The other guys you listed couldn&rsquo;t come close to Pippen on the defensive sides, while their offensive production might be greater, they don&rsquo;t have nearly the impact on winning championships as MJ and Pippen.  I&rsquo;d say Shaq and Kobe come closest, the Lakers were unstoppable early on when Kobe played second fiddle, once that stopped that duo didn&rsquo;t last very long.  I&rsquo;ve always felt had Kobe pulled back his game a little and let prime Shaq dominated more, the Lakers would have came much closer to the Bulls dynasty.  But it takes a lot for a true super star to sacrifice their game for the good of the team.</p>

      <label for="ld8p7kr" class="commentText"><p>Like I said, Pippen is great, but even considering defense I don’t think he’s at the MVP level like KD, Kobe, Lebron, MJ, etc. were for their entire primes. At his very best Pippen grades out around Jayson Tatum and I’d even strongly lean toward Tatum being better considering how versatile his defense is, and how much better his scoring is relative to the league average of the time.</p>

      <label for="ld8q7pj" class="commentText"><p>In terms of MVP level, I would point out again that he got overshadowed by MJ throughout his career.  The year that MJ played baseball, Pippen did win the all-star MVP (for whatever it&rsquo;s worth), and that year he demonstrated he had the ability to score at a very high level, and nearly took his team to the NBA Finals without a true all-star duo.</p>

<p>I may be biased, but I don&rsquo;t think Jayson&rsquo;s defense ability comes close to Pippen&rsquo;s in his prime.</p>

      <label for="ld8j8qs" class="commentText"><p>I’m not seeing enough love for KD and West took after Harden left. Had Steph and Klay(also there’s not enough mention of those two in the years before Klay got hurt but I digress)hit their stride AND were given a coach who embraced their style of play at the same time, we may have different convos about those two cause you gotta think, that OKC team took the Warriors to 7 games in the WCF. And damn near won had been for one mistake by Westbrook in the final seconds of game 6 I wanna say. They could’ve won that series and went back to the finals and would’ve had a good chance to beat that Cavs team even with Lebron(speaking of which I’m not seeing enough Lebron and Kyrie mentions either but again I digress). In fact with all their injuries I say they probably could’ve beaten that team just as easily as the Warriors did.</p>

<p>KD/Steph were great too, but they also had an AllStar team around them that made everything fit. I think if you just put those 2 on a team full of role players like those Lakers, they’d still be great but no one would consider them unbeatable like those Lakers were especially in 01</p>

<p>With Shaq I don’t even have to explain. You just weren’t doing anything with him. He’s widely considered the greatest peak player ever for a reason</p>

<p>With Kobe you have a fearless and unstoppable 2-way guard who wants to be like MJ and never backs down. He’ll drop 50 on you in a heartbeat from anywhere on the floor, then hit clutch shot after clutch shot</p>

<p>Has there ever been a situation where 2 of the 3 beat players in the league were on the same team at the same time? Jordan and Pippin weren&rsquo;t, none of LeBrons teammates were&hellip; LeBron and Wade in 2011-2013 MAYBE, but I don&rsquo;t think Wade was consistently top 3 in the league&hellip; Steph and KD are close, but that was 2 years to Shaq/Kobe&rsquo;s 4.</p>

      <label for="ld8abtk" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure how you want to factor in defense, but if you do, I think Bron &amp; AD&rsquo;s 2020 run deserves an honorable mention of some sort. They were a better offensive fit than Bron &amp; Wade and a historically versatile defensive duo</p>

      <label for="ld7y3y4" class="commentText"><p>You can order them however you want but these are the only 3 choices</p>

<ul>
<li>MJ / Pippen</li>
<li>Magic / Kareem</li>
<li>Shaq / Kobe</li>
</ul>

<p>I would go with Shaq and Kobe personally because I believe Kobe was better than Pippen and I think those 3 years of Shaq were the best 3 years of any player in the history of the game. I don&rsquo;t even think MJ was that unbeatable, where MJ had a really good roster with depth, all Shaq needed was a young Kobe.</p>

<p>To the kids who didn&rsquo;t want Shaq those 3 years, the league literally lifted the zone defense ban because of how unstoppable he was. It was the most silly thing you can witness on the court.</p>
