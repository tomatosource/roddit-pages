<p>It is now almost August.</p>

<p>League sources say that the Bulls are thus resigned to fact that they will likely be forced to start the new season with LaVine on the roster and take it a step further by trying to help him rebuild some trade value after months of fruitless efforts to find a new home via trade — and after a foot injury and eventual surgery limited the 29-year-old to 25 games last season.</p>

      <label for="lf2i023" class="commentText"><p>I think finding a mid-season trade is going to be extremely difficult.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s very few &ldquo;deadweight&rdquo; big NBA contracts coming into the season to even find a way to match LaVine&rsquo;s salary without giving up too many players.</p>

<p>You figure the Nets are thrilled to be almost off Simmons&rsquo; money, the Suns would probably rather have Beal than LaVine, and I don&rsquo;t see the Wizards jumping at a chance to turn Poole into LaVine. The Heat or Toronto could put the salaries together, but they&rsquo;d have to give up guys that have real value to do so.</p>

      <label for="lf2jm67" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, they can get there without giving up critical pieces, you figure they also think that Bruce has maybe real value and Agbaji is a decent lottery ticket guy, so I sorta think they would feel like they&rsquo;re giving up <em>more</em> value than they&rsquo;re receiving in that instance.</p>

<p>Also adding LaVine after their long-term commitments to Barnes/Quickley/Barrett would be extremely expensive.</p>

<p>For all of Giddey&rsquo;s faults, I think I&rsquo;d rather have him as a return instead of a couple of picks outside of the lottery.</p>

<p>There is an argument to be made that Chicago should have gotten some sort of draft compensation from OKC, but Caruso was an expiring and it also took Giddey shitting the bed in this year&rsquo;s playoffs for him to be available.</p>

      <label for="lf2lk86" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I thought it was a pretty great trade for both sides. I love Caruso as a player and it&rsquo;s a great trade for OKC obviously with their roster, and putting elite role players around top end talent is exactly what they should be doing, but getting Giddey as a rebuilder for an (elite) role player with 1 year left is a clear win imo.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the DeRozan trade I can&rsquo;t make sense of lol</p>

      <label for="lf2lzde" class="commentText"><p>The past few contracts that DeMar has gotten have surprised me because I&rsquo;ve always figured that his skillset just wouldn&rsquo;t translate to a bag.</p>

<p>Yeah the Kings fit is weird, but they obviously wanted an upgrade at the 4 from Harrison Barnes and he was significantly cheaper than say, Brandon Ingram.</p>

      <label for="lf2is7w" class="commentText"><p>More assets in return. Especially so Caruso. Although they actively chose Giddey. But their stocks are higher and asset value is higher than it was in the offseason. They&rsquo;d be in a better spot, but still not an amazing spot. It really does boil down to lottery luck for the Bulls this year to determine their positioning.</p>

      <label for="lf2igjf" class="commentText"><p>Zach is a fantastic scorer when healthy. He&rsquo;s also not old. He&rsquo;s someone this team can still build around as an experienced scorer around their young core&hellip;they don&rsquo;t really have a first option guy&hellip;.Zach can be that. He can help take load off Coby and whoever they pick in 2025 with their pick, that hopefully for them conveys. I&rsquo;m gonna guess it conveys. Matas isn&rsquo;t a first option guy either. It&rsquo;s actually a positive for Coby and Giddey in particular to play with someone who commands the attention Zach does.</p>

<p>Zach has done well in similar circumstances before and has a lot to prove. The bigger issue is gonna be his relationship with Donovan.</p>

      <label for="lf2jjvw" class="commentText"><p>Add it to the list. Also, I said we should’ve drafted Filipowski/Ware and already it looks like we should’ve drafted Filipowski/Ware — who could’ve been had for not that much. Could’ve taken Ware at 11 and bought a second round pick and we’d have our front court set for the next decade but that would’ve taken creativity from the worst front office in the NBA.</p>

<p>You guys crapped on/crap on GarPax all the time, well now we have literally a bottom 3 front office. We’re right up there with the Pistons and Wizards. Karnisovas is incapable of, as I’ve said, any sort of creativity, winning any trade, making a good signing, having any sort of foresight, giving out a good contract, managing his assets, drafting well, coming up with a plan of how players should fit together. He literally sucks at every facet of the job.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gave away Daniel Gafford.</li>
<li>Gave away Lauri Markannen.</li>
<li>Gave a max contract to a one dimensional, volume scorer.</li>
<li>Gave up a better trade package for an aging, one dimensional, fringe All-Star than real superstar players get you in the market, who was available for good reason.</li>
<li>⁠Drafted Patrick Williams (and I love and believe in Patrick Williams) when there were better players on the board.</li>
<li>Signed an aging, one dimensional midrange shooter in a post-midrange NBA, who was available for good reason.</li>
<li>Signed a damaged goods PG, who was available for good reason.</li>
<li>Traded Caruso to a team that has 71418482517 picks and couldn’t even get one of them, acquiring a player who is at the lowest perceived value he could be.</li>
<li>Traded DeRozan and let a team that didn’t even give up anything get the most valuable asset in the deal.</li>
<li>Drafted Buzelis and already it looks like there were 100+ better things we could’ve done with the pick.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s look at Karnisovas’ supposed wins:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signed Caruso. Every year a glue guy from a championship team gets paid. Wash.</li>
<li>⁠Drafted Ayo. You guys overrate Ayo. Ayo’s trajectory is like an okay rotation player, if that. Besides, hometown kid and everyone was demanding we draft him. Wash.</li>
<li>⁠Signed Coby to a good deal. I’m sorry but looking at his body of work, I don’t believe Karnisovas did that. More likely, he fell backwards into something positive happening.</li>
</ul>

<p>You guys (fellow Bulls fans) all pooped on GarPax but GarPax were never this incompetent.</p>

      <label for="lf2m2mp" class="commentText"><p>Good. Makes no sense to trade him just to trade him. He hasn’t been a locker room issue in the slightest and has good rapport with the existing players. Finding him an actual playmaker in Giddey will also help his game.</p>
