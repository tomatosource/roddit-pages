<blockquote>
<p><em>I asked Adam Silver if he&rsquo;s at all concerned that the &ldquo;second apron&rdquo; and increased complexities of the CBA are leaving average fans confused. His response:</em></p>

<p>ADAM SILVER: &ldquo;I would say certainly yes, always try to find that balance that we want a system both that substantively serves its goals in terms of putting every team in a position to compete, but at the same time you&rsquo;re right, we want it to be understandable to fans, and to the media for that matter as well, and to our broadcasters as they&rsquo;re explaining it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, it&rsquo;s early days in this deal. This whole notion of a second apron, unfortunately by definition it gets fairly complicated. Sometimes simple rules — while we&rsquo;d all like to deal with that, the nuances, life is complicated and the systems become inherently more complicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re paying a lot of attention to it and we&rsquo;ll see. I think in the first instance, there&rsquo;s still a learning curve for our teams, as I was saying earlier. Not that our teams didn&rsquo;t understand it, but when you see it in actual operation, see how it&rsquo;s affecting general managers and their ability to move certain players, then it really begins to sink in.&rdquo;</p>

<li><p>It does, it has many. For example, if teams make substantive losses, or league revenues crash, the teams can reneg on the CBA. It was floated when COVID hit, but the players and teams agreed to a compromise.</p></li>

<li><p>Why would it have a take-back clause if &ldquo;fans don&rsquo;t understand it&rdquo;? The CBA process is long and tedious, and the point is to give stability to owner-player relations. The CBA rules were instituted so owners and players could both get what they consider a fair deal. If they undo the second tax apron they still need to come up with a new agreement that fulfills the desires of both the players and the teams.</p></li>

The difference between a super max and a regular max shouldn’t count against the cap.

      <label for="ldmve3l" class="commentText"><p>Such a rule will mostly help super teams.</p>

<p>They want the NBA to be more competitive as a whole. They don’t want teams with 3+ superstars and having supermax count as max does exactly that.</p>

<p>The supermax is doing what it was supposed to do. Stars are not leaving in FA anymore.</p>

<p>Besides, if they make such a rule, every home grown max player will ask for that supermax and then they feel offended if not offered that.</p>

<p>I think you will have a hard time convincing half of the league to agree to such a term when it would mostly help top teams</p>

<p>You should still be able to build around even 2 home grown superstars getting supermax.</p>

<p>I would sympathize with a team if they have 3 generational home grown talents (talking superstars, top 10 in the league level players), but that rarely happens, and even if it does, that team would be fine trading one of those for depth/future assets.</p>

The entire NBA solar system had to align for that to happen.</p>

      <label for="ldnj00m" class="commentText"><p>Well yeah, that’s a good thing. It doesn’t always work out that way though, OKC traded Harden, GSW almost traded Monta. Danny Ainge almost traded one of the Jays. It’s also not like every team that drafts in the lottery gets a generational guy either. Would you rather see more of the Suns and Clipper type of teams or more of the Celtics, Denver, type of teams.</p>

<p>If you look at great teams throughout 2000-2024 how many of them would have been effected by this outside of the cap spike KD warriors? The hard part should be drafting the stars not building around them. With the new CBA it’s harder than it’s ever been to build a competitive team around guys you draft.</p>

<p>Players would still leave for better cities, no. 2s would still try to be no. 1s elsewhere. Beef between players would still happen.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t have teams like the warriors where curry is still great but they don’t have the financial ability to build around him, or Denver losing KCP, or Boston in 3 years having to get rid of everyone except White Brown and Tatum</p>

<p>Most of the “major restrictions” have been more about owners having an excuse to be cheap, and less about actual cap ramifications. The Clippers could have given Paul George the exact same 4-year contract that the 76ers offered him. The Nuggets could have paid KCP the same amount he got from the Magic. On the other end, the Celtics proved you can still pay everyone huge contract if you want.</p>

      <label for="ldmabv3" class="commentText"><p>You misread or misremembered it. I believe the headline you&rsquo;re referring to is that no player got the full MLE and a multi-year deal.</p>

<p>The Warriors gave Melton the entire MLE, but only on a 1 year deal.</p>

<p>As of this post, 3 teams have used most of their MLE on a signing (Bulls, Clippers, Mavs).</p>

<p>The Sixers also gave Kelly Oubre a 2-year deal with their entire MLE. But since the Sixers were a cap space team, their MLE is technically called the &ldquo;room exception&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s smaller than the full MLE.</p>

<p>The Rockets and the Clippers also used their bi-annual exception on a player. Aaron Holiday for the Rockets and Nicolas Batum for the Clippers. This isn&rsquo;t the MLE, but it is free money that most teams could use if they wanted to.</p>

The salary floor changes, the extra two-way player slot, the second round exception, and the larger year-over-year raises on extensions are just some examples of tangible wins for the players&rsquo; bottom line.</p>

<p>The Rockets would not have dumped <span class="math inline">\(40 million onto Fred VanVleet's lap, and the same can be said about the Pistons dumping \)</span>26 million onto Tobias Harris, if it were not for the salary floor changes. The fact that their deals were structured to be short-term so that there are no long-term cap implications just shows that teams are dumping huge amounts of money on players just because they have to.</p>

<p>2nd Apron: 188.9</p>

<p>Even before the existence of apron restrictions only a few teams would go more than 7 million over the tax. Even fewer would go 18 million over the tax.  The aprons are just cover for a majority of owners to use as a scapegoat for money they probably weren&rsquo;t going to spend anyways.</p>

<p>If team payrolls fall short of 51% of BRI, the player&rsquo;s association receives the shortfall to distribute as it sees fit, and, if team payrolls exceed 51% of BRI, a percentage of their salaries is withheld.</p>

<p>The only major change I would make is that the difference between a Super Max and a regular Max shouldn’t affect the salary cap. Just pay it to the players, but don’t count it towards the team salary. It’s stupid that teams are technically incentivized to have their players <em>not</em> make an All-NBA team.</p>

      <label for="ldmrjfs" class="commentText"><p>Yep exactly, I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of that idea. I&rsquo;d take it further though.. The salary difference between a max/supermax doesn&rsquo;t count against the cap for the team that gave the supermax, however, if you force your way out and ask for a trade, you forfeit the additional supermax money to go down to a regular max, and the trading team takes an additional cap hit or something.</p>

<p>They need to figure out a way to disincentivize all the player empowerment. On one hand it&rsquo;s good for the players, but it&rsquo;s also bad for the sport IMO. You signed a fucking contract, you don&rsquo;t get to force your way out without repercussions. Can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>That same logic applies to teams, though, who are generally able to ship players off without repercussion. What you&rsquo;d probably see as a consequence is more players negotiating for no-trade clauses or trade kickers. And players who want out will push for that &ldquo;unofficially&rdquo; to avoid the hit from forcing their way out.</p>

<p>All of this will mean less movement, which may be good for the point, but some of the same pundits (<em>cough</em> Bill Simmons) calling for these changes will almost certainly then complain that the trade deadline is boring.</p>

<p>I think this would be a good direction to move in, to be clear, we just gotta be aware of the secondary effects.</p>

      <label for="ldn6hm8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I get that. My problem is mostly with these players sticking around to grab the supermax bag from the team that drafts them and then trying to force their way to a new team and keep their money. Part of the reason is that there is no real middle ground. Every up and coming young player thinks they&rsquo;re worth a max, when that&rsquo;s just not true. Realistically, there are probably like 5-10 guys in the league that are actually worth a supermax. Then maybe another 10 guys that are worth regular maxes. The problem is teams don&rsquo;t really have a choice. You either have to max your good young talent even if they aren&rsquo;t actually worth it, or else you risk some other team doing it.</p>

<p>I think the 2nd apron is making teams a bit more wary about giving out those contracts now though, and we&rsquo;re seeing that a bit with guys like Ingram.</p>

      <label for="ldn7rn4" class="commentText"><p>I think the idea that teams don&rsquo;t have a choice here is overplayed, honestly. If you don&rsquo;t give a guy a supermax that isn&rsquo;t worth it, and another team does, that other team has hamstrung themselves with a bad contract. Teams are just so concerned with losing the asset they don&rsquo;t want to do that, but you look at the Hornets declining to max Kemba versus the Bulls maxing Lavine and there are plenty of situations where not giving a guy the contract is the right call.</p>

<p>I do totally agree on the players forcing their way out part, though. I agree that players who demand trades should get adjusted down.</p>

But one of the things I don&rsquo;t like about the NFL&rsquo;s hard cap is that the best teams often come down over-performing rookies getting underpaid. A team like the Wolves would be broken up after last year because Ant and McDaniels are getting massive salary increases. The Celtics would be long gone by now.</p>

<p>But the apron is good for the league too. As much as I&rsquo;d like Ishbia to just buy us a championship, it&rsquo;s good for the league that he can&rsquo;t do that. I think we&rsquo;ve got a good balance here</p>

You just need to get creative like Eagles do with their cap and their love of void years. Or do what most teams do and just know 1-2 years will be a little tight cap wise, but then with new QB contracts each year your QB will be on a very manageable contract last 2-3 years of his deal. And rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Teams basically just need to keep extending their QB before the deal is up to manage the cap fine. What the Cowboys are doing with Dak right now (and last time) is NFL salary cap 101 what not to do.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you really do need a top 12ish QB to make a deep playoff run. Winning with say Foles is an anomaly. So yeah even on huge ass contracts teams with top QBs still have an advantage. We don’t need to give them an even bigger one.</p>

      <label for="ldmp15n" class="commentText"><p>They really don&rsquo;t.  SB winning QBs almost never make over 12% of the salary cap.  The list of QBs making over 12% and winning a SB:</p>

<ul>
<li>Patrick Mahomes</li>
<li>Tom Brady</li>
<li>Peyton Manning</li>
<li>Steve Young</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s it.  That&rsquo;s the full list. In the entire salary cap era, it&rsquo;s only done by 4 QBs.  Teams that pay their QBs do NOT have an advantage anymore unless they have a guy that&rsquo;s in the running for a spot on top 5 QB of all time lists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just need to get creative like Eagles do with their cap and their love of void years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eagles are a great example.  They won with Hurts taking up 0.6% of the cap.  And they&rsquo;ve largely shed talent since then, despite drafting well and managing the cap well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, you really do need a top 12ish QB to make a deep playoff run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true.  And unfortunately, those deep playoff runs are most likely going to end against a team with a QB on a rookie deal or budget deal on a team loaded with talent because of it.</p>

      <label for="ldmqqrd" class="commentText"><p>…that’s my point. Hence why I said 1-2 years of the big QB contracts are often taken as down years but the rest of the contract is manageable if you continue to extend the QB.</p>

<p>Josh Allen for example. <span class="math inline">\(30.3mm cap hit this year. 2024 NFL salary cap per team is \)</span>255.4mm. That number is…. less than 12%. Bills have dead cap issues this year though so this is kind of a dead year for them imo. They decided to just eat it all this season, probably for the best.</p>

<p>Jalen Hurts big ass contract. His cap hit 2024 is <span class="math inline">\(13.6mm. Next is \)</span>21.7mm. Next is $31.7mm… in 2026 when the total team cap will be much higher. That is? Less than 12%.</p>

<p>The NFL salary cap rules allow for a lot of leeway how you structure the actual cap hits. Eagles take it to the extreme as I said with their void years. But even if you do it the normal way, it’s manageable. Just need to extend the QB. Only 1-2 years of the contract will be above 12% usually (or within that general realm).</p>

<p>Hurts cap hit is low because this is technically his 5th year option year, and most of his money isn&rsquo;t real money.

<p>It’s almost like you can’t read lmao. Bills will extend Allen and rework the contract moving around where the cap hits are. And also, the salary for the cap keeps increasing every year…. Sure a couple years in there could be tight but Bills will rework the contract around certain years to go all in.</p>

<p>Again, hence the Eagles doing what’s allowed under the cap rules. You can move around cap hits lol.</p>

<p>Definitely sucks now, but give it a few years and the FA market will just adjust again (especially once older contracts expire).</p>

<p>A few years ago, 18-20 min was overpaid for a quality role player, but now, it&rsquo;s the new norm.</p>

Teams are having to work around salary situations that made sense under the old CBA that don’t make sense anymore. It’s probably going to impact the salaries for good but not great players the most, because signing your third-fifth best players to contracts that are 10% or more of the second apron threshold doesn’t make nearly as much sense if you already have two max (or near max) contract players. If we use the Nuggets as an example, they probably don’t have to pay $140 million for their top 4 players going forward under the new rules, after the contracts from the old CBA phase out.</p>

<p>But in the NBA, there is no replacing production, even from role players if you are over a cap. There are minamum contracts, but they are that for a reason. Rookies take a while to get up to NBA speed and still most draftees never do anything for their team. It&rsquo;s a crapshoot after pick 5.</p>

<p>But the Nuggets <em>could</em> have kept KCP. They were allowed to offer just as much as the Magic did. The front-office/ownership just didn’t believe it was worth the money.</p>

<p>They likely would have been in the 2nd Apron, and wouldn’t have as many other avenues to improve, but they could have kept KCP. In fact, they technically could have kept KCP and still ducked the 2nd Apron. One option would be to use another asset (1st Round Pick, DaRon Holmes, Julian Strawther, Peyton Watson, etc) to convince a team to take Zeke Nnaji. Heck, ideally they should have realized the effect of the 2nd Apron last off-season, and just refused to waste all that money on Nnaji all that money in the first place.</p>

<p>It isn’t the 2nd Apron that killed the Nuggets. It’s their poor team building and refusal to spend money.</p>

<p>Nuggets FO didn&rsquo;t think he was worth the money <em>because of the 2nd apron.</em> I am 100% sure they would have re-signed KCP if the 2nd apron didn&rsquo;t exist and they could have just gone over the cap with no downsides.</p>

<p>The heavy luxury tax penalties at this threshold are not new. The Nuggets let KCP walk because of costs, which would have been the case last year or the year before. Second apron didn’t affect this.</p>

<p>Second apron just affects the ease of doing <em>other</em> transactions when you’re at that level. If you just want to keep your guys together like the Celtics it’s not particularly harder now, it just costs a lot like it always did.</p>

They also could have not offerend Nnaji 8mil a year last season or could have offloaded him with an asset but chose not to do so. This is a problem of the Nuggets own creation.</p>

<p>Not really tho. It limits how many middle tier players can be stacked on one team, that already has 3 all star players on it, ie KCP &amp; Denver. KCP can still get his money but he has to be willing to go to aother team that may not be a contender. And thats the point of the 2nd apron.</p>

<p>Spread the wealth of talent in the league. KCP having to go to a up and coming Orlando, which makes them legit, is better for the league than him being on an already stacked Denver team, that is a contender with or without him.</p>

      <label for="ldljyev" class="commentText"><p>The Second Apron rules don&rsquo;t really have strong opinions on what type of player should get more money, it will depend how it plays out. Theoretically it could punish role players if teams shift into &ldquo;all max and min contract&rdquo; rosters. It could also punish stars, if teams decide they do need non-min contract role players, and so can no longer afford two super-max deals and need to let a home-grown talent leave to get a max deal somewhere else. Who the winners and losers will be on the players side remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The point of the second apron is that it makes teams that go over the salary cap by enormous amounts have a much harder time competing (so why would a team spend more if it makes their roster worse). This means teams with lots of salary cap exceptions (e.g. teams that have built their roster instead of buying it - Boston now, GSW before them) will not be able to remain dominant for long stretches of time. Their top talent will demand salaries that compensate them for what they&rsquo;re worth, and if teams exercise their salary cap exceptions to re-sign them and go over the second luxury tax apron they&rsquo;ll be punished both financially and in terms of the kinds of trades/signings they can make to improve the pieces around those stars. This means teams without those cap exceptions will be able to make better moves, and do a better job building rosters that can compete.</p>

Denver could have went over their cap space to sign KCP as they had bird rights, meaning that had more theoretical money to spend.  Since he went to Orlando, the ability to spend that money just disappears.  So the pool of money to spend on players shrunk.</p>

<p>It’s very convoluted, but if there are rules that disincentivize over the cap teams to re-sign their own players, that rule is going to lessen the available pool of money for all players.  That’s just how a soft cap league with Bird rights works.</p>

<p>If that money can&rsquo;t be spent on anybody else I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s not really the same pool. It&rsquo;s a different one attached to it via an overflow. KCP would&rsquo;ve gotten the same money from Denver, but Denver thought he wasn&rsquo;t worth the extra tax. It doesn&rsquo;t matter for the player because he got his money.</p>

<p>I get your point though. If he resigned those 22 millions could have gone to someone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Players and owners collectively bargained to split <strong>49% to 51%</strong> of basketball-related income.  To make sure that players only receive their split, each team withholds 10% of their players’ individual salaries from their paychecks and deposits this amount into an escrow account.  At the end of each season, the NBA  determines whether and how much of the money goes to the players <strong>or back to the league</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine. There is and has always been a cap on players&rsquo; share of BRI, and teams going over the cap or even the the tax does not cause players to receive more money. The cap rules only impact the distribution of salaries, not the overall compensation. Further, the cap itself <em>isn&rsquo;t 51% of BRI</em>. It&rsquo;s closer to 44%, because so many teams operate above the cap. There&rsquo;s significant room between the salary cap, the tax level, the first apron, and the second apron.</p>

<p>Great teams built thought the draft will be torn apart by the cap. Nuggets, OKC, Boston, Minnesota, etc will all soon or have already lose what made them special.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to follow 2 guys while the rest of the team is in a constant state of change.</p>

<p>If they were paid what they were actually worth, y&rsquo;all would easily be able to afford role players. Instead, they are overpaid and their are consequences of that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there was no &ldquo;ramp up&rdquo; to this change, so teams that already overpaid people are low key fucked. but that will fix itself in a few years anyway.</p>

<p>With the new rules, you choose between 3 max player and shit depth or 2 max players and good depth.</p>

<p>Having guys like KP, MPJ, Jrue as 3rd and 4th option is ridiculous when they would be the 1st or 2nd option on some teams.</p>

Isnt the point of Bird Rights that you can go over the cap to resign a home grown talent (3 years on your team), why would that be transferred with a player in a trade when by definition the new team didnt have them for 3 year or develop them. I think most guys who are being signed to extensions with Bird rights are guys who were traded in the last year or two and dont really fit the original intent of the rule and is leading to this massive salary cap confusion (think White and Holiday on the celtics and how people are confused how they can resign them)</p>

<p>In the other hand, unlimited % contracts would be a disaster. The NBA is more of a player focused leage, as opposed to jersey focused. NHL fans will follow thier team no matter who they sign. There is a much higher percentage of NBA plans who follow thier favorite player regardless of the team. Because of that, payong the face of your team silly amounts makes more sense (not good sense, though). It only takes one owner to offer somebofy +50% of the cap to make the market untenable.</p>

      <label for="ldmndb7" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. It opens up more team building opportunities for executives and fans, especially if the salary match trade rules were eliminated.</p>

<p>The current NBA essentially has 0 free agency, because outright signings are convoluted and difficult. Few teams have cap space to execute outright signings (as in other major sports). Most signing are executed via a S&amp;T, which requires the team losing a player to take back a poo poo platter of assets to facilitate.</p>

<p>In the NHL, Teams with good, but overpaid players, could trade those players for assets by using their cap space as a different type of assets. Teams that need those key, not quiet star players have a clear way to obtain them. Fans don’t need a PHD to understand whether their favorite team can obtain another piece.</p>

<p>Finally, signing your players at the right time becomes more important. In the NHL, timing the signing of a young player is key. Too early, and the player might not pan out. Too late, and too much of your cap will be tied to one player. The current NBA is essentially “give X player the max”.</p>

      <label for="ldmqj9g" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s basically the main issue I can think of.  It took a massive amount of lucky events happening for GSW, mainly Steph on a relatively low deal because of legit injury concerns, but no one wants that for sure.  Iirc, the PA was being blamed for that.  They were negotiating a gradual cap increase, but they fought for an immediate spike.  That, in turn, put GS within a couple of doable moves to land KD.  However I don&rsquo;t think anyone realistically expected KD to be that shameless.</p>

      <label for="ldn0x3t" class="commentText"><p>Yep, that was a bit of lightning in a bottle. It took multiple one time events (ie. Steph&rsquo;s injury and rise, Barnes rejecting his deal, the one time salary cap jump that made KD possible.).  Lacob and Co. only kept spending because the revenue stream of this Steph Curry led franchise is pretty massive, but even before the new CBA they&rsquo;ve been talking about getting back under the luxury and repeater tax as it&rsquo;s massive now.</p>

<p>I think these rules were more to temper an owner like Ballmer who could theoretically keep spending into the repeater to build a super team and that would ultimately impact the whole market.  The middle market teams don&rsquo;t want to spend like that and realistically none of the owners want to frequently extend themselves into the luxury and repeater.</p>

<p>The additional penalities put a damper on that.  I do wonder if it ultimately adjusts the market for the number of max contracts handed out, lessens roleplayers salaries, or just kills dynasties going forward.  Something will have to give somewhere.  Maybe the NBAPA comes back and wants to look at it again in the next CBA?  Though I doubt the owners will give up the ground they&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>

<p>Not every player can be a “Max” player.  Teams and Players will have to negotiate.  Feelings will be hurt.   Teams are not going to be able to pay 30M a year for mid level role players.</p>

      <label for="ldngu55" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s just the two vastly different nature of the two sports.  Basketball is a 5v5 game where it’s pretty free compared to baseball being a series of 1v1 sequential plays and there’s just so many different variables .  In basketball you can just feed your best player but in baseball you can’t really do that.  You could buy all the best players in baseball but it won’t pan out.  We’ve seen the Dodgers have some of the highest payrolls but then lose to a barely .500 wild card team.</p>

Get to keep him forever cause you’re the only team that can offer him the most, or B. You get to trade him for a million assets. No franchise player will ever be able to leave in free agency again, best chance to is to find a Brunson who flourishes after you get him</p>
