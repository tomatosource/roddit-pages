<blockquote>
<p><em>I asked Adam Silver if he&rsquo;s at all concerned that the &ldquo;second apron&rdquo; and increased complexities of the CBA are leaving average fans confused. His response:</em></p>

<p>ADAM SILVER: &ldquo;I would say certainly yes, always try to find that balance that we want a system both that substantively serves its goals in terms of putting every team in a position to compete, but at the same time you&rsquo;re right, we want it to be understandable to fans, and to the media for that matter as well, and to our broadcasters as they&rsquo;re explaining it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, it&rsquo;s early days in this deal. This whole notion of a second apron, unfortunately by definition it gets fairly complicated. Sometimes simple rules — while we&rsquo;d all like to deal with that, the nuances, life is complicated and the systems become inherently more complicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re paying a lot of attention to it and we&rsquo;ll see. I think in the first instance, there&rsquo;s still a learning curve for our teams, as I was saying earlier. Not that our teams didn&rsquo;t understand it, but when you see it in actual operation, see how it&rsquo;s affecting general managers and their ability to move certain players, then it really begins to sink in.&rdquo;</p>

<li><p>It does, it has many. For example, if teams make substantive losses, or league revenues crash, the teams can reneg on the CBA. It was floated when COVID hit, but the players and teams agreed to a compromise.</p></li>

<li><p>Why would it have a take-back clause if &ldquo;fans don&rsquo;t understand it&rdquo;? The CBA process is long and tedious, and the point is to give stability to owner-player relations. The CBA rules were instituted so owners and players could both get what they consider a fair deal. If they undo the second tax apron they still need to come up with a new agreement that fulfills the desires of both the players and the teams.</p></li>

<p>Most of the “major restrictions” have been more about owners having an excuse to be cheap, and less about actual cap ramifications. The Clippers could have given Paul George the exact same 4-year contract that the 76ers offered him. The Nuggets could have paid KCP the same amount he got from the Magic. On the other end, the Celtics proved you can still pay everyone huge contract if you want.</p>

      <label for="ldmabv3" class="commentText"><p>You misread or misremembered it. I believe the headline you&rsquo;re referring to is that no player got the full MLE and a multi-year deal.</p>

<p>The Warriors gave Melton the entire MLE, but only on a 1 year deal.</p>

<p>As of this post, 3 teams have used most of their MLE on a signing (Bulls, Clippers, Mavs).</p>

<p>The Sixers also gave Kelly Oubre a 2-year deal with their entire MLE. But since the Sixers were a cap space team, their MLE is technically called the &ldquo;room exception&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s smaller than the full MLE.</p>

<p>The Rockets and the Clippers also used their bi-annual exception on a player. Aaron Holiday for the Rockets and Nicolas Batum for the Clippers. This isn&rsquo;t the MLE, but it is free money that most teams could use if they wanted to.</p>

The salary floor changes, the extra two-way player slot, the second round exception, and the larger year-over-year raises on extensions are just some examples of tangible wins for the players&rsquo; bottom line.</p>

<p>The Rockets would not have dumped <span class="math inline">\(40 million onto Fred VanVleet's lap, and the same can be said about the Pistons dumping \)</span>26 million onto Tobias Harris, if it were not for the salary floor changes. The fact that their deals were structured to be short-term so that there are no long-term cap implications just shows that teams are dumping huge amounts of money on players just because they have to.</p>

<p>2024-25 Luxury Tax: 170.8</p>

<p>1st Apron: 178.1</p>

<p>2nd Apron: 188.9</p>

<p>Even before the existence of apron restrictions only a few teams would go more than 7 million over the tax. Even fewer would go 18 million over the tax.  The aprons are just cover for a majority of owners to use as a scapegoat for money they probably weren&rsquo;t going to spend anyways.</p>

<p>The only major change I would make is that the difference between a Super Max and a regular Max shouldn’t affect the salary cap. Just pay it to the players, but don’t count it towards the team salary. It’s stupid that teams are technically incentivized to have their players <em>not</em> make an All-NBA team.</p>

<p>Definitely sucks now, but give it a few years and the FA market will just adjust again (especially once older contracts expire).</p>

<p>A few years ago, 18-20 min was overpaid for a quality role player, but now, it&rsquo;s the new norm.</p>

<p>Edit: actually % of the cap might be a. better indicator than 20 mil.</p>

      <label for="ldlvrh8" class="commentText"><p>The old contracts is the big factor in how the offseason is playing out I think. Teams are having to work around salary situations that made sense under the old CBA that don’t make sense anymore. It’s probably going to impact the salaries for good but not great players the most, because signing your third-fifth best players to contracts that are 10% or more of the second apron threshold doesn’t make nearly as much sense if you already have two max (or near max) contract players. If we use the Nuggets as an example, they probably don’t have to pay $140 million for their top 4 players going forward under the new rules, after the contracts from the old CBA phase out.</p>

<p>But in the NBA, there is no replacing production, even from role players if you are over a cap. There are minamum contracts, but they are that for a reason. Rookies take a while to get up to NBA speed and still most draftees never do anything for their team. It&rsquo;s a crapshoot after pick 5.</p>

<p>But the Nuggets <em>could</em> have kept KCP. They were allowed to offer just as much as the Magic did. The front-office/ownership just didn’t believe it was worth the money.</p>

<p>They likely would have been in the 2nd Apron, and wouldn’t have as many other avenues to improve, but they could have kept KCP. In fact, they technically could have kept KCP and still ducked the 2nd Apron. One option would be to use another asset (1st Round Pick, DaRon Holmes, Julian Strawther, Peyton Watson, etc) to convince a team to take Zeke Nnaji. Heck, ideally they should have realized the effect of the 2nd Apron last off-season, and just refused to waste all that money on Nnaji all that money in the first place.</p>

<p>It isn’t the 2nd Apron that killed the Nuggets. It’s their poor team building and refusal to spend money.</p>

<p>Nuggets FO didn&rsquo;t think he was worth the money <em>because of the 2nd apron.</em> I am 100% sure they would have re-signed KCP if the 2nd apron didn&rsquo;t exist and they could have just gone over the cap with no downsides.</p>

<p>The heavy luxury tax penalties at this threshold are not new. The Nuggets let KCP walk because of costs, which would have been the case last year or the year before. Second apron didn’t affect this.</p>

<p>Second apron just affects the ease of doing <em>other</em> transactions when you’re at that level. If you just want to keep your guys together like the Celtics it’s not particularly harder now, it just costs a lot like it always did.</p>

      <label for="ldlyifz" class="commentText"><p>It does affect stars in a way. It makes salary negotiations more objective and paired to that stars&rsquo; production. So going forward, I think there&rsquo;ll be fewer guys who are considered &ldquo;overpaid&rdquo;. The only real exceptions are the guys who are more valuable for their franchise than they are on the market. That&rsquo;s basically every franchise player on the rookie max, e.g. Franz Wagner, Cade Cunningham, etc.</p>

<p>It’s bad because all it does is limit how much money middle-tier players will get</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really tho. It limits how many middle tier players can be stacked on one team, that already has 3 all star players on it, ie KCP &amp; Denver. KCP can still get his money but he has to be willing to go to aother team that may not be a contender. And thats the point of the 2nd apron.</p>

<p>Spread the wealth of talent in the league. KCP having to go to a up and coming Orlando, which makes them legit, is better for the league than him being on an already stacked Denver team, that is a contender with or without him.</p>

      <label for="ldljyev" class="commentText"><p>The Second Apron rules don&rsquo;t really have strong opinions on what type of player should get more money, it will depend how it plays out. Theoretically it could punish role players if teams shift into &ldquo;all max and min contract&rdquo; rosters. It could also punish stars, if teams decide they do need non-min contract role players, and so can no longer afford two super-max deals and need to let a home-grown talent leave to get a max deal somewhere else. Who the winners and losers will be on the players side remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The point of the second apron is that it makes teams that go over the salary cap by enormous amounts have a much harder time competing (so why would a team spend more if it makes their roster worse). This means teams with lots of salary cap exceptions (e.g. teams that have built their roster instead of buying it - Boston now, GSW before them) will not be able to remain dominant for long stretches of time. Their top talent will demand salaries that compensate them for what they&rsquo;re worth, and if teams exercise their salary cap exceptions to re-sign them and go over the second luxury tax apron they&rsquo;ll be punished both financially and in terms of the kinds of trades/signings they can make to improve the pieces around those stars. This means teams without those cap exceptions will be able to make better moves, and do a better job building rosters that can compete.</p>

      <label for="ldmbg62" class="commentText"><p>Except again it’s not.  Denver could have went over their cap space to sign KCP as they had bird rights, meaning that had more theoretical money to spend.  Since he went to Orlando, the ability to spend that money just disappears.  So the pool of money to spend on players shrunk.</p>

<p>It’s very convoluted, but if there are rules that disincentivize over the cap teams to re-sign their own players, that rule is going to lessen the available pool of money for all players.  That’s just how a soft cap league with Bird rights works.</p>

<p>If that money can&rsquo;t be spent on anybody else I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s not really the same pool. It&rsquo;s a different one attached to it via an overflow. KCP would&rsquo;ve gotten the same money from Denver, but Denver thought he wasn&rsquo;t worth the extra tax. It doesn&rsquo;t matter for the player because he got his money.</p>

<p>I get your point though. If he resigned those 22 millions could have gone to someone else.</p>

      <label for="ldm8g9c" class="commentText"><p>It does though. It’s a soft cap league, which means teams can (and have in the past) spent more than the cap.  That’s what the aprons are denoting-how much over the cap you went.  Putting such restrictions on apron teams is in essence creating a hard cap league without calling it that.  The point of this is to drive down spending on players.</p>

      <label for="ldmao8r" class="commentText"><p>There was an agreed upon minimum as you are saying, but since the negotiation didn’t include a hard cap there was no theoretical maximum as long as the owner is willing to pay taxes.  Which is what we saw with the Warriors before the new rules.  Players had opportunities to get paid more than that 51% as long as an owner would shell out the penalty.  That’s essentially gone because the new apron rules are way too restrictive.</p>

<p>It’s a practical pay cut even if it’s not officially.  Like when a company keeps your salary the same but cuts vacations days and bonuses</p>

      <label for="ldm3lot" class="commentText"><p>Can someone explain to me why a players bird rights can be transferred in a trade? Isnt the point of Bird Rights that you can go over the cap to resign a home grown talent (3 years on your team), why would that be transferred with a player in a trade when by definition the new team didnt have them for 3 year or develop them. I think most guys who are being signed to extensions with Bird rights are guys who were traded in the last year or two and dont really fit the original intent of the rule and is leading to this massive salary cap confusion (think White and Holiday on the celtics and how people are confused how they can resign them)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Salary ceiling and floor defined within CBA.</p></li>

<li><p>player can sign for any amount above the minimum, but is limited to 8 years on a contract. Increases and decreases in salary can only be within a certain %.</p></li>

<li><p>Total $ / Years = AAV, which counts against the cap. Total AAV of all players must be within ceiling and floor.</p></li>

<li><p>Teams can retain 50% of salary for 3 contracts in a trade.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It would help rebuilding teams turnover rosters faster. For example, This would allow the bulls to get value for Lavine.</p>

      <label for="ldmgkit" class="commentText"><p>Retaining contract money would be huge.</p>

<p>In the other hand, unlimited % contracts would be a disaster. The NBA is more of a player focused leage, as opposed to jersey focused. NHL fans will follow thier team no matter who they sign. There is a much higher percentage of NBA plans who follow thier favorite player regardless of the team. Because of that, payong the face of your team silly amounts makes more sense (not good sense, though). It only takes one owner to offer somebofy +50% of the cap to make the market untenable.</p>

      <label for="ldmafov" class="commentText"><p>I think a lot of these issues could be fixed by a simple Drafted Supermax exception. The difference between a super max and a regular max shouldn’t count against the cap. This would achieve what the supermax was intended to do which is keep stars in place and allow team to build around them properly.</p>
