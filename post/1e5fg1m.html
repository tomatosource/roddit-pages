<blockquote>
<p><em>I asked Adam Silver if he&rsquo;s at all concerned that the &ldquo;second apron&rdquo; and increased complexities of the CBA are leaving average fans confused. His response:</em></p>

<p>ADAM SILVER: &ldquo;I would say certainly yes, always try to find that balance that we want a system both that substantively serves its goals in terms of putting every team in a position to compete, but at the same time you&rsquo;re right, we want it to be understandable to fans, and to the media for that matter as well, and to our broadcasters as they&rsquo;re explaining it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, it&rsquo;s early days in this deal. This whole notion of a second apron, unfortunately by definition it gets fairly complicated. Sometimes simple rules — while we&rsquo;d all like to deal with that, the nuances, life is complicated and the systems become inherently more complicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re paying a lot of attention to it and we&rsquo;ll see. I think in the first instance, there&rsquo;s still a learning curve for our teams, as I was saying earlier. Not that our teams didn&rsquo;t understand it, but when you see it in actual operation, see how it&rsquo;s affecting general managers and their ability to move certain players, then it really begins to sink in.&rdquo;</p>

<li><p>It does, it has many. For example, if teams make substantive losses, or league revenues crash, the teams can reneg on the CBA. It was floated when COVID hit, but the players and teams agreed to a compromise.</p></li>

<li><p>Why would it have a take-back clause if &ldquo;fans don&rsquo;t understand it&rdquo;? The CBA process is long and tedious, and the point is to give stability to owner-player relations. The CBA rules were instituted so owners and players could both get what they consider a fair deal. If they undo the second tax apron they still need to come up with a new agreement that fulfills the desires of both the players and the teams.</p></li>

<p>Definitely sucks now, but give it a few years and the FA market will just adjust again (especially once older contracts expire).</p>

<p>A few years ago, 18-20 min was overpaid for a quality role player, but now, it&rsquo;s the new norm.</p>

<p>Edit: actually % of the cap might be a. better indicator than 20 mil.</p>

      <label for="ldljyev" class="commentText"><p>The Second Apron rules don&rsquo;t really have strong opinions on what type of player should get more money, it will depend how it plays out. Theoretically it could punish role players if teams shift into &ldquo;all max and min contract&rdquo; rosters. It could also punish stars, if teams decide they do need non-min contract role players, and so can no longer afford two super-max deals and need to let a home-grown talent leave to get a max deal somewhere else. Who the winners and losers will be on the players side remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The point of the second apron is that it makes teams that go over the salary cap by enormous amounts have a much harder time competing (so why would a team spend more if it makes their roster worse). This means teams with lots of salary cap exceptions (e.g. teams that have built their roster instead of buying it - Boston now, GSW before them) will not be able to remain dominant for long stretches of time. Their top talent will demand salaries that compensate them for what they&rsquo;re worth, and if teams exercise their salary cap exceptions to re-sign them and go over the second luxury tax apron they&rsquo;ll be punished both financially and in terms of the kinds of trades/signings they can make to improve the pieces around those stars. This means teams without those cap exceptions will be able to make better moves, and do a better job building rosters that can compete.</p>
