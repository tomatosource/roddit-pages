      <p>I looked at some of the all-time assist records for the playoffs and I was blown away by how much Magic Johnson dominated some of these statistical categories. Some of these records seem like they may last a looooong time.</p>

<li>Magic Johnson - 2346</li>

<li>John Wall - 9.8</li>

      <label for="li11inv" class="commentText"><p>For total playoff assists, LeBron needs like 270.</p>

<p>Assuming he gets 7 per game, that&rsquo;s about 38 games?</p>

<p>So best case scenario he plays two more post seasons. Only way he gets to 38 games in two post seasons is back to back finals runs.</p>

<p>Possible? Sure.</p>

<p>Is it gonna happen? No.</p>

<p>This is all hypothetical anyway, talking about “could have.” As it stands, nobody has done what Magic has done and it looks like nobody will for the foreseeable future. Even if they do have 2x as long a career like LeBron did.</p>

<p>Call it 4 post seasons, 8 series total. Maybe he makes it to the conference finals one year and gets bounced in the first round the next. Okay, that’s probably 40 games. Assuming he averages close to 7 assists he’s there.</p>

<p>Unlikely, sure, but it could easily happen. Well within the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>It’s all fun and games averaging 10 or more assists per game - but you’re either top level for two decades <strong>or</strong> you make a lot of runs to the finals.</p>

<p>And we’ve had 6 different champions in last 6 years.</p>

<p>Number 3 Stockton is the all time assist leader, which is an unbreakable record itself.  He paired with Malone and made playoff every year of his 19 years career.</p>

      <label for="li48tl6" class="commentText"><p>Me too, but even then, I think it would require an absolutely, ridiculously stacked team on par with those Lakers teams. Like all the Pacers young players need to approach all-star level or better (Walker, Nembhard, and Mathurin). But even if the Pacers hit gold with all those guys, the parity in the modern NBA would make it difficult to keep them for years.</p>

<p>I am about as big a fan as you will find of Tyrese&rsquo; game and passing in general, but those records are absolutely <em>absurd</em> given how far those Lakers teams went in the playoffs. I think Tyrese could break the single game record though. I think he put up 22 in a game last year on a bum hamstring.</p>

For comparison, Trae Young, a contemporary, not a legend like Magic, already averages 9 assists for his <em>much</em> bigger sample size playoff career against <em>much</em> tougher opponents. If you think he has a chance to beat Magic Johnson in this stat you are just already factually wrong. Its like a rookie pitcher in baseball winning his first couple decisions and you thinking he could catch Cy Young. Just unfathomably stupid.</p>

<p>All the slander on Dream Team is preposterous. The only real thing lacking there was maybe Shaq and then a prime Larry Bird. That team could easily trade with anybody today. A lineup of Magic, Jordan, DRob, Pippen or Malone, and Barkley would have been just fucking nuts. Bird was still decent for threes at that point but a little slow. If he was prime there is no way that team is losing a 7 to anybody without a ghastly fight.</p>

      <label for="li2hcsp" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m gonna say the one thing that puts an end to this discussion. Mind you, not in favor of one or the other, but in the sense that it will reveal why the direct comparison is futile to begin with. Competition is much better now. Magic played 40 years ago. If you were to split the history of the league in half, Magic played in the former and Curry is playing in the current. No sport in existence hasn&rsquo;t improved it&rsquo;s quality of players immensely between the first half of it&rsquo;s existence and it&rsquo;s current iteration. You simply can&rsquo;t compare stats because stats are just a reflection of whatever version of the game that player experienced. And since we can&rsquo;t control the most important variable, competition, well we can&rsquo;t even begin to make any sort of accurate comparison between these two players.</p>

      <label for="li2ie7r" class="commentText"><p>That is why these lists are about Greatness and not Best/Most Skilled.</p>

<p>I do believe Steph Curry is a more skilled basketball player than Magic Johnson the same way I think Ja Morant is a more skilled basketball player than Jerry West.</p>

<p>But Greatness is something else: it encompasses everything. Accolades, Statistics/Records, Impact/Legacy, etc. Whose career was greater?</p>

<p>And it’s clear that Magic Johnson is the “greater” player with a much more impressive resume overall.</p>

      <label for="li2nvlw" class="commentText"><p>The comment you responded to stated &ldquo;Curry is better though&rdquo; and then you engaged in debate. Which by your admission just now would be entirely different discussion. However, you still engaged by citing stats without clarifying that better is different than great. So it was a little unclear what angle you were approaching that from.</p>

And I engaged with a comment that engaged with mine in that same manner. And in my response, I made sure to use the word “greatest”. And that’s when the argument begins.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, that’s what everyone means when they discuss these things. Nobody is talking about raw skill or else these lists start to look hilarious.</p>

      <label for="li2qpnb" class="commentText"><p>I do agree with you in that they are slightly different categories that overlap in a Venn Diagram sort of way. But, what you are saying and how you responded to that comment doesn&rsquo;t really line up. If you feel that they are truly different discussions (greater vs better) then you simply could have said that. But you went on and listed stats and direct comparisons as if you were engaging in a who is better debate. In fact, you directly referenced differences in how each one is <em>better</em> than the other. All of this is to say that, well, you seem to be also implying without outright saying that you feel that Magic is the better player <em>in addition</em> to the greater player.</p>

<p>From where I’m standing, it looks to me like Steph hasn’t been able to do a single thing that Magic could do…</p>

<p>In what world does someone think Steph can rebound or assist or play 5 positions the way Magic did? Like, is he just choosing not to do it? Why hasn’t he done any of that yet? 🤣</p>

<p>Does he just…not feel like beating Magic in any one thing that isn’t 3PT shooting?</p>

      <label for="li23fkw" class="commentText"><p>They realistically should both have 2 each. Kareem was robbed in 80’ due to his political activism &amp; the NBA wanting Magic to be the next face of the league. He did not outperform Kareem, despite his legendary game 7. Kareem averaged 33pts 14reb 3asts 5blks on 55/0/81. Magic averaged 22pts 11reb 9asts 3stl on 57/0/88. Kareem led them through all 6 games until injury with having a greater impact on the defensive end, not to discount Magic’s heroics in game 7, it was absolutely Kareem who was the captain of the ship for the first ring.</p>

<p>In contrast, Curry was the best player in the 2015 title. Iggy was a vital piece in slowing down lebron, but Curry lead that team &amp; without him they don’t even make it to that finals nor do they win. Iggy’s performance was not better than Curry’s. Curry averaged 26pts 5reb 6asts 2stl on 44/38/89. Iggy averaged 16pts 6reb 4asts 1stl  on 52/40/36. Curry was the true leader of the ship &amp; his performance eclipsed Iggy’s.</p>

<p>Thats why idc about accolades as much as the eye test. Steph just breaks the game in ways Magic can’t. Magic was put into the game with the greatest basketball player ever &amp; leeched off of him &amp; when he retired, Magic couldn’t win. That is just the facts. Curry meanwhile did it with &amp; without his greatest teammate in Kevin Durant. Magic is the second greatest point guard but Steph has surpassed him &amp; it’s not even a discussion anymore tbh.</p>

      <label for="li26vho" class="commentText"><p>There’s just so much wrong with your comment and your basketball takes in general.</p>

<p>You say you prefer the eye test but then completely disregard the fact that Iggy held Lebron to 40% FG which for LeBron’s playstyle (and his resume) is a remarkable defensive performance, and you also completely disregard the fact that Magic played all 5 positions in that 1980 Finals Game 6. No, not Game 7; there was no Game 7.</p>

<p>In that Game 6 to win the Finals in stunning fashion without Kareem, Magic recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists. And played <em>all five positions</em>. It’s literally the greatest game of Magic’s career. He did it <em>all</em> and brought the trophy home.</p>

<p>Magic proved that Kareem was not the most valuable player. If he was, they would not be able to win the championship without him. The truth is that the team could not win without Magic, but luckily Magic was there for all 6 games. When Kareem was out, it didn’t matter: Magic doubled his averages and made up for Kareem.</p>

<p>Magic deserved all of his Finals MVPs.</p>

<p>But what’s funny about all this is even if I decided to agree with you and we have it your way by granting Curry an extra FMVP and taking one away from Magic: we end up at a tie.</p>

<p>And then you still have to come to terms with Curry being All-NBA 1st Team only <strong>4 times</strong> in his career and, again, Magic doing so much more in a shorter career.</p>

<p>Like, this isn’t even close. We can literally alter accolades and take away from Magic and add to Steph and we still don’t have a scenario where Steph is ahead. 😭</p>

<p>And also, you seem to only want to talk about one teammate each. I’m honestly kind of shocked that the first thing a Curry fan will jump to is the teams players played with considering the dude has had the absolute pleasure of playing with, what, 3-4 HOFers for more of his rings? Seriously?</p>

<p>How is the Curry fan bringing up teammates? 😭 He had arguably the most skilled basketball player of all-time in Kevin Durant, a Top 5 shooter all-time in Klay Thompson, a DPOY/All-Defense/All-Star in Draymond Green, All-Defense/All-Star in Andre Iguodala, etc.</p>

<p>What are we doing man? You really wanna talk teammates? Really?</p>

<p>And let’s be real: you’re only saying Kareem is the GOAT because of Magic destroying Curry’s career. Because there’s literally zero argument for Kareem. Like, what case can you make for him being the greatest? He lost the points lead to Lebron, MJ has same rings but 3x as many FMVPs and a whole host of other leads, like that’s it. All Kareem had left was the Points and that’s gone now. There’s <em>nothing</em> left for Kareem.</p>

<p>And it’s now making sense to me why you won’t give me your list. Because Kareem is only your GOAT while you’re debating Magic vs. Steph; he’s merely a tool. You know he isn’t and don’t even believe it yourself. Crazy stuff.</p>

<p>Edit: And there was no conspiracy against Kareem for the FMVP in ‘80 because the NBA was happy giving him the MVP in the regular season. Don’t try that nonsense.</p>

First of all magics rookie season when kareem was OUT in game 6 against Philly, magic stepped up and put up a 40 point near triple double. WITHOUT kareem in a game 6 they needed to win to clinch the title. </p>

<p>Kareem was great but after like 83,84 he wasn’t their best player that was magic. Kareem was out of his prime for most of magics career. By the time magic came into the league Kareem was 32 basically and his best years were behind him. This argument sounds like something someone who doesn’t even understand basketball history would say </p>

<p>Luka had 178 assists this past postseason, which led the playoffs. Magic averaged 180 across 13 playoff runs (and that’s including first round exits in ‘81 and ‘96). He had fucking 303 assists in 1988, and had five other postseasons with over 200 assists plus another with 192.</p>

<p>To catch magic Luka would have to replicate last year’s playoff run 12 more times. And Luka is the non-Lebron active player with the most realistic shot at catching magic.</p>

      <label for="li2t4u6" class="commentText"><p>LeBron could do it but he would need two deep playoff runs by the Lakers. In 2023 he averaged 6.5 over 16 games when they lost in the WCF. If he did this and the Lakers were able to play in 32 total playoff games over the next two seasons it would give him 208 of the 279 needed. If he could average 8.8 over 32 games he’d break it. I think he has the ability but I don’t know if the Lakers can collectively get deep enough to give him the number of games he would need.</p>

It&rsquo;d be like if Wemby had been drafted onto the Celtics last year.  It&rsquo;s not impossible something like that could happen again, but those records will probably stand for a long time.</p>

<p>(Also, the circumstances of the Lakers ending up with that pick are wild.  The then NO Jazz signed Gale Goodrich away from the Lakers in FA, only for the league to retroactively decide it had been a trade for three of the Jazz&rsquo;s first round picks.)</p>

      <label for="li1j2mq" class="commentText"><p>So, this record is hard to beat since until last reason, all of the highest average assist per game seasons were in the 80s. Magic was a point god during a time of incredibly high assists.</p>

<p>Now, take that into account with that he made the playoffs every season he played (13) and 5 rings. He played 190 playoff games. Lebron has 287, the most of any player.</p>

<p>Unless they decrease the shot clock or get more possessions somehow, it is very unlikely anyone breaks this. Maybe a paradigm shift where pass first guards come back, but that is unlikely.</p>

      <label for="li1m42t" class="commentText"><p>The total playoff assists record is totally breakable. Magic did it in, what, 11 years? That’s crazy, but it’s not unbreakable. Especially since the playoffs are four rounds now instead of three rounds like they were pre 1983 and the first round is bo7 now instead of bo5 like it was during Magic’s career.</p>

<p>It would have to be someone who was part of one or more long-lasting dynasties that made a bunch of deep playoff runs in a row, and they’d have to average a bunch of assists (9+ per game, preferably 10+). And they’d have to have a long, healthy career. But none of that is impossible, or even particularly unlikely; it’ll happen someday. If Magic had played 16 seasons instead of 11 then the record would probably be borderline unbreakable, but the fact that someone could play like 6 whole postseasons more than him in the course of a career makes it a lot easier. Especially since the first round is longer now.</p>

      <label for="li26ah8" class="commentText"><p>These stats are crazy insane and Magic Johnson has forever crowned himself as the ultimate provider of assists. But some factors have to be taken into account when looking at these numbers.
(1) The game was played differently then. The greatest weapon of a team was the center play in the low post. It helps  if the guy playing with you was the greatest scorer of all time for 40 (or more?) years. Not all assists come from Kareem but I guess a great deal came from center/ pick&amp;roll play.</p>

<p>(2) The PG used to be the smallest/ fastest guy on the court. Magic had his height, he was the first big PG. Which in a way introduced the possibility of a point forward. Which gave him an edge on the opponents. Meaning he was lucky he was the right guy at the right time.</p>

<p>(3) Through the years the game changed. From post play to small range to big range. The 3p has become the strongest weapon (after a small James Harden stint which made the FT strong). This made the assist a stat that&rsquo;s gotten rarer. While the PG position still exists most teams have a point forward now. A star player that can create his own shot and gets the most FGA in a game.</p>

<p>I think this number will last at the top of this list. Magic was a unicorn at his time and took his opportunity. The 3p shot is here to stay and teams have gotten more single player oriented. Bottom line Magic was truly fucking good.</p>

<p>Like, it’s not in Stockton’s regular season assist record unbreakable territory, but it’s probably a Kareem scoring record type thing where it’s so unlikely to happen it will take a long, long time for someone to break it, which in Kareem’s case took 4 decades and the most durable player of all time to do it.</p>

<p>Pass first point guards just don’t exist anymore. Chris Paul and Mike Conley are two of the last of their kind remaining. There are freaks like LeBron and Jokic that pop up every now and then but even then you just don’t get volume assists the same way anymore. Tyrese Haliburton is probably the closest thing to a pure point guard left who’s under 30, at least amongst American-born players anyways</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;ll also be hard to beat not just because of the quality of the player, but the whole team.</p>

<p>In order to get that assist, someone has to make a shot consistently, and that person most likely needs to be open in order to do that, which comes down to players making their plays and the coaching staff and management having the right people in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>Not many teams even today are going to match the star power of the showtime Lakers in every aspect.</p>

<p>Granted the standards change so I&rsquo;m not sure how much apg compares from era to era, but 12 and a half as an <em>average</em> is still ridiculous no matter what. In a way I wonder if it helped him in that regard that he retired early. If he had played into his late 30s his per-game average would surely have dropped.  But since even in his 1996 comeback, playing largely in the post, coming off the bench, and having 4 full years of rust, he <em>still</em> averaged 7 apg, just imagine how much crazier his career total would be. He&rsquo;d have a shot at hitting 3000 playoff assists.</p>

<p>He said &ldquo;this time I got to go out on my own terms&rdquo; but also might have had to do with the team role (he wanted to play point) or with how he criticized a younger teammate for getting suspended for bumping a ref - and then he got suspended for the same thing later. Might have all added up to just not enjoying the game like he used to?</p>

<p>In order for his record to be broken, a player would need pantheon-level ball handling, an entire career of deep playoff runs, and high level offensive talent around him to grant assists.</p>

<p>Will Johnson&rsquo;s record last forever? Probably not, because forever is a long time. But you&rsquo;d need the perfect conditions to break it.</p>

      <label for="li1320t" class="commentText"><p>I think most in a playoff game and total playoff assist is possible. Assuming someone like Luka can make a couple deep runs in the next 10 years or so, he might pass Magic. Singular playoff run and career averages are probably secure.</p>
