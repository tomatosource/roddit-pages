      <label for="lnzk4nn" class="commentText"><p>In fairness to his peers, Gretzky had some genuine competitors. Mario Lemieux and Bobby Orr were arguably on his level but both had their careers shortened for health reasons. Then there was Gordie Howe who Gretzky himself considers the GOAT, though a much different style of player from Gretzky. Howe and Orr were both retired or retiring by the time Gretzky was coming into his own, while Lemieux was easily Gretzky&rsquo;s biggest competition during his career - albeit with a few others hovering nearby like Jaromir Jagr and Steve Yzerman.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s goalies who are next to impossible to compare - though there&rsquo;s no confident consensus as to who the best of that position was, which is why they aren&rsquo;t usually solidly in the GOAT conversation. You&rsquo;ll see arguments for Dominik Hasek, Patrick Roy, Martin Brodeur, Terry Sawchuk, Jacques Plante, Ken Dryden, Vladislav Tretiak (though he never came over to the NHL) - you could even make cases for the likes of Bill Durnan, Glenn Hall, Tony Esposito, Georges Vezina, etc.</p>

      <label for="lo0hr6p" class="commentText"><p>Plus Howe was a lot tougher and grittier than Gretzky. It&rsquo;s pretty difficult to compare the two in that regard. Hockey is more than just scoring, as eye popping as Gretzky&rsquo;s numbers are.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d still give the GOAT title to The Great One, but it&rsquo;s not as clear cut as some say. Howe could score, pass, and beat the hell out of the opposing players. He was a feared physical presence. Whereas Gretzky was more of a finesse guy who relied on enforcers to protect him.</p>

<p>And Lemieux and Orr were basically just as skilled as Gretzky but didn&rsquo;t have the longevity.</p>

      <label for="lo0k4t9" class="commentText"><p>Lemieux would have broken Gretzky&rsquo;s career goals record (894). It&rsquo;s not inconceivable that Lemieux might have reached 1,000 goals with a &ldquo;full&rdquo; (~1500 game) career, but 950-ish is more realistic.</p>

<p>Lemieux wouldn&rsquo;t have come close to Gretzky&rsquo;s absurd assists numbers.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t think he would have surpassed Gretzky in points either (goals + assists). I think Gretzky&rsquo;s advantage in playmaking is bigger than Lemieux&rsquo;s advantage in goalscoring. But even if those were even, goals in hockey can have 2 assists counted, so that gives players who tend to get assists more opportunities per goal to accrue points than players who tend to get goals.</p>

      <label for="lo0i63j" class="commentText"><p>Lemieux was probably a slightly better goal scorer than Gretzky (Gretzky himself has said this). Gretzky was probably slightly better as a passer, although it&rsquo;s close. Lemieux had more size. It&rsquo;s a toss up as to who was better in their prime. Unfortunately Lemieux&rsquo;s health issues and missed games put his career slightly lower all-time, but otherwise they would have been neck and neck.</p>

      <label for="lo2c9mr" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough. Gretzky has the highest assists per game ever. Lemieux has the second highest ever. 1.320 compared to 1.129. Gretzky played more games overall, but also more of his prime games in the high-flying 80s when scoring was higher. Lemieux played some years in the low scoring early 2000s. He also lost a lot of crucial games in his prime to cancer and injury.</p>

<p>Lemieux played with some very good teams, but I don&rsquo;t think any of them had the firepower that those 80s Oilers had. So that helped Gretzky a bit.</p>

<p>I agree that Gretzky is the greatest passer, as I already said. But it&rsquo;s possibly a comparison of the greatest and second greatest.</p>

      <label for="lo01xm9" class="commentText"><p>Don Bradman, the cricketer, had a 99.94 batting average in his career. The second highest in history? 61.87.  He&rsquo;s many standard deviations away from #2, let alone the average player. He&rsquo;s got a solid claim to the title of greatest sportsman ever.</p>

<p>Nah. Someone who is very good at an ultra-specific skill shouldn&rsquo;t really be in that conversation. That should be reserved for guys like Wilt, Jim Brown, or Jim Thorpe, or other decathletes probable. People who were truly in the elite tier of multiple athletic endeavors. I mean, on top of everything else, Jim Thorpe won a college ballroom dancing championship.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the only reason Manning had better stats when they were both playing was the dome that Manning played in. Brady had better stats indoors and better stats outdoors, but Manning played so many more games indoors that he had better overall stats.</p>

<p>Also, cutting off Brady because Manning retired is an odd argument I&rsquo;ve never seen applied to any other player comparison. When you let Brady finish his career strong, his rate stats are all similar or better than Manning and he crushes Manning on career stats.</p>

<p>They were saying that if you cut off Brady&rsquo;s career when Manning retired (presumably because stats from the last 10 years are inflated and it is unfair to let Brady benefit from that while Manning doesn&rsquo;t) that Manning was better statistically, and I accept that argument. But I&rsquo;m saying that if you cut off their careers at that point and look at inside/outside splits, Brady&rsquo;s stats were better for both. Manning just played so many more games indoors that his combined stats were better, and it is silly to reward Manning for playing so many games indoors.</p>

This argument is solely based on the fact that when they were both playing from 2000-2015 the popular consensus was Peyton was better that’s why I don’t think Brady is in that tier of transcendency that Gretzky is in. Obviously Brady is the greatest QB of all time and hindsight is going to be very kind to him but Peyton was widely regarded as the better player for most of their careers by just about everyone.</p>

<p>No he really wasn&rsquo;t. You will not find a single solitary person who believes someone else is the best hockey player ever. Even when MJ was three-peating, there were people who would make arguments for others, and those arguments aren&rsquo;t awful.</p>

      <label for="lo1utqn" class="commentText"><p>Depends on when you are talking about. When MJ retired he was essentially the unanimous GOAT. Sure, you will have the outlier detractor in every situation but my point is that just from the standpoint of GOAT vs not GOAT the difference was negligible. I guarantee you there are people out there that don&rsquo;t think Gretzky is the GOAT. Nothing is absolute. You can sit here and argue nitty gritty details but ultimately the situation was the same.</p>

He’s also the first Hall of Famer the team had associated with them (Bingo Smith’s  jersey is also retired, and Campy Russell and Jim Chones are in their Wall of Honor). Also, that Cavs team has probably my favorite name line-up from the ‘70s: Bingo, Foots, Campy, three guys named Jim.</p>

      <label for="lnzcrs3" class="commentText"><p>Scrolled looking for who would share this context! Piggybacking off of you:</p>

<p>In his penultimate season (&lsquo;76), Thurmond was traded to the Cavs a few weeks into the season. They were 6-11 before his arrival, but by all accounts Thurmond&rsquo;s tremendous locker room leadership turned the team around as they went 43-22 the rest of the way (<em>Thurmond was playing 20 mpg off the bench</em>). Cleveland made it to the playoffs for the first time ever and earned a huge Round 1 upset over the favored Bullets who had four stars (<em>Hayes, Unseld, Bing, Chenier</em>) in a series/moment called “The Miracle of Richfield”. (<em>They played in Richfield, a little bit outside Cleveland.</em>)</p>

The Thunder did the same thing, we retired Nick Collisons jersey. He was with us forever, was a franchise tone setter, and was literally referred to as Mr. Thunder. If he was with us for 2 years, retiring his jersey would be ridiculous lol</p>

<p>I was a sixth grader in northeast Ohio at the time. You have no idea how beloved that team was. Thurmond off the bench was similar to Walton coming off the bench for the Celtics in the 80s. Absolute magic. It&rsquo;s not unusual at all for the Cavs to retire his number.</p>

And those guys were often playing 4 games in 5 nights, while flying commercially. There were no team charter flights back then. All those players back then were freakin studs. There was none of this lovey dovey crap either. Guys hated their opponents. They weren&rsquo;t hugging after games and swapping jerseys and going out to dinner EVER!</p>
