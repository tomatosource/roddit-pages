    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I know that Karl Malone was rewarded the MVP during the 96-97 season from many who were sympathetic to his pursuit of the award and may have been influenced by that argument. This is older but Michael Adams got an all-star bid for a pretty decent season but his prior season was amazing and he wasn&rsquo;t selected. Maybe his selection was an apology or a nod for the missight.</p>

      <label for="lnsm3bp" class="commentText"><p>Kobe&rsquo;s last contract was definitely undeserved in terms of playing ability. It was probably deserved in terms of ticket-selling ability, though.</p>

<p>Kobe&rsquo;s first All-star selection was undeserved (15/3/3), as were his 3 selections post-Achilles.</p>

<p>Several of Kobe&rsquo;s later All-Defense selections were also undeserved, and largely based on reputation. There&rsquo;s no world in which 2011 Kobe was legitimately a better defender than 2011 Tony Allen or Iguodala. Kobe was an all-time defender from 1999-2004ish, but by the late 00s he did a lot of ball-watching and freelancing and only turned up his defensive effort in spurts and clutch situations.</p>

      <label for="lnssf1u" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s a lot more common than you think, especially with older players. Teams try to look after them, either because they think it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, but also because it maintains positive relationships with important players, and in particular, player agents. And on some/many situations (someone else mentioned UD) - it is 99-100% part of an earlier handshake to get around the salary cap rules.</p>

<p>2 recent Spurs examples:</p>

<p>LMA&rsquo;s last year in SA was only partially garaunteed (about 6M). Everyone knew the team was gonna either trade or buy him out, and there was zero reason to keep him around on a rebuilding roster. But the team fully garaunteed that last year (25M) so that he got his money, and then still waived him at the deadline so he could go to a contender. (And in return, LMA left about 8M on the table with the buyout).</p>

<p>A couple (?) of years earlier, an aging Pau Gasol had a year left (around 16M) that was either a team or player option (and above his market value at the time). The option was declined in time for free agency (I can&rsquo;t remember who the names were that year). But when the they couldn&rsquo;t get a FA, they then signed Pau to an inexplicable <sup>48</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> years deal, and then I think waived him a year later. The only explanation I can ever come up with at the time was that it was all part of a handshake deal beforehand: &ldquo;We/You decline the option so that we can open up more cap room to chase a big name, but we promise to look after you on the backend if no-one comes&rdquo;&hellip; and that seems pretty consistent with how the Spurs do business.</p>

<p>Mike Conley getting the 2021 all star replacement selection for Devin Booker instead of DeMar DeRozan. It was a sympathy selection for Conley as DeMar had better stats and had the shit spurs in the playoff hunt through the all star break. This one particular pisses me off because this might make or break his hall of fame shot. DeMar is a 6x all star, and every 7x all star but Larry Foust has made the Hall. If DeMar was given that selection combined with his borderline HOF stats and accomplishments, DeMar is probably making hall of fame</p>

The Nuggets had a very fast-paced, high-scoring offense in 1990-91 (1st in the league in points scored, 1st in Pace), but weren&rsquo;t especially efficient (21st in OffRtg), had atrocious defense (last in points allowed and DefRtg), and were one of the worst teams in the league (just 20 wins).</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s weird is that Adams became an All-Star <em>the next year</em> playing for a 25-win Washington team, while averaging poorer numbers (18.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.0/7.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.9 with 4.9 3PTA and 4.6 FTA per game in 35.8 mpg on 24.2 USG%) on worse efficiency (.393/.324/.869 shooting splits, .506 TS% overall, 2.7 turnovers per game).

<p>It was contentious because MJ was still obviously the best player in the league, in the same way LeBron has been the best
player in the league for a lot more years than his mere
4 MVPs.</p>

<p>It was incredibly close voting too, Karl barely squeezed past Mike, but it isn’t any kind of egregious robbery.</p>

      <label for="lnsxem4" class="commentText"><p>Countries qualify for Olympic spots through success in prior tournaments. When a team qualifies for the Olympics, they do not have to use the same players that were on the qualifying roster.</p>

<p>Counties have different processes for selecting players to their Olympic team after qualifying, and some may favor players that were on the qualifying team, but they don’t have to.</p>

<p>Certain players are going to be selected to their national team just for being great in their professional career, even if they haven’t played in a FIBA tournament before. This is probably more common for nations deep in basketball talent, such as the US.</p>

<p>After FIBA approved Embiid to play for the US and after the US earned a spot in the Olympics, Embiid “qualified” for a spot in the US player pool. He was then selected because he is one the very best players in the US player pool, based on his play in the NBA.</p>

<p>If you want to argue that he never should have been approved by FIBA to play for USA, then fine, but once he was approved, there really wasn’t  anything unusual about his being selected for the Olympic team by the US coaching staff.</p>

Do you see any other nations in basketball or any other sport sending random squads with players that never moved a finger for the program before? Doesn&rsquo;t Jaren Jackson deserve to be in Paris instead of Joel Embiid?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you think its kind of weird that Embiid was the only one of 10.000 athletes in Paris that never represented his country before? Don&rsquo;t you think the only reason Embiid was not playing for France was because they asked him to contribute before he gets Goberts spot? Do you think Joel Embiid will ever play for Team USA again in his life?</p>

<p>He couldn&rsquo;t get his ass up to win a few games against Burkina Faso and Guinea Bissau for a decade, then got cold feed and tried to sneak himself into the olympics. And he found the only team that allows you to just show up and cruise to a gold medal, but still proudly claims that he would have played for his home country if they would have simply won a few weeks earlier when he was in Cancun.</p>

<p>He has no sportsmanship.</p>

<p>They start by inviting the best players whether they’ve played for Team USA or not. Maybe when it’s down to the last few spots, they might favor prior Team USA experience, but that might depend on who’s picking the team.

<p>So I guess your issue is really with how team USA picks its players. There’s nothings special about Embiid’s selection for the team, other than he had other options. Yet you’re choosing to make it all about Embiid.</p>

<p>Also are you sure that no Olympic athlete in a team sport made their debut for the team in the Olympics, other than on the men’s US basketball team? Is that your claim?</p>

<p>My claim is Embiid always goes the way of the least resistance and thats why he will never achieve greatness. Its his general perspective on pro sports. He is no compedetor. If you see the fire in Lukas eyes representing Slovenia, you see the difference.</p>
