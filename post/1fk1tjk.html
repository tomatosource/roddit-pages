    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I know that Karl Malone was rewarded the MVP during the 96-97 season from many who were sympathetic to his pursuit of the award and may have been influenced by that argument. This is older but Michael Adams got an all-star bid for a pretty decent season but his prior season was amazing and he wasn&rsquo;t selected. Maybe his selection was an apology or a nod for the missight.</p>

      <label for="lnsm3bp" class="commentText"><p>Kobe&rsquo;s last contract was definitely undeserved in terms of playing ability. It was probably deserved in terms of ticket-selling ability, though.</p>

<p>Kobe&rsquo;s first All-star selection was undeserved (15/3/3), as were his 3 selections post-Achilles.</p>

<p>Several of Kobe&rsquo;s later All-Defense selections were also undeserved, and largely based on reputation. There&rsquo;s no world in which 2011 Kobe was legitimately a better defender than 2011 Tony Allen or Iguodala. Kobe was an all-time defender from 1999-2004ish, but by the late 00s he did a lot of ball-watching and freelancing and only turned up his defensive effort in spurts and clutch situations.</p>

      <label for="lnssf1u" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s a lot more common than you think, especially with older players. Teams try to look after them, either because they think it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, but also because it maintains positive relationships with important players, and in particular, player agents. And on some/many situations (someone else mentioned UD) - it is 99-100% part of an earlier handshake to get around the salary cap rules.</p>

<p>2 recent Spurs examples:</p>

<p>LMA&rsquo;s last year in SA was only partially garaunteed (about 6M). Everyone knew the team was gonna either trade or buy him out, and there was zero reason to keep him around on a rebuilding roster. But the team fully garaunteed that last year (25M) so that he got his money, and then still waived him at the deadline so he could go to a contender. (And in return, LMA left about 8M on the table with the buyout).</p>

<p>A couple (?) of years earlier, an aging Pau Gasol had a year left (around 16M) that was either a team or player option (and above his market value at the time). The option was declined in time for free agency (I can&rsquo;t remember who the names were that year). But when the they couldn&rsquo;t get a FA, they then signed Pau to an inexplicable <sup>48</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> years deal, and then I think waived him a year later. The only explanation I can ever come up with at the time was that it was all part of a handshake deal beforehand: &ldquo;We/You decline the option so that we can open up more cap room to chase a big name, but we promise to look after you on the backend if no-one comes&rdquo;&hellip; and that seems pretty consistent with how the Spurs do business.</p>
