      <p>So one of the pieces from the McDaniels deal might go back overseas. Interesting to see how this could effect the Raptors cap sheet in terms of a potential buyout.</p>

<p>There were rumours a few weeks ago he wanted to go back to europe, but those were quashed. Seems like both sides got what they wanted out of this trade in trading 2 players that were not fit for the team at this point for the roster.</p>

It’s a completely different game and completely different roles. He’s very good but obviously he isn’t going to get the keys to the team</p>

<p>Look at micic for example, wasn’t good for OKC, gets a bigger role in Charlotte and he’s pretty good</p>

      <label for="laurr7r" class="commentText"><p>His impact also went way beyond his shooting splits, he got us looking like an actual basketball team again with his pkaymaking abilities.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s obviously tough to evaluate players on terrible teams, especially in the second half of the season where all hope is already lost, but he definitely made a big impact that went way beyond box score stats. It also seemed to me like he was way out of rhythm due to not seeing the floor enough in OKC, his shooting got progressively better with us, so I&rsquo;m fairly optimistic that his TS% will keep on improving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to come from being option number one in Europe to being a role player in the NBA, it&rsquo;s a huge change in both play style and responsibilities. Especially with his playing time being so inconstent with the Thunder.</p>

      <label for="latybl8" class="commentText"><p>I think whoever it is in the future they have to go through the NA college level to reach the NBA. Coming in  from Europe is much harder. Though I doubt it will be anytime soon as our country doesn&rsquo;t really have a good system to produce basketball players and height and athleticism are severely lacking.</p>

      <label for="lau6sd9" class="commentText"><p>I am not buying this.  Back to back years the #1 pick is out of Europe.  Three of the top 10 this are Euros.  US’s AAU is failing its athletes because there is less emphasis on team play and more emphasis on individually getting to the next level.  Europe is deeply rooted in learning the basics first at a young age.  This is why these young players can come over and contribute immediately.</p>

<p>Have any of you watched an NBA game recently? The impact of European players is on display every moment of every game…</p>

<p>The Spurs style of play during their last dance/revenge tour opened the door for the Warriors. The entire league plays at tempo with movement that resembles European footy. Their lasting impact is visible all over the court and it’s truly made basketball a global game.</p>

      <label for="laub0x4" class="commentText"><p>You have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. Have you watched any Euroleague games? The emphasis isn&rsquo;t on the individual. In the NBA the players take the shot they can hit at a high percentage. In Europe the goal is for the team to find the most efficient shot. The europeans that play well in the NBA are all great individuals. You are right that some philosophies from european basketball are used in the NBA but US basketball still is the strongest.</p>

<p>That’s you. I wasn’t comparing whether Europe is stronger than the United States in basketball, that’s ludicrous…</p>

<p>Ignoring the massive impact European players have had on the NBA in the last 25 years is as well.</p>

      <label for="latye77" class="commentText"><p>The issue isnt exactly playing time so much as their roles.</p>

<p>In Europe these guys are the superstars that lead their teams. Telling a superstar to transition into a roleplayer in their prime isnt exactly easy, especially if their claim tk fame is their ability to run an offense.</p>

<p>Luka could have very easily been the same had the Mavs not given him the keys to the franchise.</p>

<p>Hell a good reason a lot of players fail in the NBA in general is just the role they are given. The Magic tried to make AG their main star and that didnt work, but he is a perfect roleplayer for Jokic. It goes both ways, though it feels like a lot of these top end European guys either need to be the focus of their team or they just arent gonna work in the NBA.</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t realize why Vezenkov was so successful in Europe. He was able to make a lot of good decisions on the court consistently. He knew how/when to pass, when to cut, when to shoot. He wasn&rsquo;t the strongest or fastest guy there either but his decision making was top tier.</p>

<p>Leaving him in the corner to shoot threes takes away his biggest strength. Alot of guys can be better at this role than Vezenkov.</p>

<p>He had some great flashes but for the most part was below average. I do think he had some bad luck with injuries and without them, he might&rsquo;ve had a better chance of being able to show what he could do. But I don&rsquo;t really see how you can blame the Kings for that part.</p>

<p>I think Toronto could probably flip Vezenkov to a contender looking to bolster their bench (like Denver) if Vezenkov decides to stay in the NBA.</p>

He continued to park himself in the corner and shoot 3s , or rotate around the perimeter and shoot 3s. I barely saw him attack the rim. Maybe that was due to his lack of athleticism but then you have to ask yourself how he was such a prolific scorer in Europe.</p>

<p>Makes you wonder how a pure shooter like Sam Merrill would do overseas if guys like Veznekov win MVP and a path to the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lau0054" class="commentText"><p>Merrill would probably do very well in europe.</p>

<p>You must realise like 90% of the game in europe is set plays. They have far far more practive time due to how many less games they have so thats feasable. Everything revolves around getting that easy open shot as the spacing is a lot worse due to Fiba rules.</p>

<p>I think people really underestimate the difference between the rulesets and how they change the game. Also stats really dont transfer perfectly. Like Lukas 3p% jumped 5% his first year compared to playing in spain but his FG% dropped 3%.</p>
