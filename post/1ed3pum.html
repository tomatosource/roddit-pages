      <label for="lf4g7xc" class="commentText"><p>Likely extend Lauri, and Tank. Jazz even with Lauri are at best the 13th seed, and that&rsquo;s with Portland, and maybe the Clippers being worse (if Kawhi gets injured). Only way Jazz aren&rsquo;t a bottom 3 seed in the west is if 3 playoff teams best player gets a season ending injury in the first month of the season. Then in the east Jazz are probably better than the Nets, and maybe Pistons. So likely the Jazz are guaranteed being a bottom 5 team in the league, so the Jazz can tank with Lauri this season, then see what happens in the draft. To see what direction they go next. If they get Cooper or a top 5 pick, trade for a star with the picks they got from the Cavs, and Wolves to have a Cooper, Lauri, and other star big 3, if they fall below 5, then trade Lauri, who&rsquo;d have solid value as his extension would start the season after thos</p>

Of course he has value if he refuses to extend.  It’ll remain the same as it is right now and slowly dwindle as the season progresses.  The Raptors played this game and got a pretty meh return for Siakam and I’d argue he is more proven asset.</p>

      <label for="lf4y5pd" class="commentText"><p>Well the rumor is they’re not waiting for the deadline and are going to extend him come August 6th. That is the discussion we’re having.  If you’re arguing he’ll have the same value at the deadline… I disagree.  He will have missed nearly half the season for said team.  That has value and Utah will have had him on their team for half a season damaging their lottery status.  They’re in a pickle for sure and extending him on August 6th is the worst outcome for them if they’re trying to move him between now and the deadline.  The bidders will be far less once his extension is inked simply because the shear volume of teams with contracts that are movable at that new number will dip.</p>

<p>Lauri on his current deal at the deadline 100% has less value than he does now, in that we agree. I don’t think Lauri on a long term deal at the deadline has value much different to now. </p>

<p>That said, I don’t think either of the above are likely. He’ll be traded before August 6th or be on the Jazz until next off season imo. </p>

<p>Now not every team will be able to afford him and maybe your team is one of those teams. IDK</p>

<p>But his value does not go down with a 5 year max contract, especially if he’s not even demanding out of Utah</p>

<p>His current deal is only for one more season.</p>

<p>Thus every team knows he’ll need a massive deal, whether it’s given to him by Utah prior to a trade or by them after acquiring him</p>

<p>So I can’t see how his value goes down in any way due to a new massive extension unless his actual play on the court regresses</p>

      <label for="lf4xdle" class="commentText"><p>You’re completely ignoring the money game. The stars are making so much more than most that it becomes a hilarious exercise of who you can add up for a trade.  It’s far more enticing for teams to trade more draft equity than players right now because his salary is easy to match right now.  The moment he is rolling with a max, they’re less likely to get all that draft equity because the salary alone will typically mean most teams will have to throw a massive salary back.  Once you start doing the math you quickly realize the value just isn’t there.  You’re going to have to gut a squad to acquire a player and be expected to include draft capital.</p>

      <label for="lf4xv6z" class="commentText"><p>Your point would hold up if he had MULTIPLE (2-3 years) left on his value contract, he doesn’t. He gets paid big starting in the the 2025-2026 season whether it’s by Utah in an extension Thai summer or by the team that trades for him. The team that trades for him is trading for him as a STAR on their team for the next 4-6 years. If you’re thinking the Warriors(or any team) are going to get him in some kind of a bargain trade package, you’re out of touch. If he’s moved at all, it’ll be for something similar to the Mitchell deal from two years ago or the Bridges deal from this summer.</p>

<p>And even if he extends with Utah this summer, the huge money doesn’t kick in until 2025-2026 anyways, so in terms of salary matching they’d still have from extension through the trade deadline to extract the right deal for them from a team that maybe prefers to send out minimal salary based more on his current final year of his deal</p>

      <label for="lf4yx1a" class="commentText"><p>You’re not understanding how difficult it is to trade now from a salary matching standpoint. Right now, it only takes a role player and a lottery picks rookie contract.  After that, it’ll be a hell of a lot more. I’m not saying he’s not worth the money. I’m saying as soon as the number is larger the number of teams who can trade for him will fall dramatically.  The new rules make trading star contracts very difficult due to the salary matching requirements and the impacts of the luxury tax aprons.</p>

<p>He will definitely not be a low value contract… the bigger issue is Utah will be less likely to find a trade deal partner that will be willing to dump whatever near max contract they need to match with as they probably value that player as well.  A 1 for 1 swap plus draft equity isn’t going to be as enticing as being able to throw some young lottery pick with potential + salary filler + draft equity.  The moment it becomes more 1 for 1 the less appealing it becomes to throw in draft equity which is what Utah is clearly valuing.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons I’ve seen for not adding Podz or Kuminga is that the Dubs would be bidding against themselves and some the Jazz <em>need</em> to trade Lauri, they will eventually lower their demands and take the Warriors offer. This report implies that isn’t the case.</p>

<p>Refusing to trade your players for less than you think they’re worth isn’t stubborn, that’s just competency in a GM. Unless they’re asking out or threatening to walk, neither of which is the case here. </p>

<p>which is somewhere a lot of warriors fans know so much about as the warriors franchise was stuck in &ldquo;no man&rsquo;s land&rdquo; for much of their early 2000s teams when they won 38, 37, 34, &amp; 34 games from <sup>2002</sup>&frasl;<sub>03</sub> thru <sup>2005</sup>&frasl;<sub>06</sub> while their draft positioning was 11th, 11th, 9th, &amp; 9th and selected the likes of pietrus, biedrins, diogu &amp; o&rsquo;bryant</p>

<p>jazz the last two seasons have won 37 and 31 games &amp; picked 9th and 10th in the draft &hellip; and selected hendriks &amp; williams who like those warriors players probably project at best as role players but none are franchise changers in the NBA realistically</p>

<p>jazz like the warriors aren&rsquo;t good enough to be a contender let alone a playoff team but also not bad enough to be at the top of the draft lottery odds</p>

<p>now warriors got lucky in 2009 with curry who was picked 7th &amp; is an all time great but odds of that happening picking in the late top 10 or late lottery isn&rsquo;t something i&rsquo;d rely on or hope for as an NBA front office</p>

<p>or hope the draft lottery gods smile in your favor if &amp; when there are elite NBA draft prospects like many believe there will be in these next upcoming drafts in 2025 or 2026</p>

<li>The West is absolutely filthy stacked. If they were in the East, the Jazz with Markkanen (and Hardy, who&rsquo;s an amazing coach) might find a way to &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; get 30 wins. The West is so stacked that they might be trying to win every game and still only win 25 games.</li>
<li>As the other commenter said, the Jazz have loads of picks coming in from CLE and MIN. They could keep them or use them to trade up</li>
<li>Danny could always extend in August + trade Markkanen at the trade deadline if a team gets really desperate (like, if the Warriors are hovering at the <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> seed and want to make a serious playoff push)</li>
</ul>

      <label for="lf4wzu1" class="commentText"><p>So&hellip;.basically everything Jazz beat writers have been saying this entire time.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve been consistent and it seems like folks are looking for a reason to try to trade Lauri out of Utah and trying to conjure him out and pressure campaign him out in a similar albeit not quite as focused way as we saw with Beal all those years. It was almost like trying to talk their way into a deal then, and it feels that way here. We see that a lot with high level players in markets that are deemed second class.</p>

<p>Jazz beat writers have been consistent that it would take a home run for Lauri to be moved, that he isn&rsquo;t on the market, and that while Jazz brass are listening to offers, they&rsquo;re doing it more as inquiries to see if a team is willing to hit that home run, not in actually shopping Lauri. He&rsquo;s not being shopped. A team would have to convince the Jazz to move him. The Kings went with DeMar, the Lakers seem to be shopping at a lower market, and if we are to believe Draymond, the Warriors have backed off their pursuit of Lauri. If that&rsquo;s the case then it is indeed unlikely he goes anywhere.</p>

<p>Spurs are a team that&rsquo;s a dark horse but they haven&rsquo;t been willing to put their chips on the table and seem doubtful to be willing to. As far as the Jazz plans, expect them to sign some veterans to flesh out their roster, they have three open roster spots, and I am going to assume they take a similar tact to the last few years, putting a competitive outfit on the floor and seeing where they are around deadline time&hellip;it looks probable at this point Collins and Clarkson start the season with the Jazz.</p>

      <label for="lf4ya3h" class="commentText"><p>Sure that&rsquo;s pretty much what I said on my edit. If we were holding out for 2 unprotected 29 and 31 Lakers firsts we are obviously asking a lot for Grant.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t know what firsts you have, they don&rsquo;t all have the same value obv.</p>

      <label for="lf4ysgw" class="commentText"><p>True. For what it&rsquo;s worth I think a decent pick and a prospect of Moody&rsquo;s caliber (from what I&rsquo;ve seen of him) is probably close to fair value for Grant. But as I said I don&rsquo;t think we would be interested in Moody for positional reasons and we would obviously start our asking price high and could be negotiated down re: picks</p>

      <label for="lf4z2vi" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough. You definitely would know more about your roster and needs so that makes sense, I think Podz/Kuminga are probably both no-gos for Grant though. Maybe Kuminga but without any draft capital</p>

      <label for="lf4zebu" class="commentText"><p>I kinda thought you guys might want to move off of Kuminga before his next contract, but that definitely makes more sense for Lauri who is younger than Grant. I suppose this is why all trades are ultimately unlikely, both sides want to win the deal lol 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
