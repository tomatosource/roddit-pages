<p>He was 88% that night on 32 attempts lol. The <sup>36</sup>&frasl;<sub>63</sub> from the field makes complete sense considering he was much bigger than everyone else, but that free throw stat is insane to me lol. He shot underhanded that night.</p>

After this game he went back to regular shooting for FTs and sucked. There is a whole Malcolm gladwell podcast about it. He couldn’t deal w being made fun of for shooting granny style even though it made him infinitely better. Peer pressure is weird man.</p>

<p>Rick Barry wouldn&rsquo;t join the league for another 3 years.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No he didn&rsquo;t. He would still shoot underhanded FTs until at least 1967, if not later. He tried various forms, but he was bad with all of them.</p>

<p>Between him and Russell, Wilt was the one who cared about how people perceived him throughout his entire career, on and off the court.</p>

<p>Not to mention the chip on his shoulder from all the losses he suffered at the hands of the Celtics.</p>

<p>It makes sense that he would give up on granny shooting, knowing how horrible the media were back then, they probably talked mad shit about how someone like him had to use the granny tech for free throws.</p>

The combination was just a complete outlier.</p>

<p>Some of that applies to Wembanyama now. He&rsquo;s not the only guy his height in pro basketball. But the combination of that with his length, mind, skillset, and coordination is just an outlier.</p>

      <label for="lggdmsk" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re both right.</p>

<p>In a documentary about Russell, he goes on to talk about how his kinship with Wilt was used as a means to soften him up during games, so that Wilt wouldn&rsquo;t go so hard on Russell. He goes into that famous cackle of his, while he talks about it too.</p>

<p>The courtesy also extended both ways. Russell was a bit softer on Wilt too, to ensure he wouldn&rsquo;t get too competitive during their games and Bill would actively defend Wilt in on-court conflicts.</p>

<p>It was tactical for sure, but they loved each other and it showed on the court.</p>

      <label for="lggal1p" class="commentText"><p>Excellent point. The ultimate uneducated take is to just say wilt was taller lol. The average height of the league was marginally different than today especially considering we went through an era starting in the 70s where they lied about their height or measured with shoes on for official measurements. Wilt would be taller than everyone in any NBA cuz he was AT LEAST 7&rsquo;1 with one of the better verticals in the NBA. Not to mention he had a ridiculous motor, and is probably one of the all-time fastest tall people of all time.</p>

I know the old articles said he was 7&rsquo;1&rdquo; in his socks, but I thought it was just exaggerating until I saw him next to Shaq and realized Wilt was indeed actually a tiny bit taller. Combine that with his shoulders being higher and broader than Shaq&rsquo;s, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe that freak was unleashed on basketball in the 1950&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>First, the team heavy style those Celtics played have it hard to claim anyone was a first option. Second, he was their best player, but that was heavily for being arguably the greatest defensive presence in league history while having immense supporting impact with passing, especially outlet passing, and creating extra possessions on the boards. He was much more of a utility type offensively to amplify their other scoring threats like Havlicek, Heinsohn, Sam Jones, etc</p>

<p>I’m not sure if Russell ever led the Celtics in scoring, and very often he wasn’t even top-3</p>

The people at his time hadn&rsquo;t played their whole lives with a 24 second shot clock. So, the pace was crazy and everyone was throwing up lower quality shots. That is where his main skills of rebounding (due to many shots) and rim protection (due to it being the most efficient shot) made him the most useful player of that era. Plus, 5 MVPs given by his peers and 11 rings cannot be an accident.</p>

      <label for="lgg3m8e" class="commentText"><p>True. But it also was the best season of his career from the free throw line at 61%. He shot 58% his rookie year. He became progressively worse throughout his career, which seems so weird.</p>

<p>How many of those would he have needed to win to be the goat? If we looked back at 50ppg, 40ppg seasons on top of all the other records <strong>AND</strong> he had 5 rings I dont see how you could even make an argument for anyone else lmao.</p>

<p>Respect to Wilt for keeping goat chat fun</p>

      <label for="lgg3z1b" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s getting tougher with each passing year, but <a href="https://www.therecordherald.com/story/sports/nba/2016/03/02/pro-basketball-bob-stum-witnessed/32451867007/" target="_blank">yes, there&rsquo;s some detailed accounts out there</a>. They&rsquo;re actually pretty interesting to read when you stumble across them.</p>

<p>That said, yeah, since it occurred in 1962, assuming Stum (the person from the account linked above) was 22 or so at the time, that&rsquo;d mean he&rsquo;d be about 84 years old now (mid-seventies when article was originally published). He was probably an ideal candidate for a re-tell in the 2010s, since he was old enough and knowledgeable enough of basketball in 1962 to fully understand the context but young enough to, you know, still be alive in the 2010s.</p>
