<p>He was 88% that night on 32 attempts lol. The <sup>36</sup>&frasl;<sub>63</sub> from the field makes complete sense considering he was much bigger than everyone else, but that free throw stat is insane to me lol. He shot underhanded that night.</p>

<p>the made part is important. he took a lot of shots, but that doesn&rsquo;t help with the FT&rsquo;s being made. Shaq had a game like that  (his birthday game?).</p>

<p>still silly the random stats Wilt has.</p>

      <label for="lgi71jl" class="commentText"><p>agreed, but that is where his career average comes in. if he shot that percentage, he&rsquo;d have to have taken 50-60 FTs to equal the points. that would have made the biggest foul bater you can think of blush at how bad that would be.</p>

<p>that he was such a bad FT shooter and made that many is what this was about</p>

The combination was just a complete outlier.</p>

<p>Some of that applies to Wembanyama now. He&rsquo;s not the only guy his height in pro basketball. But the combination of that with his length, mind, skillset, and coordination is just an outlier.</p>

<p>In a documentary about Russell, he goes on to talk about how his kinship with Wilt was used as a means to soften Wilt up during games, so that Wilt wouldn&rsquo;t go so hard on Russell. He goes into that famous cackle of his, while he talks about it too.</p>

<p>The courtesy also extended both ways. Russell was a bit softer on Wilt too, to ensure Wilt wouldn&rsquo;t get too competitive during their games and Bill would actively defend Wilt in on-court conflicts.</p>

<p>It was tactical for sure, but they loved each other and it showed on the court.</p>

      <label for="lgik6i0" class="commentText"><p>Wilt cared about his stats, but this narrative that he would sabotage the team by caring about stats is bs. It&rsquo;s crazy when you look at how many times they almost beat Boston and it&rsquo;s crazy to ignore the fact that no one except Wilt ever beat Boston</p>

      <label for="lghwp55" class="commentText"><p>That is just Boston area narrative, that then became nba lore, due to the media liking lazy narratives.
The reality was simple, Russell&rsquo;s team mates were just outright better than Wilts for the majority of both their careers. One dude played with HOF coming off the bench, and the other guy had mostly 2 or sometimes 3 other great players alongside him. The Celtics in those days, out talented the whole league by a wide margin and that is why they won</p>

<p>I think wemby’s def more skilled but that’s a lot due to the fact that the sport has evolved so much.</p>

<p>It’s really a testament to how talented he is to garner wilt comparisons.</p>

      <label for="lggo7nt" class="commentText"><p>He definitely will improve. But wilt was just different man. Like his strength is legendary. Bro out-lifted Arnold. I know Arnies a bodybuilder and is much smaller but that’s insanely impressive. He was dense too. Wembys probably going to fill out but I dont think he will ever be considered jacked.</p>

<p>I doubt wemby will ever be stronger than someone like Embiid but Wilt was supposedly even stronger than Shaq. I’ll never forget him big brother-ing shaq by shaking his hand super hard.</p>

<p>You’re right though. Wemby is going to be a problem. Not that he isn’t already.</p>

The average height of the league was marginally different than today especially considering we went through an era starting in the 70s where they lied about their height or measured with shoes on for official measurements. Wilt would be taller than everyone in any NBA cuz he was AT LEAST 7&rsquo;1 with one of the better verticals in the NBA. Not to mention he had a ridiculous motor, and is probably one of the all-time fastest tall people of all time.</p>

I know the old articles said he was 7&rsquo;1&rdquo; in his socks, but I thought it was just exaggerating until I saw him next to Shaq and realized Wilt was indeed actually a tiny bit taller. Combine that with his shoulders being higher and broader than Shaq&rsquo;s, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe that freak was unleashed on basketball in the 1950&rsquo;s.</p>

<p> Wilt had longer lenght by a bit i think, longer legs which helped with mobility in non straight line (most useful for defense) and probably more upper body strenght  </p>

<p>Some good quotes from the movie shooting too from Arnold about Wilt’s insane strength:</p>

<p>“In one instance, Andre and Wilt, as Arnold recalled, “were joking about who could pick me up and make me look lighter and like a little fly.””</p>

<p>“Taken aback, Arnold exclaimed, “He [Wilt] lifted me up with one hard like nothing.””</p>

<p>“Praising his strength, Arnie said, “he was the only basketball player in those days I saw working out with weights. He did triceps extensions with 180 pounds, which blew us all away.” ”</p>

<p>Rick Barry wouldn&rsquo;t join the league for another 3 years.</p>

<p>No he didn&rsquo;t. He would still shoot underhanded FTs until at least 1967, if not later. He tried various forms, but he was bad with all of them.</p>

IF you think about it, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense: you have to have two different shots, your regular overhand shot in the game, and your free throw shot. It&rsquo;s harder to master two totally different sets of mechanics. In fact, there was a study done and it found no advantage to underhand shooting.</p>

<p>Shooting underhanded is easier to figure out and is easier to master, Steve Nash has talked about this and said that while he thinks is awkward to have the ball coming from below, he sees how it can remove some of the inconsistencies of the shot. Shooting FTs is all about being consistent with your form and having good form, two things that bad free throw shooters don&rsquo;t have.</p>

      <label for="lgh1412" class="commentText"><p>Yes, your anecdote is so much more convincing than actual data.</p>

<p>As for your arguments, when shooting underhand you introduce more points of contact with the ball, and so more points of potential error. You have to keep your mechanics correct on two arms, not one, which introduces more potential error, and &ndash; as you said &ndash; it&rsquo;s a lot about consistency and it is much harder to do that with multiple shooting forms than with one. Hence, if anything, underhand is likely to make you shoot worse.</p>

Just like with widening the lane and offensive goaltending, Wilt was the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back but it was also something that would&rsquo;ve probably been changed at some point or another.</p>

      <label for="lgk118d" class="commentText"><p>IIRC the story was that they would throw alleyoops/shots to Wilt and he would grab the ball in spots that would be considered inside the cylinder. I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw him grabbing shots off the rim like that, though. I could be mistaken, because that last time I looked into it was probably a decade ago. I&rsquo;m just going off memory so it&rsquo;s definitely possible.</p>

<p>I also feel like some of the blocks I&rsquo;ve seen from him back in the day may have been considered goaltending under modern standards. Again, though, it&rsquo;s been a while since I looked into it so I could be misremembering.</p>

<p>A lot of stuff like this also came from Wilt himself, and he was known for being quite the embellisher at times. There&rsquo;s not really much, if any, footage available from that era to really verify things one way or another. So, we&rsquo;re just kind of left to take the word of people who lived at the time and draw our own conclusions.</p>

<p>Between him and Russell, Wilt was the one who cared about how people perceived him throughout his entire career, on and off the court.</p>

<p>Not to mention the chip on his shoulder from all the losses he suffered at the hands of the Celtics.</p>

<p>It makes sense that he would give up on granny shooting, knowing how horrible the media were back then, they probably talked mad shit about how someone like him had to use the granny tech for free throws.</p>

<p>The infamous &lsquo;no left hand&rsquo; affected his mentality so much that it led to him honing in on that aspect of his gameplay and improving massively. None of that would have happened if he didn&rsquo;t take that criticism to heart.</p>

<p>Also KD and his famous twitter beefs. This guy has been one of the best players for years. Has rings, finals MVPs, a league MVP you name it and he probably has it. But this guy with all these accolades, still cares about twitter shit talking him.</p>

<p>There have always been players who care about the public perception of them, throughout the entirety of nba and sports at large. Just as there have been players who couldn&rsquo;t give a shit/don&rsquo;t really care. Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, Dennis Rodman etc</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just human nature that some players care too much while others couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>

      <label for="lghi339" class="commentText"><p>I spoke of certain players responding to a public perception of them. I never used the term &lsquo;peer pressured&rsquo; myself. I dislike it for conversations such as this.</p>

<p>For me personally it doesn&rsquo;t apply because more often than not, criticisms chucked at players come from commentators, journalists and in the modern day, twitter trolls, most of whom are not actually peers of the pro players.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&rsquo;t consider JB to have been peer pressured. But I will say that the public perception that existed of him being a &ldquo;one handed player&rdquo; was definitely a catalyst that caused him to work much much harder on improving his left-handed gameplay.</p>

<p>Like how Kobe had built up a negative perception of himself due to his hero ball tendencies, but later on changed his playstyle to become more team-focused.</p>

<p>Both had a social stigma attached to them and both worked to correct that aspect, not just because of the social stigma but also because it was a necessary improvement for them to continue playing at the highest level.</p>

      <label for="lgg299y" class="commentText"><p>Bill Russell wasn’t a first option though?</p>

<p>First, the team heavy style those Celtics played have it hard to claim anyone was a first option. Second, he was their best player, but that was heavily for being arguably the greatest defensive presence in league history while having immense supporting impact with passing, especially outlet passing, and creating extra possessions on the boards. He was much more of a utility type offensively to amplify their other scoring threats like Havlicek, Heinsohn, Sam Jones, etc</p>

<p>I’m not sure if Russell ever led the Celtics in scoring, and very often he wasn’t even top-3</p>

There are a lot of liars who try to claim they were there when the game happened, but the amount of credible people who were present when it took place; players, coaching staff etc leans into the game being real and not some hoax. Bill Campbell, a longtime sportscaster and legend, who announced the match himself, often talked about it during his career.</p>

<p>While there may not be footage, there is the 4th quarter recording which has since been added to the USA&rsquo;s national registry for preservation.</p>

<p>I can understand that there being no footage makes it easy to doubt the game ever really took place, but for me personally, there&rsquo;s too much evidence to dismiss the game.</p>

<p>Russell&rsquo;s 11 rings:</p>

<p>In regards to the Celtic dynasty of the 60s, their legacy is a victim of it&rsquo;s own success. A lot of people like yourself, want to give reasons as to why their dynasty shouldn&rsquo;t be held in high regard and I do understand the argument, &lsquo;how good was the league really, if they won 8 rings in a row?&rsquo;</p>

<p>What you have to consider is that a lot of the arguments that can be used against them, can also be used in their favour as well. The Celtics had the best team, we all accept this as truth, but they had to compete against players who have gone down in history as legends; Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Bob Pettit, Oscar Robertson, Hal Greer, Richie Guerin and the list goes on.</p>

<p>While you are correct in mentioning the lower number of teams the league had, it also works against you in that the spread of high quality players is much lower than in the modern day. Less teams means more groupings of high quality players, that is a different measure of competition compared to the modern day NBA. And when you speak of groupings of high quality players, the dynasty Celtics are the peak of that.</p>

<p>Okay but they had the best coach in the league! Well yeah true, but that speaks volumes about how important good coaching is to any team. Red was an absolute master tactician and there isn&rsquo;t a brain alive who could view basketball the way he did, and that was back then without modern day analytics or technology. Red&rsquo;s knowledge of the game is such that when he retired, Russell player-coached the Celtics to 2 more rings using what he had learnt from his longtime manager. And in the modern day, so many NBA winning teams and their coaches can all trace their tactics back, one way or another, to the team-first tactics of Red&rsquo;s Celtics.</p>

<p>Trying to downplay the Russell era Celtics is like trying to downplay Rocky Marciano, the Brazil team of 1970 or the 1927 Murderers Row Yankees. All of these examples are held in such high regard because they were head and shoulders above all competition, not because the competition was lacking but by virtue of their ability and achievements.</p>

The people at his time hadn&rsquo;t played their whole lives with a 24 second shot clock. So, the pace was crazy and everyone was throwing up lower quality shots. That is where his main skills of rebounding (due to many shots) and rim protection (due to it being the most efficient shot) made him the most useful player of that era. Plus, 5 MVPs given by his peers and 11 rings cannot be an accident.</p>

<p>His career TS% was just below league average, and it was even worse when you consider that he was a Center. Nowadays star players who are league average efficiency are considered to be inefficient chuckers.</p>

      <label for="lgguh7a" class="commentText"><p>To all the morons who think Wilt didn&rsquo;t actually score 100 points, do you really think every reputable news outlet covering the event would &ldquo;lie&rdquo; about it? You really think nobody would go to the press and say &ldquo;hey, he didn&rsquo;t actually score 100 points&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Like you can literally go back and find articles from March 3rd, 1962 talking about the game. At this point anyone denying it is just a pseudo-intellectual jumping on lazy narratives.</p>

<p>This was in the era when goal tending and basket interference was different. Everyone was throwing it to wilt and he was just grabbing the ball cause he indeed was trying to get as much points as possible. The team realised it and they kept feeding him in the end.</p>

<p>This is not due to him being bigger than anyone else. </p>

They&rsquo;re actually pretty interesting to read when you stumble across them.</p>

<p>That said, yeah, since it occurred in 1962, assuming Stum (the person from the account linked above) was 22 or so at the time, that&rsquo;d mean he&rsquo;d be about 84 years old now (mid-seventies when article was originally published). He was probably an ideal candidate for a re-tell in the 2010s, since he was old enough and knowledgeable enough of basketball in 1962 to fully understand the context but young enough to, you know, still be alive in the 2010s.</p>
