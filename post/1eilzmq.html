      <p>Full Article (Paywall): <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/40698205/how-jalen-brunson-extension-deal-affects-new-york-knicks-julius-randle-nba-cba" target="_blank">https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/40698205/how-jalen-brunson-extension-deal-affects-new-york-knicks-julius-randle-nba-cba</a></p>

<p>“In the wake of Brunson&rsquo;s decision [to extend], there were two questions NBA team executives and agents posed for both New York and the league:</p>

<p>Will Brunson&rsquo;s extension decision start a trend of stars prioritizing roster building at the cost of significant finances in response to both the rapidly rising salary cap and the stringent apron rules in the league&rsquo;s new collective bargaining agreement?</p>

<p>And what does Brunson&rsquo;s new deal mean for Julius Randle, who on Saturday becomes eligible to sign a lucrative extension &ndash; and whose upcoming negotiations in New York, team executives told ESPN, will be the ultimate case study under the CBA?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he Jalen Brunson?&rdquo; one Western Conference executive told ESPN when commenting if Randle would be willing to compromise on his next contract, &ldquo;or Paul George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The money available to re-sign your own players is so great, but the apron rules are so prohibitive, one Eastern Conference executive told ESPN: &ldquo;There has to be a balance on how a team can remain competitive but also reward a player financially.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lg7ngzw" class="commentText"><p>Exactly.  Brunson did what he felt was the right choice in locking in money now while having the opportunity to hit free agency the year he&rsquo;s eligible for a 35% supermax.  Randle&rsquo;s already at 10+ years of service, so it&rsquo;s a different situation for him.</p>

      <label for="lg7vnuj" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a tough situation for both sides to guage a fair contract.  He&rsquo;s played his best ball the past 2 years and made the All-Star team twice.  On the other hand, he&rsquo;s going into his age 30 season coming off shoulder surgery.  It would not surprise me if he ends up going to free agency next year to give both sides a chance to figure out his value.  I would be seriously shocked if the Knicks gave him a max or anything close to it at this time.</p>

<p>That part’s irrelevant, he could’ve waited a year and just done the same length with way more AAV. It’s more just him hedging against a IT/Rose injury in this year and loses everything.</p>

      <label for="lg8k1jg" class="commentText"><p>It doesn&rsquo;t even make sense to consider it &ldquo;taking one for the team&rdquo; though. Brunson is a sub 6 ft guard who just suffered his first major injury. The BIG contract everyone is saying he&rsquo;s supposed to get would&rsquo;ve come after another year of playing at his current level post injury recovery and is also contingent on him not getting injured again at any point during next season. He took the smaller extension because it diminishes that risk for him. If he&rsquo;s out or heavily declined due to injury now, Knicks will HAVE to pay him 156M anyway. He took the safer option instead of making a gamble. It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s taking less than the maximum possible exception that was allowed after last season.</p>

I still think it&rsquo;s something people will praise. Brunson has gotta be top5 most popular players rn. Humble underdog story, playing for his hometown AND took a paycut. Y’all deserve it after Melo - not that he was the awfull, or anything, just that he wasn’t the messaiah new yorkers wanted him to be</p>

<p>Guys can be plenty dedicated and still expect to be paid for what they’re worth I think. In fact, the dedication to relentless practice to get really good (and then going on to actually become really good) only serves to reinforce that he should be properly compensated.</p>

<p>Brunson’s case is super helpful for the Knicks, but there’s a reason it’s rare to see.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Calling it a &ldquo;pay cut&rdquo; is a disingenuous way of putting it especially considering he will get more money regardless. Do you really believe Randle deserves a max contract that basically ties up 30% of a teams cap? And if he doesn&rsquo;t get that is it a pay cut? Or is it just teams are smarter about what they pay offense first players who don&rsquo;t scale up in the playoffs?</p>

<p>Randle is exactly the type of player who should be paid less in the new CBA, there is no reason to come close to paying him a max</p>

      <label for="lgabz9b" class="commentText"><p>I never said anything about whether Randle deserves the contract or not. All I’m saying is that if the Knicks offer him the contract, there’s no reason he should feel the need to take a paycut. He averaged 24/9/5 before his shoulder injury last season and the Knicks were winning. He’s a very good player, despite what r/nba wants you to believe.</p>

      <label for="lg7xu0b" class="commentText"><p>Jalen Brunson took a risky deal so that when it comes to his next contract he can make absolute bank, and he felt he was in a safe enough position because of his family ties with the organization and the idea that if he leads the team to the promised land it will result him in being essentially the king of New York.</p>

<p>Randle has been the best player for the Knicks over the last decade (besides Jalen but he’s also been here longer and took us from bad to good) and every season he gets absolutely disrespected from the media and Knicks fans alike. Also he’s already at the 10 year vet level. He’s in a completely different situation and should absolutely take the money</p>

<p>If no extension is signed we go into next off season when Randle tests the marker(eligible for some absurd 324 mil deal). At the point, the Knicks do not have to pay him that. If another team wants to pay him or that or anywhere close great that team can have him, but likely no one will be willing to sign Randle to a contract anywhere near that number, so the Knicks will likely be able to sign him for much less. I really just don’t understand the concept of “having to pay ur players the max” that’s only an issue if other teams r willing to pay.</p>

<p>You can just as easily flip that argument by bringing up what OG is making.</p>

The market for elite 3&amp;D wings is much stronger than a player like Randle as well. Randle is a solid player but he’s nowhere near a max level player. He should not expect the Knicks to offer max money.</p>

      <label for="lg7nj78" class="commentText"><p>Ok? Og makes about 5 mil more per year than Brunson. However Brunson extension kicks in a year later(idk if this important) so difference between first year of each then second year and so on is about 2 mil. Point is Og is only making so much more due to that fifth year. I’d randle takes a similar contract to Og thatd also be chill since it’s similar AAV</p>

      <label for="lg7od5n" class="commentText"><p>But the point still remains. The argument &ldquo;this is what Brunson makes, we&rsquo;re paying you that&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really make sense when Brunson isn&rsquo;t actually the highest paid guy on the team. Unlike say, the contract PG wanted from the Clippers where he wanted the same thing Kawhi got cause he shouldn&rsquo;t make more than Kawhi.</p>

<p>If he makes the same as OG got, that&rsquo;s cool. But we&rsquo;re talking very small amounts under the max, which still isn&rsquo;t down with what Brunson got.</p>

My argument is that Idt we should be paying Randle 45 mil a year (I think about 40 a year is fine maybe a bit over). Ik the difference is pretty small there tbh if he signs the extension I’m cool w it. What i don’t understand is the idea that if we don’t extend him we’ll have to pay him 4 years 320 mil next summer to keep him, that’s the main part of my original post I stand by</p>

With that said, Randle has been mentioned in trade talks for the last 2 years so I think it&rsquo;s dumb for him to take less unless they give a no trade&hellip;which I doubt they would for him.  Don&rsquo;t cut the team a break because you know they will ship you out as soon as something better comes along</p>

<p>But the Knicks should take a beat before offering the max imo. Randle at his 21, 23, and 24 levels of play is absolutely worth that money <em>but</em> he’s coming off ankle and shoulder surgeries in the last 2 years, and the Knicks highest ceiling might be upgrading at C and then running Brunson/DDV/Bridges/OG 1-4.</p>

<p>This is gonna be an interesting negotiation. I genuinely believe he has very little value around the league. I just can’t imagine any team wanting to sign this guy to a max or near max contract. No rational front office would want him as their best, second best, or even 3rd best player and his skill set doesn’t lend itself to playing a role either. He’s gotta be one of the toughest guys in the league to value because he puts up big numbers but you wouldn’t want him on your team.</p>

<p>Siakam is under contract at a little under <span class="math inline">\(50 million per year ages 30-33. Randle would be under contract for \)</span>60 million per year ages 31-35.</p>

<p>Siakam is a more efficient player, better defender, won’t be as old, and is a way better playoff performer. Please be my guest and give Randle 35% of the cap. His 34% field goal percentage and negative defense in the playoffs will ensure you won’t be contending for the next 6 years because no one will take that contract once signed and it will push the Knicks over the second apron</p>

<p>Well he sucks at shooting so that’s probably true. But if he was ever gonna be a good complimentary player, you’d want him to be able to space the floor. He’s not a good enough to be a primary offensive engine so you’d want him to be good off ball in order to contribute as a 3rd or 4th option.</p>

<p>The guy is 29 and has a horrific playoff resume. The fact that he barely ever made it is a reflection of how little he contributes to winning in the first place.</p>

<p>2 threes a game from a guy who plays in the paint is a guy who can space the floor. Would you rather he shoots 8 threes a game at 34% like he did the year before? If you would actually read the articles I linked (which you won&rsquo;t) you&rsquo;d see how his game has shifted over the course of his time in New York and how he&rsquo;s doing all the things people have asked for him to shift his game to being.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s not a good enough to be a primary offensive engine</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not. There&rsquo;s this guy named Jalen Brunson on the team, he&rsquo;s kinda good at basketball.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so you’d want him to be good off ball in order to contribute as a 3rd or 4th option</p>

<p>Do you plan to read the article talking about how he&rsquo;s moving the ball with actual numbers and film or are you going to continue speaking in hypotheticals because you&rsquo;re already locked into your opinion?</p>

<p>He was on the dogshit post-Achilles tear Kobe Lakers and then in New Orleans for a year with AD quitting on the season, what point are you even trying to make here?</p>

<p>At 31% lmao. No one is guarding him when he’s off the ball. He doesn’t space the floor at all.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not. There&rsquo;s this guy named Jalen Brunson on the team, he&rsquo;s kinda good at basketball.</p>

<p>Okay? We’re talking about his value around the league. No one is gonna want to pay him to be their best or second best player.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was on the dogshit post-Achilles tear Kobe Lakers and then in New Orleans for a year with AD quitting on the season, what point are you even trying to make here?</p>

<p>That if Randle is a foundational player on your team, your team pretty much sucks. Thus no one would want to pay him big money.</p>

<p>And no im not gonna read your articles from Knicks fan boy media lol. The Knicks just spent all their draft capital to make it so Randle is no longer a key part of their future, so even your front office realizes he’s not good enough to be a max player that you’d want to build around.</p>

<p>Do you honestly believe that The Athletic are not only Knick fanboys, but Julius Randle fanboys? Have you not heard how Randle is talked about by New York media?</p>

      <label for="lg7siyw" class="commentText"><p>I think in a vacuum Randle is a better player, but I think OG has a better chance of being a quality piece on a championship level roster than Randle can. As talented as Randle is, I have my doubts about whether he can integrate his game sufficiently to be integral to winning basketball games in the deep stages of the playoffs.</p>

<p>In the last rounds of the playoffs, you need 5 man units where every single person out there can&rsquo;t be ignored on offense or targeted on defense, not in any situation. That means every player must be a good enough shooter from 3 that the other team can&rsquo;t sag too far off of them, and they need to be able to switch out to the perimeter on defense to guard quick players when they get put in pick and rolls.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Randle can effectively do that or not. He&rsquo;s an amazing 82 game player, and is crucial for the Knicks success during the regular season, but I&rsquo;m not totally sure if he&rsquo;s a 16 game player who&rsquo;s great for the playoffs. If he&rsquo;s not, or if it&rsquo;s really much of a question, then the Knicks should not max him. You don&rsquo;t want a player making that kind of money sitting on the bench during the most crucial points of the season. Just look at what happens with Rudy Gobert every year.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a good thing we have expert marksmen like Josh Hart who are known for their prominent 3 point shooting.</p>

<p>The idea that Thibs would be benching Randle in crunch time is laughable to anybody who has watched more than 30 seconds of Knick basketball in the last 5 years.</p>

      <label for="lg7veo5" class="commentText"><p>You need to be thinking about it in terms of matching against Boston and possibly Philly. If Randle gets switched onto guarding Maxey on the perimeter, can he handle that well enough that Philly doesn&rsquo;t just start spamming that over and over down the stretch? Cause if not, that&rsquo;s how good players can get played off the floor in the playoffs. In the last two rounds of the playoffs, you can&rsquo;t hide <em>anybody</em> out there, not on either side of the floor. Everyone must be good at every aspect at the very least.</p>

<p>As for shooting, you don&rsquo;t have to have a 5 man unit that can all shoot over 40% from 3, but you need every one of them to be good enough from there that if they&rsquo;re playing off ball that their defender can&rsquo;t just leave them alone to go double team with impunity. You need to make sure if they leave Randle alone on the perimeter and the ball gets kicked to him that he can make them pay for doing so by hitting those shots.</p>

<p>Also, I want to emphasize I&rsquo;m not saying Randle <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do this stuff, I&rsquo;m not saying the Knicks shouldn&rsquo;t pay him. You watch them every game, so you would know. If you think he&rsquo;s susceptible to getting beat in these ways, then the Knicks shouldn&rsquo;t pay him that much money. If he&rsquo;s totally fine in these scenarios, and will hold up great no matter who he&rsquo;s matched up with, then he&rsquo;s worth the money. I am not in any way trying to say anything declarative about Randle, just that I might have some questions about how effective he would be at those levels. If you don&rsquo;t, well you would know better than me cause you watch him more than I do.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re aware Philly is going to be wildly different this year than they were last year, right? Also, Randle being absent doesn&rsquo;t answer the question about how he can defend Maxey if Philly gets that switch. How is Randle with handling quick guards on the perimeter? Can he stay in front of them, or does he get cooked?</p>

Yeah OG or Mikal might start out on Maxey (or maybe Brunson or someone else), but all the other team has to do is just call whomever the guy guarding Randle is out to set a pick and boom, now you&rsquo;ve got a switch with Randle guarding Maxey. If Maxey cooks him, they&rsquo;ll just keep running it until Randle is taken out of the game or until the Knicks figure out a way to stop it.</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;m not saying whether Randle is good or bad in this situation. I&rsquo;m asking you this question as someone who watches a lot of him. Does he get cooked by quick guards on the perimeter or can he hold his own out there and put up a good fight? If he can, then you&rsquo;re good. But if he is susceptible to getting burned in that situation, then that&rsquo;s not someone you want to be paying max money to unless he&rsquo;s so devastating on offense that it&rsquo;s worth what you&rsquo;re giving away defensively.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not against Randle or against the Knicks here. I&rsquo;m just telling you that the Knicks have elevated themselves onto a top tier now, and if you guys are gonna make a real run at a championship, this is going to come up. It comes up with <em>every</em> team that makes a serious title run. The teams that win it all are the ones that can field at least one five man unit where there are no weaknesses anywhere on the floor at either offense or defense. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re all excellent at <em>everything</em>, just that there&rsquo;s no area in which they can be exploited. Is Randle such a player? I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m guessing you do.</p>

      <label for="lg8vif5" class="commentText"><p>Since Playoff P started his career, Playoff P made 3 conference finals, one of which he eliminated the Knicks to get there. The Knicks on the other hand made 0 conference finals during that same time frame.</p>

<p>So yeah if the Knicks had PG last season they would have made the ECF, although that’s not saying much with how weak the East is.</p>
