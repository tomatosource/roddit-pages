<p>“In the wake of Brunson&rsquo;s decision [to extend], there were two questions NBA team executives and agents posed for both New York and the league:</p>

<p>Will Brunson&rsquo;s extension decision start a trend of stars prioritizing roster building at the cost of significant finances in response to both the rapidly rising salary cap and the stringent apron rules in the league&rsquo;s new collective bargaining agreement?</p>

<p>And what does Brunson&rsquo;s new deal mean for Julius Randle, who on Saturday becomes eligible to sign a lucrative extension &ndash; and whose upcoming negotiations in New York, team executives told ESPN, will be the ultimate case study under the CBA?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he Jalen Brunson?&rdquo; one Western Conference executive told ESPN when commenting if Randle would be willing to compromise on his next contract, &ldquo;or Paul George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The money available to re-sign your own players is so great, but the apron rules are so prohibitive, one Eastern Conference executive told ESPN: &ldquo;There has to be a balance on how a team can remain competitive but also reward a player financially.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lg7ngzw" class="commentText"><p>Exactly.  Brunson did what he felt was the right choice in locking in money now while having the opportunity to hit free agency the year he&rsquo;s eligible for a 35% supermax.  Randle&rsquo;s already at 10+ years of service, so it&rsquo;s a different situation for him.</p>

      <label for="lg7vnuj" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a tough situation for both sides to guage a fair contract.  He&rsquo;s played his best ball the past 2 years and made the All-Star team twice.  On the other hand, he&rsquo;s going into his age 30 season coming off shoulder surgery.  It would not surprise me if he ends up going to free agency next year to give both sides a chance to figure out his value.  I would be seriously shocked if the Knicks gave him a max or anything close to it at this time.</p>

<p>If no extension is signed we go into next off season when Randle tests the marker(eligible for some absurd 324 mil deal). At the point, the Knicks do not have to pay him that. If another team wants to pay him or that or anywhere close great that team can have him, but likely no one will be willing to sign Randle to a contract anywhere near that number, so the Knicks will likely be able to sign him for much less. I really just don’t understand the concept of “having to pay ur players the max” that’s only an issue if other teams r willing to pay.</p>

<p>You can just as easily flip that argument by bringing up what OG is making.</p>

      <label for="lg7su6v" class="commentText"><p>OG is a different situation as he was a UFA and had actual competitors like Philly ready to offer him the max. The market for elite 3&amp;D wings is much stronger than a player like Randle as well. Randle is a solid player but he’s nowhere near a max level player. He should not expect the Knicks to offer max money.</p>

      <label for="lg7nj78" class="commentText"><p>Ok? Og makes about 5 mil more per year than Brunson. However Brunson extension kicks in a year later(idk if this important) so difference between first year of each then second year and so on is about 2 mil. Point is Og is only making so much more due to that fifth year. I’d randle takes a similar contract to Og thatd also be chill since it’s similar AAV</p>

      <label for="lg7od5n" class="commentText"><p>But the point still remains. The argument &ldquo;this is what Brunson makes, we&rsquo;re paying you that&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really make sense when Brunson isn&rsquo;t actually the highest paid guy on the team. Unlike say, the contract PG wanted from the Clippers where he wanted the same thing Kawhi got cause he shouldn&rsquo;t make more than Kawhi.</p>

<p>If he makes the same as OG got, that&rsquo;s cool. But we&rsquo;re talking very small amounts under the max, which still isn&rsquo;t down with what Brunson got.</p>

      <label for="lg7oq6w" class="commentText"><p>Sorry I should have specified the Og contract than. My argument is that Idt we should be paying Randle 45 mil a year (I think about 40 a year is fine maybe a bit over). Ik the difference is pretty small there tbh if he signs the extension I’m cool w it. What i don’t understand is the idea that if we don’t extend him we’ll have to pay him 4 years 320 mil next summer to keep him, that’s the main part of my original post I stand by</p>

      <label for="lg7qkc7" class="commentText"><p>That’s some BS framing. Really hope NBA media isn’t going to start using Brunson making a one off (still yet to be determined whether or not it’ll bite him) choice under a circumstance that almost surely no other NBA player will find themselves in (aka reuniting with their college team) to start painting players as selfish for choosing to rightfully take all of the money they can get in the window they have as a player.</p>

<p>Randle has been the best player for the Knicks over the last decade (besides Jalen but he’s also been here longer and took us from bad to good) and every season he gets absolutely disrespected from the media and Knicks fans alike. Also he’s already at the 10 year vet level. He’s in a completely different situation and should absolutely take the money</p>

<p>This is gonna be an interesting negotiation. I genuinely believe he has very little value around the league. I just can’t imagine any team wanting to sign this guy to a max or near max contract. No rational front office would want him as their best, second best, or even 3rd best player and his skill set doesn’t lend itself to playing a role either. He’s gotta be one of the toughest guys in the league to value because he puts up big numbers but you wouldn’t want him on your team.</p>

<p>Well he sucks at shooting so that’s probably true. But if he was ever gonna be a good complimentary player, you’d want him to be able to space the floor. He’s not a good enough to be a primary offensive engine so you’d want him to be good off ball in order to contribute as a 3rd or 4th option.</p>

<p>The guy is 29 and has a horrific playoff resume. The fact that he barely ever made it is a reflection of how little he contributes to winning in the first place.</p>

<p>2 threes a game from a guy who plays in the paint is a guy who can space the floor. Would you rather he shoots 8 threes a game at 34% like he did the year before? If you would actually read the articles I linked (which you won&rsquo;t) you&rsquo;d see how his game has shifted over the course of his time in New York and how he&rsquo;s doing all the things people have asked for him to shift his game to being.</p>

<p>That if Randle is a foundational player on your team, your team pretty much sucks. Thus no one would want to pay him big money.</p>

<p>And no im not gonna read your articles from Knicks fan boy media lol. The Knicks just spent all their draft capital to make it so Randle is no longer a key part of their future, so even your front office realizes he’s not good enough to be a max player that you’d want to build around.</p>

      <label for="lg7siyw" class="commentText"><p>I think in a vacuum Randle is a better player, but I think OG has a better chance of being a quality piece on a championship level roster than Randle can. As talented as Randle is, I have my doubts about whether he can integrate his game sufficiently to be integral to winning basketball games in the deep stages of the playoffs.</p>

<p>In the last rounds of the playoffs, you need 5 man units where every single person out there can&rsquo;t be ignored on offense or targeted on defense, not in any situation. That means every player must be a good enough shooter from 3 that the other team can&rsquo;t sag too far off of them, and they need to be able to switch out to the perimeter on defense to guard quick players when they get put in pick and rolls.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Randle can effectively do that or not. He&rsquo;s an amazing 82 game player, and is crucial for the Knicks success during the regular season, but I&rsquo;m not totally sure if he&rsquo;s a 16 game player who&rsquo;s great for the playoffs. If he&rsquo;s not, or if it&rsquo;s really much of a question, then the Knicks should not max him. You don&rsquo;t want a player making that kind of money sitting on the bench during the most crucial points of the season. Just look at what happens with Rudy Gobert every year.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a good thing we have expert marksmen like Josh Hart who are known for their prominent 3 point shooting.</p>

<p>The idea that Thibs would be benching Randle in crunch time is laughable to anybody who has watched more than 30 seconds of Knick basketball in the last 5 years.</p>

      <label for="lg7veo5" class="commentText"><p>You need to be thinking about it in terms of matching against Boston and possibly Philly. If Randle gets switched onto guarding Maxey on the perimeter, can he handle that well enough that Philly doesn&rsquo;t just start spamming that over and over down the stretch? Cause if not, that&rsquo;s how good players can get played off the floor in the playoffs. In the last two rounds of the playoffs, you can&rsquo;t hide <em>anybody</em> out there, not on either side of the floor. Everyone must be good at every aspect at the very least.</p>

<p>As for shooting, you don&rsquo;t have to have a 5 man unit that can all shoot over 40% from 3, but you need every one of them to be good enough from there that if they&rsquo;re playing off ball that their defender can&rsquo;t just leave them alone to go double team with impunity. You need to make sure if they leave Randle alone on the perimeter and the ball gets kicked to him that he can make them pay for doing so by hitting those shots.</p>

<p>Also, I want to emphasize I&rsquo;m not saying Randle <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do this stuff, I&rsquo;m not saying the Knicks shouldn&rsquo;t pay him. You watch them every game, so you would know. If you think he&rsquo;s susceptible to getting beat in these ways, then the Knicks shouldn&rsquo;t pay him that much money. If he&rsquo;s totally fine in these scenarios, and will hold up great no matter who he&rsquo;s matched up with, then he&rsquo;s worth the money. I am not in any way trying to say anything declarative about Randle, just that I might have some questions about how effective he would be at those levels. If you don&rsquo;t, well you would know better than me cause you watch him more than I do.</p>

<p>As for shooting, you don&rsquo;t have to have a 5 man unit that can all shoot over 40% from 3, but you need every one of them to be good enough from there that if they&rsquo;re playing off ball that their defender can&rsquo;t just leave them alone to go double team with impunity.</p>

<p>Randle is a better shooter than when we had Hart out there&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lg7ptic" class="commentText"><p>Whether the Knicks see him as a #2 on a title team or are looking for somebody else is up in the air, but the idea that they&rsquo;re just desperate to push him out the door is not true by any sort of reporting.</p>

<p>The Knicks should not offer that extension. They will regret it. Save this comment and feel free to @ the shit out of me in 3 years if they do.</p>
