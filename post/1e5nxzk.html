Bam Adebayo&rsquo;s best case for DPOY was clearly in 2022 on the #1 seed and the #5 defense. Given that Giannis and Smart won in those years, why is Gobert blamed for neither having a DPOY?</p>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This is a sentiment I constantly see in this sub but the reality is that the years where Gobert DIDN&rsquo;T win were by far the best chance for one of AD or Bam to pick up a DPOY</p>

<p>Mainly the thing is that the Heat and Lakers have consistently been very mediocre in the regular season outside of these seasons which makes it unlikely their players will outright win big awards</p>

<p>Neither of these were voter fatigue. They&rsquo;re both easily explained by team performance. The Bulls had the best record in the league, which has always been a tiebreaker in MVP voting. Utah wasn&rsquo;t a top 5 defense, which has been a semi-requirement in recent DPOY voting.</p>

      <label for="ldnc1lt" class="commentText"><p>It’s pretty hard to reconcile the top 5 defense requirement with this past year’s voting though. Wembanyama got more votes this past year than Gobert did in 2022 despite being on the 22nd ranked defense to 2022 Utah’s 9th. Voters looked at the Spurs’ defensive on/off and decided not to punish Wembanyama too much for having poor teammates, but didn’t do the same just 2 years prior when Gobert had an even bigger defensive on/off. And Gobert 24 was a way better candidate to steal votes from than 22 Smart.</p>

<p>Overall defensive rank has always been important, but it doesn’t come anywhere near close to explaining the 22 defensive race by itself. Our defense with Gobert on was 4th, him off 27th. Differentials like that have always been considered, especially Mutumbo winning in 98 on the 13th ranked defense but a great on/off.</p>

<p>Similar thing with Lebron/Rose. Record’s always been considered but only when the stats are close and they were not.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a requirement for the majority of voters, not all voters. That&rsquo;s why Gobert got votes in 2022 and Wemby got votes last year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Gobert 24 was a way better candidate to steal votes from than 22 Smart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Smart got 37 first place votes in 2022 and Gobert got 79 last year.</p>

<p>Most voters didn&rsquo;t have Smart first, they just didn&rsquo;t consider Gobert for first because the Jazz weren&rsquo;t good enough.</p>

<p>I obviously agree with you that Gobert deserved it in 2022. But I don&rsquo;t think the majority of voters have ever looked at on/off DRTG.</p>

<p>Timelord would’ve been the next choice, leading the leagues 2nd best defense and still a great one. He got hurt.</p>

<p>This is exactly the problem.</p>

<p>Gobert won DPOY in 2018 playing <sup>56</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub> games — this set the record for <strong>the lowest % games played in the history of the DPOY award</strong>.</p>

<p>JJJ won in 2023 playing <sup>63</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub> games and averaging only 28 minutes per game — <strong>this set the record for lowest minutes in the history of the DPOY award.</strong></p>

<p>Yet the argument against Bam (and Davis) has frequently been that they never play enough games despite playing as many or more games and minutes than both of these winners in those years.</p>

<p>This is not to say Gobert or JJJ didn’t deserve to win those years either, but it illustrates the fact that total games and minutes is only used as an excuse when the media wants to use it.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t follow the Celtics enough to know how their best defender was but it was kinda funny how quickly the narrative formed. I don&rsquo;t think there was a clear consensus winner that year anyways. The other option was Mikal and that also would&rsquo;ve been hilarious.</p>

      <label for="ldncg1c" class="commentText"><p>On/off is dumb for this kind of thing, there is no team in the world that is worse defensively with AD on.</p>

<p>The 2020 Lakers had the best defense I&rsquo;ve seen since the 04 Pistons. Particularly in games that mattered, they would simply shut off the water for the opposing team for long stretches of the game. IIRC they went on something like a 46-12 run in game 1 of the finals. They even went on an 18-0 run on the Bucks down the stretch of their pre-COVID matchup.</p>

<p>So while I&rsquo;m not arguing against the overall DRtg stats or even the Giannis DPOY, the Lakers had a far superior defensive ceiling than any team that year. So I wouldn&rsquo;t use team stats to justify Giannis&rsquo; selection above AD because both teams had great defenses. There may have been other reasons to choose Giannis since he was an absolute destroyer of worlds that year and the following year, and I think AD is actually a better overall defender now than he was in 2020.</p>

      <label for="ldnlo3w" class="commentText"><p>It’s crazy how meaningless regular season awards are when these DPOYs get exposed for being regular season merchants every year. Smart allowed Steph to have his greatest finals performance ever. Gobert gets exposed on the switch every single playoffs. JJJ was the main target by the Lakers in that first round, where he got exposed as he is more of a Whiteside type defender. Then he got exposed against in FIBA.</p>

<p>Then we have actual anchor defenders like Bam and AD who pass the eye test so much more and are clearly more impactful (as seen by the Olympics so far, for example) who EVERY YEAR are the best defender by FAR in their respected conference. But they will never win because they don’t hunt for blocks and the like as they are anchor switching defenders who cover an entire team instead of playing help and hunting blocks.</p>

<p>OP doesn’t have a point, he is just spouting off-season nonsense. Those guys have never been the best defender in the league in a given season, it’s that simple.</p>

<p>Gobert was the overwhelming favorite all year, Wemby just made it interesting because of his crazy block numbers…but that has nothing to do with AD or Bam, so what’s your point?</p>

<p>This is factually wrong. I could send thousands of tweets making fun of Gobert, I could send you clips of Brunson, Hart, Demarcus Cousins, Lou Williams, KG or Paul Pierce openly clowning Gobert. I could also send you articles about it.</p>

<p>I follow the nba and know for a fact you can’t do the same with Smart. Him getting a DPOY was controversial, but it’s like <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of what Gobert getting</p>

<p>The amount that Smart’s award was questioned vs Gobert’s awards were questioned is night and day. People might hate Gobert and make jokes at his expense or take shots at his playoff impact, but people absolutely shit on Smart winning it and said it was due to the influence of Boston sports media etc. You’re just wrong or materially mischaracterizing the dialogues.</p>

They have been the #1 best defender in the playoffs every single year in their respected conference by FAR.

<p>It just makes the award weird. Like MVP is a bit inaccurate, but it gives you a pretty good idea of who was the best player. But then DPOY is only tangentially related, and sometimes inversely related to the best defensive player. Weird stuff.</p>

      <label for="ldn8lyx" class="commentText"><p>Think of it like popular vote vs electoral college (or proportional representation vs first past the post).</p>

<p>You can get 49% of the vote in every state and get 0 electoral college votes. 538-0 in the electoral college wouldn’t describe such an election anymore accurately than Rudy-4 AD/Bam-0 accurately assess each players individual defensive ability.</p>

<p>Looking at DPOY shares a la MVP shares (getting 50% of available votes gives .5 pts) gives guys who are great but never quite #1 better representation in the picture.</p>

Rudy is never gonna show up in those game recaps other than the times he gets got. But if you watch the game, you&rsquo;d see he&rsquo;s the biggest paint deterrent until Wemby grabs the crown.</p>

<p>The reality is you need to lead a great regular season defense and you need to play a lot of the games. AD has struggled with both, Bam with the first bit</p>
