      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e5nxzk/anthony_daviss_best_case_for_dpoy_was_in_2020_on/"><p>Anthony Davis&rsquo;s best case for DPOY was in 2020 on the #1 seed and the #3 defense with no All-Defensive teammates. Bam Adebayo&rsquo;s best case for DPOY was clearly in 2022 on the #1 seed and the #5 defense. Given that Giannis and Smart won in those years, why is Gobert blamed for neither having a DPOY?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This is a sentiment I constantly see in this sub but the reality is that the years where Gobert DIDN&rsquo;T win were by far the best chance for one of AD or Bam to pick up a DPOY</p>

<p>Mainly the thing is that the Heat and Lakers have consistently been very mediocre in the regular season outside of these seasons which makes it unlikely their players will outright win big awards</p>

All you need to do is look at the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trp_dbl_yearly.html" target="_blank">triple double leader by season list</a> and it&rsquo;s easy to understand the misstep by the voters at the time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Neither of these were voter fatigue. They&rsquo;re both easily explained by team performance. The Bulls had the best record in the league, which has always been a tiebreaker in MVP voting. Utah wasn&rsquo;t a top 5 defense, which has been a semi-requirement in recent DPOY voting.</p>

      <label for="ldnc1lt" class="commentText"><p>It’s pretty hard to reconcile the top 5 defense requirement with this past year’s voting though. Wembanyama got more votes this past year than Gobert did in 2022 despite being on the 22nd ranked defense to 2022 Utah’s 9th. Voters looked at the Spurs’ defensive on/off and decided not to punish Wembanyama too much for having poor teammates, but didn’t do the same just 2 years prior when Gobert had an even bigger defensive on/off. And Gobert 24 was a way better candidate to steal votes from than 22 Smart.</p>

<p>Overall defensive rank has always been important, but it doesn’t come anywhere near close to explaining the 22 defensive race by itself. Our defense with Gobert on was 4th, him off 27th. Differentials like that have always been considered, especially Mutumbo winning in 98 on the 13th ranked defense but a great on/off.</p>

<p>Similar thing with Lebron/Rose. Record’s always been considered but only when the stats are close and they were not.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a requirement for the majority of voters, not all voters. That&rsquo;s why Gobert got votes in 2022 and Wemby got votes last year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Gobert 24 was a way better candidate to steal votes from than 22 Smart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Smart got 37 first place votes in 2022 and Gobert got 79 last year.</p>

<p>Most voters didn&rsquo;t have Smart first, they just didn&rsquo;t consider Gobert for first because the Jazz weren&rsquo;t good enough.</p>

<p>I obviously agree with you that Gobert deserved it in 2022. But I don&rsquo;t think the majority of voters have ever looked at on/off DRTG.</p>

<p>Draymond would have won it at a canter as the Warriors were one of the greatest defensive teams of all time at Christmas with him on the floor. He hurt his back.</p>

<p>Timelord would’ve been the next choice, leading the leagues 2nd best defense and still a great one. He got hurt.</p>

<p>Gobert was suffering from voter fatigue despite his impact being sizeable.</p>

<p>Bam missed games.</p>

<p>This is exactly the problem.</p>

<p>Gobert won DPOY in 2018 playing <sup>56</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub> games — this set the record for <strong>the lowest % games played in the history of the DPOY award</strong>.</p>

<p>JJJ won in 2023 playing <sup>63</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub> games and averaging only 28 minutes per game — <strong>this set the record for lowest minutes in the history of the DPOY award.</strong></p>

<p>Yet the argument against Bam (and Davis) has frequently been that they never play enough games despite playing as many or more games and minutes than both of these winners in those years.</p>

<p>This is not to say Gobert or JJJ didn’t deserve to win those years either, but it illustrates the fact that total games and minutes is only used as an excuse when the media wants to use it.</p>

      <label for="ldnwldt" class="commentText"><p>For the millionth time, the playoffs does not factor into DPOY voting. JJJ was far and away the best defensive player during that regular season.</p>

<p>I wonder what your eye test looks for considering that with JJJ on the floor, the Grizz went from a bottom 5 defense to a top 2 defense in the league and he did that by swatting dudes out of the gym most nights. Not gonna ask about metrics cuz the Grizz fan below me already did and you didn&rsquo;t answer so I&rsquo;m just gonna assume you&rsquo;re making that up too.</p>

<p>Bam was the most deserving, he played more minutes that year than JJJ the next year and JJJ had way better competition and still won.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also Vegas odds. Rob Will was #1 and Gobert #2. Then Rob Will gets injured and Smart went from like 7th to 1st within 2 weeks. It was incredible to watch</p>

<p>Time Lord was going to win it easily. Smart wouldn&rsquo;t have been on many ballots.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t follow the Celtics enough to know how their best defender was but it was kinda funny how quickly the narrative formed. I don&rsquo;t think there was a clear consensus winner that year anyways. The other option was Mikal and that also would&rsquo;ve been hilarious.</p>

<p>So Rudy’s name gets brought up as a “well Rudy Gobert got it despite only playing 56 games” and his name gets negatively associated with that players fanbase when the games played is used against them.</p>

This is why a stat has to match the eye test for it to be meaningful.  If a stat just blatantly goes against what everyone sees, it’s not a good stat.  A stat needs to accurately describe a situation to be useful.  You can use math to crunch the numbers however you want to make any stat imaginable, but it doesn’t mean it’s a useful stat</p>

It doesn’t mean the derived number, however you find it, is meaningful.  All the stats, even ones that have a mathematical formula, are derived somewhere from the game.  But that doesn’t mean they will tell you anything meaningful.  The point of stats are to try to accurately describe what happens with numbers.  And I just googled it, the stat is defensive box score plus minus that says that Jokic is the best defender in the league according to this stat.</p>

      <label for="ldncg1c" class="commentText"><p>On/off is dumb for this kind of thing, there is no team in the world that is worse defensively with AD on.</p>

<p>The 2020 Lakers had the best defense I&rsquo;ve seen since the 04 Pistons. Particularly in games that mattered, they would simply shut off the water for the opposing team for long stretches of the game. IIRC they went on something like a 46-12 run in game 1 of the finals. They even went on an 18-0 run on the Bucks down the stretch of their pre-COVID matchup.</p>

<p>So while I&rsquo;m not arguing against the overall DRtg stats or even the Giannis DPOY, the Lakers had a far superior defensive ceiling than any team that year. So I wouldn&rsquo;t use team stats to justify Giannis&rsquo; selection above AD because both teams had great defenses. There may have been other reasons to choose Giannis since he was an absolute destroyer of worlds that year and the following year, and I think AD is actually a better overall defender now than he was in 2020.</p>

      <label for="ldnx34q" class="commentText"><p>Sure, I&rsquo;m questioning the premise that the Bucks were a &ldquo;far better&rdquo; defensive team in the regular season that year and also the idea that you can assess that with just DRtg stats alone. So many things can inflate and manipulate those stats including level of competition, injuries, blowouts / garbage time, etc. it&rsquo;s the same reason I don&rsquo;t view this year&rsquo;s Celtics in the same tier as the 96 Bulls or <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> Warriors just because they had an awesome point differential.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, if regular season team DRtg is the most important factor for DPOY selection, why the hell was Wemby #2 in this year&rsquo;s voting? Pretending like there&rsquo;s some science and logic to these selections, and then creating justifications after the fact is kind of silly.</p>

      <label for="ldny1xz" class="commentText"><p>Defensive rating is literally a measure of a teams defensive performance over a given sample. We’re talking about a sample of 82 games, none of those factors are very influential, especially when those factors exist for every team in the league. And the bucks were 3.6 points better on average which is a very large gap. For reference that’s the same sized gap as 3rd ranked LAL 14th ranked Memphis. Even in the playoffs LAL only placed 6th btw.</p>

<p>And wemby didn’t win did he ? Gobert won… because of them being sizeably the best defensive team in the league and him being the catalyst of that. Wemby placed highly because despite the spurs being a mediocre defence he was absurdly impactful on them. Plenty of players have placed in recent years for similar reasons. What matters most is impact, usually impact is represented by being the anchor to a top defence, much like for mvp it’s being the best player on a top seed. Sometimes players are so impactful they still get consideration for maximizing otherwise terrible rosters, like Jokic winning mvp when he was the sixth seed.</p>

      <label for="ldo0h2y" class="commentText"><p>You are essentially saying that a team that beats team X by 20 is better than a team that beats team X by 10, and extrapolating that as gospel. What if the second team was up by 30 and their 3rd stringers let the other team shave 15 pts off in the fourth? I understand this is a single sample and you might argue that it should normalize over the course of a season but I see no data that says that is a fact. And yes I&rsquo;m using point differential not DRtg as an example but the principle holds.</p>

<p>Stats are one indicator but not the only one. Especially when other factors like strength of schedule, outliers, injuries, etc are not controlled between teams and the whole damn season was shut down midway through the year.</p>

<p>To be clear, there&rsquo;s three arguments in this sub thread: 1) the Bucks were &ldquo;far better&rdquo; than the Lakers defensively and 2) whether this alleged delta in team performance should matter in DPOY voting, and 3) Giannis deserved the DPOY. I happen to disagree with 1 and 2 and am agnostic on 3.</p>

      <label for="ldnlo3w" class="commentText"><p>It’s crazy how meaningless regular season awards are when these DPOYs get exposed for being regular season merchants every year. Smart allowed Steph to have his greatest finals performance ever. Gobert gets exposed on the switch every single playoffs. JJJ was the main target by the Lakers in that first round, where he got exposed as he is more of a Whiteside type defender. Then he got exposed against in FIBA.</p>

<p>Then we have actual anchor defenders like Bam and AD who pass the eye test so much more and are clearly more impactful (as seen by the Olympics so far, for example) who EVERY YEAR are the best defender by FAR in their respected conference. But they will never win because they don’t hunt for blocks and the like as they are anchor switching defenders who cover an entire team instead of playing help and hunting blocks.</p>

      <label for="ldnqjzf" class="commentText"><p>For starters you’re essentially having a problem with the way all awards have worked in thr nba since their inception.  It’s a regular season award, hence why they’re voted on and determined and used to even be given out before the playoffs. They’re also for that specific season’ hence why we use the year when awarding the players. Theres also specific criteria people use each year to make those assessments rather than just looking at who the best player is in a vaccum, since that relies on samples from other seasons, hence why Lebron isn’t a 10x mvp for instance.</p>

<p>Blaming Marcus smart for Steph curry going off is nonsensical in the first place even if I agree smart shouldn’t have won DPOY. And it shows how disingenuous you’re being with the rest of your points. Steph is one of the offensive goats, and good offence generally beats good defence. On top of this the warriors offence is specifically designed to get Steph open looks off of screens and handoffs and the like, it’s not like smart was being killed in isolation or anything,</p>

<p>Gobert getting ‘exposed on the switch’ is extremely exaggerated. It’s not like average role players are switching onto him and making him the weak link of the team defence. For starters it’s been very circumstantial, generally only the top tier isolation guys have been able to consistently do it like Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving or James harden. Secondly the issue isn’t his inability to guard the perimeter, it’s his teams inability to defend once he’s no longer serving as the anchor around the rim, the clippers series was the most glaring example of that, where Rudy was routinely asked to both guard the paint and help to compensate for his team mates all the time, while also sticking with his man in the corner with Morris or Batum at the 5. It was a lose lose situation due to a unique matchup that no defender was succeeding in.</p>

<p>JJJ was not the main target in that grizzlies series… Memphis did win but it was a slow- grinded out series where the grizzlies couldn’t score. JJJ still did his job. And then you go on to mention FIBA which has different rules and is thus completely irrelevent.  Same with the olympics. We’re talking about NBA players. All that matters is their NBA play. Patty mills turning into an mvp every time he suits up for Australia changes nothing about his perception or his value in the NBA.</p>

<p>AD and Bam are objectively not more impactful, and if your argument relies on the eye test then you sure as hell better be watching the majority of games from all those other players you mentioned. The eye test with Rudy is one of his biggest cases, since watching him play and the way he alters how often teams even attempt to score in the paint, which is the most efficient place to score, is glaring. The amount of shots he alters and the drives he stops and the plays he kills before they even take shape are things that don’t show up in the stat sheet. And smarts entire argument was essentially the eye test of his POA defence.</p>

<p>And no, the reason guys like Rudy win has little to do with their blocks… we’ve seen plenty of top shot blockers not even make all defence (IE Myles Turner). It’s because of their impact which the metrics reflect.</p>

      <label for="ldnsu7r" class="commentText"><p>1 I wasn’t arguing about the regular season. I’m talking about playoff impact, not regular season stat padding as a drop defender.</p>

<p>2, I want you to list off a single defender who’s been better than Bam and AD in the playoffs since the bubble. Both players have respectfully carried their teams playoffs after playoffs since that year. Bam spanked Sabonis round 1, was a major part of the bucks upset, and locked down Tatum off the switch for entire quarters in that round 3 series. AD was objectively better than everyone in the west that year.</p>

<p>Bam in 2022 outplays every big man he faced on the defensive end, then in 2023 plays a major role in slowing down Giannis round 1 (especially the final minutes of game 4 and 5), neutralized the Knicks down low and even out rebounded them, and stomped the Celtics god squad round 3 defensively and offensively. Jokic even shot below average FG% against Bam, though on very high usage.</p>

<p>AD is basically the same, AD objectively was better than JJJ in that playoff run, and outperformed every big man except Jokic who was on another level.</p>

<p>Once again, I challenge you to find another defense since 2020 who’s had their impact on defense playoffs after playoffs.</p>

<li><p>This post, and this subsequent thread, is about DPOY. Which is about regular season, and always has been, just like every other award.</p></li>

<li><p>I don’t really care who’s better in the post season, It’s not relevant to awards which are the point of this post and thread. What I was arguing was your incorrect claims discrediting smart, Gobert and JJJ for their playoff defence. But you could certainly throw Draymond and Gobert in that convo, especially if we’re factoring in both regular season and post season.</p></li>

<p>Gobert was the overwhelming favorite all year, Wemby just made it interesting because of his crazy block numbers…but that has nothing to do with AD or Bam, so what’s your point?</p>

<p>This is factually wrong. I could send thousands of tweets making fun of Gobert, I could send you clips of Brunson, Hart, Demarcus Cousins, Lou Williams, KG or Paul Pierce openly clowning Gobert. I could also send you articles about it.</p>

<p>I follow the nba and know for a fact you can’t do the same with Smart. Him getting a DPOY was controversial, but it’s like <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of what Gobert getting</p>

<p>The amount that Smart’s award was questioned vs Gobert’s awards were questioned is night and day. People might hate Gobert and make jokes at his expense or take shots at his playoff impact, but people absolutely shit on Smart winning it and said it was due to the influence of Boston sports media etc. You’re just wrong or materially mischaracterizing the dialogues.</p>

They have been the #1 best defender in the playoffs every single year in their respected conference by FAR. There’s not a single GM who takes JJJ Smart or Gobert as an anchor defender over Bam and AD on a contending roster.</p>

      <label for="ldnrp4q" class="commentText"><p>Bam was the best defender in the East during the finals run in 2023. Bam also was arguably the best in the 2023 run other than timelord, who was limited. Same in 2020, Bam neutralized Giannis and Tatum for entire quarters. Bam is the #1 defender in the East come playoff time for 4 years now, easy. I don’t think there’s even an argument for anyone else.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at AD. Easily best overall defender by FAR in 2020 in the western conference that playoffs. 2023 he killed JJJ first round and again was the most impactful player in the west conference at defense.</p>

<p>I challenge you to find a single person come playoffs who dethrones either these players.</p>

      <label for="ldnxa95" class="commentText"><p>Just because you say something as a fact, that doesn’t make it a fact. If Bam was the consensus best defender in the league all these years, why have the Heat not been at or around the top ranked team defenses during those times? There’s nothing to support your assertion other than your subjective opinion.</p>

<p>Same goes for the Lakers, if AD was truly the best defender “by far”, how did the Lakers only end up middle of the pack in defensive rating?</p>

<p>You’re just saying shit and labeling it as fact 😂 also it’s a regular season award so literally everything you said based on playoffs wouldn’t be relevant anyway, even if it was true.</p>

<p>It just makes the award weird. Like MVP is a bit inaccurate, but it gives you a pretty good idea of who was the best player. But then DPOY is only tangentially related, and sometimes inversely related to the best defensive player. Weird stuff.</p>

<p>You can get 49% of the vote in every state and get 0 electoral college votes. 538-0 in the electoral college wouldn’t describe such an election anymore accurately than Rudy-4 AD/Bam-0 accurately assess each players individual defensive ability.</p>

<p>Looking at DPOY shares a la MVP shares (getting 50% of available votes gives .5 pts) gives guys who are great but never quite #1 better representation in the picture.</p>

<p>The reality is you need to lead a great regular season defense and you need to play a lot of the games. AD has struggled with both, Bam with the first bit</p>
