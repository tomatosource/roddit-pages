</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Brandon Ingram is at a crossroads.</p>

<p>The former All-Star, whose 27th birthday was just a few days ago, is seeking a maximum contract extension: four years and just north of $200 million. Unfortunately for him, neither his current team, the New Orleans Pelicans, nor any of the league’s 29 others appear inclined to give it to him. Ingram is a very good player, but he isn’t a great one — although he could be if he so chose.</p>

<p>It starts and comes near to ending with Ingram’s three-point shot. Ingram’s career long-range shooting stats are bizarre:</p>

<p><strong>Season | 3PA/gm | 3PAr | 3P%</strong></p>

<p>2016-17 | 2.4 | 27.3% | 29.4%</p>

<p>2017-18 | 1.8 |13.8% | 39.0%</p>

<p>2018-19 | 1.8 | 12.9% | 33.0%</p>

<p>2019-20 | 6.2 | 35.0% | 39.1%</p>

<p>2020-21 | 6.1 | 34.1% | 38.1%</p>

<p>2021-22 | 4.1 | 23.0% | 32.7%</p>

<p>2022-23 | 3.6 | 19.6% | 39.0%</p>

<p>2023-24 | 3.8 | 23.8% | 35.5%</p>

<p>Ingram started as a three-point non-believer while he got his NBA footing under him in Los Angeles, but his triple attempt rate skyrocketed in 2019-20, his first year as a New Orleans Pelican. Under coach Alvin Gentry and playing next to point guards like Jrue Holiday and Lonzo Ball, Ingram launched from deep with a quickfire trebuchet’s volume and accuracy.<a href="https://www.nola.com/sports/pelicans/from-the-ground-up-how-brandon-ingram-a-finalist-for-most-improved-player-rebuilt-his/article_2dd75120-e16b-11ea-be5f-a76618b8c464.html#:~:text=This%20season%2C%20Ingram%20shot%2042%25%20on%204.8%20catch-and-shoot,game%20in%20his%20final%20season%20with%20the%20Lakers." target="_blank"> Better health and a revamped shot form</a> masterminded by shooting coach Fred Vinson didn’t hurt, either.</p>

<p>[Thanks for reading! As always, I&rsquo;ve collected a bunch of illustrative video clips and GIFS in addition to a couple of tables. They <a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">can be viewed in-context in one place here.</a>]</p>

<p>Ingram had nearly identical numbers under Stan Van Gundy in 2020-21, but everything changed in the 2021-22 season. Ingram’s three-point rate dropped significantly thanks to three factors. First, Zion Williamson (and his drive-and-kicks) missed the entire season, depleting Ingram’s catch-and-shoot opportunities. Second, there was no bonafide point guard on the roster — CJ McCollum was a late-trade addition, but he’s more of a combo guard than a floor general. And finally, one-and-done Van Gundy was replaced by Willie Green, who was less militant about forcing Ingram to jack up threes.</p>

<p>With fewer ballhandlers available, Ingram took on more of an on-ball playmaker role, setting a then-career-high in assists. The byproduct of that shift and the personnel issues we discussed: fewer catch-and-shoot opportunities. That’s a real problem for Ingram. Most players have a better conversion rate on catch-and-shoots than pull-ups, but there’s a <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;Season=2018-19" target="_blank">wider discrepancy for Ingram</a> than similar ballhandling stars: <a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">[click here for for table</a>, I&rsquo;m too lazy to format another table in Reddit]</p>

<p>The TL;DR: Ingram is good-to-great at catch-and-shoot triples and quite bad at pull-ups!</p>

<p>By comparison, Khris Middleton, who fills a parallel role for the Milwaukee Bucks, <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203114/shots-dash?SeasonSegment=&amp;PerMode=PerGame&amp;SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;Season=2019-20" target="_blank">has hit at least 36% on pull-up threes in four of the last five season</a>s. Kevin Durant, a superior player with similar tendencies to Ingram, <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201142/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;Season=2018-19" target="_blank">has hit at least 37% in three of the last four</a> (he missed all of 2019-20). It’s a weapon that nearly all perimeter scorers can unsheathe to some extent.</p>

<p>Ingram has always had far more comfort pulling up from the midrange, where he’s very prolific and very good — <a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1742#tab-shooting_accuracy" target="_blank">46% or higher</a> in each of the last four seasons. Midrange jumpers have different mechanics than three-point jumpers, and Ingram is more confident and fluid when he’s closer to the basket: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">video here</a>]</p>

<p>Ingram has a relatively slow but high release. It’s a far better form for shooting over the top of defenders in the midrange than it is for creating space from behind the arc: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">video here</a>]</p>

<p>Ingram’s defenders constantly go under picks, giving him plenty of space to walk into an open three-pointer, but he prefers to take one step inside the arc even when his screener pancakes the defender like <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Whomp" target="_blank">an angry Whomp</a>: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">video here</a>]</p>

<p>The pull-ups are one thing. Ingram isn’t comfortable with them and likely never will be. However, Ingram passes up far too many open catch-and-shoots, a shot he’s good at! The record-scratch moments often end with a forced jumper in traffic or a drive to nowhere that needs an offensive reset.</p>

<p>Far too often, we’ve heard Pelicans play-by-play broadcaster Joel Meyers despondently announce, “Ingram, from 20… and [insert opposing player] corrals the rebound.” This is not an NBA play: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">sad video here</a>]</p>

<p>Defenders know they can run Ingram off the three-point line; in fact, he *wants* to be pushed into his comfort zone (and coach Green has been unwilling to push him back out). His reluctance to fire from deep hinders an offense that needs to space the floor around Zion Williamson to reach its ceiling — and it will inhibit any other team that considers trading for him, too. In this league, it’s nearly impossible to be an effective non-big second or third banana if you can’t shoot from deep.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is that we’ve seen Ingram succeed at a significantly higher level from downtown; can that player return? More importantly, is he *willing* to return? I never want to put much stock in social media posts, especially in this economy. But Ingram did <a href="https://x.com/NickVanExit/status/1829637885890322782" target="_blank">post a curiously salient video</a> a few days ago in which a motivational speaker tells his rapturous audience that they “cannot stay in environments where people don’t know the true value of you. If you stay in environments where people don’t recognize the value of you, you’ll shrink your gift to the size of what they can stand.”</p>

<p>I like this quote, but Ingram is misunderstanding the context. The Pelicans (and the rest of the league) don’t want to shrink Ingram’s gifts. They want him to *expand* his gifts like those inflatable lawn Christmas presents!</p>

<p>In some ways, the stage is set for Ingram to thrive. Zion Williamson is healthy and looking better than ever (stop me if you’ve heard that before), and the trade for Dejounte Murray gives the Pelicans the best point guard they’ve had since Lonzo Ball. You may be surprised to learn that Zion and Ingram on the court *without* CJ McCollum <a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/19/lineups?on=4572&amp;on=1742&amp;off=2390#tab-four_factors" target="_blank">last season had a net rating of +13.4</a> in 706 possessions, in the 98th percentile; with McCollum likely moving to the bench, we should see more of those minutes.</p>

<p>New Orleans now has two players capable of getting both feet into the paint and spraying the ball to open shooters. <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason" target="_blank">Zion was a top-10 three-point creator</a> on a per-possession basis last season (although not many of those went to Ingram), and Murray might approach similar numbers without having to share the rock with Trae Young. If head coach Green and offensive guru James Borrego can effectively create Williamson/Murray actions that suck in the defense, Ingram should have far more catch-and-shoot opportunities.</p>

<p>Is Ingram willing to screen and pop for Murray or Williamson? (Trey Murphy will be a superstar in that role, but Ingram will have chances, too.) Is he willing to show more activity off the ball? I’d like to see Ingram sliding more along the perimeter in reaction to Zion and Murray’s forays into the paint; too often, he appears unaware that he can create passing lanes for others with even subtle shifts. More purposeful movement like this, please: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">video here</a>]</p>

<p>If Ingram *can* rediscover his three-point appetite, he would be an excellent fit for this Pelicans team — or most other contenders. Shot selection aside, he’s a far more complete player than his reputation suggests.</p>

<p>For example, Ingram has sneakily become a very good passer. He’s not always the quickest decision-maker, and he can pound the ball a bit too much for my liking. But he’s learned how to leverage the attention he draws to spring teammates open. He’ll put the ball on the floor and fake a shot for the sole purpose of wedging open a narrow passing window: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">video here</a>]</p>

<p>He’s also become an excellent pick-and-roll player. Ingram was in the 81st percentile for points per pick-and-roll possession, per Synergy. He’s become more creative with his use of space and angles: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/shrinking-your-gift-the-curious-case" target="_blank">video here</a>]</p>

<p>And defensively, Ingram has competed hard of late. His play on that end faltered when he initially moved to the Pelicans, but to his credit, his effort level has increased for the past few seasons. He’s not a top-flight defender, but he’s not the weak link his skeletal (<a href="https://twitter.com/joelvenile/status/1719028831833432080" target="_blank">Skelican</a>?) frame might suggest, either. Synergy rated him in the top quintile in pick-and-roll defense and isolations, and teams rarely targeted him (it helps to play a lot of minutes next to a player with a flashing neon bullseye on his jersey like McCollum).</p>

<p>He’s always been an excellent foul-drawer with high-end free throw percentages. Ingram is even a strong finisher at the rim (although he doesn’t get there as much as I’d like) and an underrated defensive rebounder.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, recency bias has been monstrously detrimental to his playoff character. Ingram rushed back from injury this season and then had to go up against Lu Dort, an elite, physical defender who gave a clearly hobbled Ingram zero breathing room, zero quarter, and zero mercy. But we’re just two years removed from Ingram averaging 27-6-6 on solid shooting while leading the Zion-less Pelicans to two wins against the top-seed Phoenix Suns in the playoffs, all with DPOY runner-up Mikal Bridges hung over his wiry shoulders like a particularly itchy scarf. It was a genuinely impressive performance that showed Ingram’s playoff upside.</p>

<p>There’s a winning basketball player here. All Ingram has to do is move, say, two of his worst midrange attempts (perhaps those deep, one-legged runners he’s inexcusably fond of) to the three-point line, a thing *he’s already done,* and he’d certainly get big dolla bills, y’all!</p>

<p>Well, almost certainly. We alluded to Ingram’s health (or lack thereof). He’s played just 64, 45, and 55 games over the last three years. I believe a market correction on availability is coming — see Kawhi Leonard’s sub-max deal and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5475423/2024/05/06/jimmy-butler-pat-riley-comments/" target="_blank">Pat Riley’s recent comments about Jimmy Butler</a> for two top-of-mind examples. Ingram may be one of the first victims of that mentality.</p>

<p>But we just saw an injury-prone 3-and-D superstar in OG Anunoby get pretty darn close to max money. Currently, Ingram is missing the “3” component that every non-superstar desperately needs to maximize their value. I talk about players needing to increase their three-point volume a lot, but Ingram is the extremely rare case in which we’ve already seen it! The lack of distributors, be they an elite point guard or a healthy Zion, can no longer be an excuse. Ingram will have catch-and-shoot opportunities; he has to take them.</p>

<p>“I know who I am,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4809563/2023/08/27/brandon-ingram-team-usa/" target="_blank">Ingram once said</a>. “In ways, I can get stuck and think my way is the best way.” There’s at least a modicum of self-awareness here. The path to Ingram being a $200 million player (or close to it) is so easy to see. Ingram just needs to stop shrinking his own gifts.</p>

      <label for="llsnct0" class="commentText"><p>Thanks! Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird, because people always talk about the Ingram/Zion/McCollum minutes being not great, which is true. But if you take McCollum out, they obliterate people. It doesn&rsquo;t always look great with Zion a non-shooter and Ingram a reluctant one, but I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot more upside with this pairing than most people do, thanks to a strong and versatile supporting cast.</p>

      <label for="llt0jj7" class="commentText"><p>I think that&rsquo;s just because Spurs fans haven&rsquo;t been clamoring about trading for Ingram.</p>

<p>Kings fans have been yapping nonstop about trading for him for a while now. When we do that, there are 2 complaints in every thread:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t shoot 3s!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s remember that BI wants a max.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every Ingram trade thread basically goes like that, and it&rsquo;s not just in the Kings fandom from what I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

      <label for="llw6ca0" class="commentText"><p>I think the standard for who is considered a worthy max has also changed a lot recently. Years of watching guys like DeRozan, Lavine, Beal, Dlo fail in the playoffs has convinced people that being a pure scorer who doesn&rsquo;t also provide great value in at least one of the other areas (defense, on-ball playmaking, secondary playmaking through spacing and/or screens, offensive rebounding) is not good enough to be considered in the upper echelon of the league, unless you are the runaway winner for the scoring title every year.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, these guys are still very good players. But they&rsquo;re a tier below the supermax level guys who excel at more than one thing, or is pretty good at everything alongside being great at scoring. Until 2020ish though, every 25 ppg scorer was getting offered a max regardless of how he did it or how good he was at other parts of the game.</p>

      <label for="llt40zq" class="commentText"><p>Zion is like a smaller Giannis. He basically needs a 4 out offense to maximize his strengths. Ingram in theory should be able to replicate a Middleton, but KMiddy is a much better and willing 3pt shooter and also a more natural secondary playmaker.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is the Pels are like a worse version of the 2021 Bucks. They have their brute force superstar (though he has significant injury concerns), an allstar calibre second option who can take some scoring load (but is an awful defender and averse to 3s), a defensive oriented pg (whose defense has been ass for a couple years but it was elite at some point), a center who can stretch the floor (not an elite paint protector), and a high energy bench player whose a crowd favorite. That’s not even accounting for Herb, Trey, and CJ.</p>

      <label for="llsoqub" class="commentText"><p>On the subject of pull up 3s vs spotting up, I think part of it is that everyone wants to be that guy who pulls up and shoots 3s. What made Klay special was his willingness to spot up and wait for his shots. He didn&rsquo;t seek them out by going rogue, he was just patient, knowing he would get his every quarter.</p>

<p>Granted, Klay was in the literal perfect situation for him. You need teammates willing to give you the ball in your spots to get those shots. Some teams don&rsquo;t have selfless guys like that giving up their own to feed others, that&rsquo;s when players tend to go more rogue.</p>

I don&rsquo;t honestly think the point guard even needs to be a wizard, I think Murray&rsquo;s ability to drive-and-kick will be the real key.</p>

<p>I remember reading something about how Ingram said he likes playing with a point guard a long time ago. This is his season to show what he&rsquo;s got, we&rsquo;ll see if he can live up to it!</p>

      <label for="lltfw47" class="commentText"><p>I think a lot of times the issue is not an unwillingness to pass, but an unwillingness to pass quickly. When you watch the Pelicans, the ball just tends to stick a second too long with everyone. Ingram is especially guilty of catching, pausing, jab stepping, surveying, jab stepping, and then swinging it. The small pauses ensure that the defense always has enough time to get set and isn&rsquo;t scrambling.</p>

For Zion I think a lot of the problem is no one knows how to move when he has the ball because they dont want to get in his way, so the offense can get kind of stagnant when he catches it even though he&rsquo;s looking for the quick pass.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Ingram is good-to-great at catch-and-shoot triples and quite bad at pull-ups!</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll probably get a chance to prove this. Dejounte and Zion will be responsible for 1st team driving\playmaking while Ingram and CJ chill out behind the arc. Then as the 2nd team comes in, I think Ingram and CJ will have more responsibility.</p>

<p>Once these guys know they can be an all star if you just give them the ball and let them cook, they basically never go back to doing the dirty stuff.  Maybe Ingram is the exception but I kind of doubt it since it seems like he already feels disrespected.</p>

Unfortunately for him, the new cba limits teams from giving him what he wants unless he can be the second best player on a title team.

      <label for="llsvur4" class="commentText"><p>You could be right. I think Ingram has a worse reputation than he deserves for basically all aspects of his non-shot-selection game, though, like I mention. If he does go back to 6ish threes per game, I think one team could talk themselves into him being the second-best player on a title team. Not sure who, but someone usually does.</p>

<p>In general, though, I think Ingram is sort of a test case for the new CBA and the overall spending environment. Teams have proven they&rsquo;ll spend big on really high-level role players; will we see a subsequent decline in spending for lower-tier stars? I think we&rsquo;re headed that way soon.</p>

      <label for="llsxobf" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. I just don’t know what team he makes sense on. He needs the ball to be most effective based on his current skill set, but if he changed to let more of the offense come to him instead of flow through him, his stats might decrease, but he would help winning so much more. It’ll be an interesting year in New Orleans with him, Zion, and dejaunte all wanting to initiate the offense.</p>

      <label for="lltfcmt" class="commentText"><p>Whats funny is that I always thought that CJ should have been shooting way more 3s in Portland. His best stretches of play was when he was getting around 10 3s a game. There actually was a time when Harden requested out of Houston and Portland was on his list but it was during one of CJ stretches where he was shooting a ton of 3s and that was when he was playing his best. Dame was having a mini slump so its hard to tell if we could have had two ball dominant pull up 3 point shooters on the same team, but&hellip;</p>

<p>CJ started off 2021 season when Harden was on his way out of Houston averaging 28/5/4 on <sup>47</sup>&frasl;<sub>43</sub> shooting splits shooting 11 3s a night. Then he got hurt and went back to normal but I truly believe that Blazers thought they didn&rsquo;t need to trade CJ because he was turning a corner and becoming a Harden lite :(</p>

<p>Sorry this just reminded me of that memory but I do think guys like CJ and Ingram both need to commit to shooting more 3s. Then you add in Dejounte to that group and it gets tricky&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lltosaa" class="commentText"><p>I get the impression BI just isn&rsquo;t very good at catching the ball outside the arc fully ready to react.  It seems to take him an extra <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> beat to get his balance, even while stationary, and if he&rsquo;s moving parallel or away from the basket on the catch, nothing is happening til he stops and establishes triple threat.  Totally speculative, but to me he just doesn&rsquo;t look like a guy who puts in a meaningful amount of focused, game speed, contested, catch and shoot reps in practice, so is right to not feel confident shooting them in game.  If you compare how BI catches the ball or moves off-ball compared to a guy like Lauri Markkanen, it&rsquo;s really hard to believe he takes that aspect of the game seriously.  Maybe it&rsquo;s a coaching issue, but I worry that BI just believes he&rsquo;s an unappreciated DeMar, and finds being asked to focus on the same stuff in practice as the role players demeaning.</p>

<p>Also dropping into a triple threat to freeze a closeout, then rising up with your length (the kind of catch and shoot he does look comfortable doing) isn&rsquo;t quite as viable as it was 5 years ago.  In 2024, if you shoot 37% or above, you are getting run off the line if the defense is trying, period.</p>

      <label for="lltp7ih" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s a great point. His feet often aren&rsquo;t set, his hands aren&rsquo;t always ready, and his release is just slow. Building on your point, he doesn&rsquo;t hunt these shots by floating along the three-point line, either. He doesn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> them the way he should.</p>

<p>Good comment, thanks.</p>

      <label for="llut23m" class="commentText"><p>Loved the write up. It really has been a frustrating couple of years watching Ingram, but has still been one of my favorite players to wear our colors. From what I&rsquo;ve read and what I&rsquo;ve seen, it almost feels like Murray and his fit is going to be the important thing for us this season (barring&hellip;whatever we have at center).</p>

<p>The hardest part of these types of analyses are that we&rsquo;re asking the player to change something very fundamental about their game. BI was a top 2 pick, won most improved player, made an all star team and received a max all by playing his way.</p>

<p>Agreed that he&rsquo;s now at a crossroads, but I&rsquo;d be very surprised if reacted by turning into the high efficiency player that we all wish he was.</p>

<p>Put more simply: his gift is that he&rsquo;s an elite midrange shot creator, and he&rsquo;s maximized that.</p>

      <label for="lluk7ke" class="commentText"><p>He shot 6 threes a game when he got paid, but also had willing playmakers such as Lonzo and Jrue. He never created 3’s for himself at a really high level, if he could get assisted early and get into a rhythm he would let them go a little more freely</p>

<p>It was mainly two years ago, the year that Zion missed, on top of Lonzo leaving that summer, where he played his most natural style, creating for himself literally the entire time. And even depending on 2’s primarily, he actually played at a really high level; if we didn’t start that season 3-16, on top of him missing a combined 27 games throughout, he would’ve had more steam as a potential all star that year imho. We made the playoffs with him leading us, and he averaged 27 against the first seeded Suns that year.</p>

<p>With Zion playing more since then, we’ve seen that the pairing is awkward with neither being willing shooters from distance. Zion actually created the 10th most assisted threes last season, guys like CJ and Trey ate but for one reason or another BI’s threes have continued to decline. So between Z and now Dejounte, and hopefully a coaching staff scheming to get him looks, and no contract, it’s time to see if he can get back to shooting them.</p>

I cannot remember a player refusing to change his shot diet against all logic, wishes, and incentives especially when you’re clearly a better player if you just pull the fucking trigger on catch and shoot 3s!</p>

<p>It’s befuddling and infuriating. And I really like BI.</p>

      <label for="llvlzkf" class="commentText"><p>Dude is an All-NBA elite level talent. Sad to see his rep take such a nosedive. I honestly dont blame him. His had so many years of Zion being in and out, the team and his role have never had any semblance of stability. He never knows going into the season if hes supposed to be THE guy. When Zion comes back hes not the guy, then he has to be the guy again, then hes not. The best the Pelicans have looked in recent years, was when Zion was conclusively out for the rest of the season and BI and the Pels took it to the Suns in the playoffs</p>
