      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5583540/2024/06/22/klay-thompson-free-agency-warriors-negotiations/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Klay Thompson isn’t currently mulling a shorter-than-desired offer from the Golden State Warriors. Despite a wide open negotiation window, there isn’t a one-year, two-year or three-year deal on the table. Because nothing is currently on the table, according to league sources. There’s been no productive discussion between the Warriors and Thompson or his representatives.</p>

<p>Talks are essentially frozen. With free agency now less than 10 days away, Thompson’s exit from the only franchise he has ever known feels closer and more probable than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Warriors have outwardly maintained their desire to bring Thompson back at the right price and in the right role, per league sources, but have viewed his situation as business to sort through after various other roster-building avenues have been explored</p>

<p>Part of the Warriors’ calculus, it seems, is that Thompson could discover a lukewarm free-agent market and eventually return at a bargain rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has been no traction between Thompson and the Orlando Magic, according to league sources, despite some initial mutual interest. Other cap space teams like the Philadelphia 76ers and Oklahoma City Thunder could theoretically enter the mix. But Thompson’s best offers may end up smaller in money and shorter in years than many predicted or expected, leading some to presume that’ll lead back to an inevitable reunion with the Warriors at a rate both sides are comfortable.</p>

<p>But that’s not necessarily the case. Even if the Warriors eventually approach Thompson with a competitive offer, matching or exceeding the money and years, it has become increasingly conceivable, according to league sources, that Thompson will decide to leave regardless, searching for a fresh start in a different environment, detached from some of the built-up friction of the previous couple seasons.</p>

<p>This could all be heading toward an unceremonious end to a legendary 13-year career with a single franchise.</p>

      <label for="l9t4fw4" class="commentText"><p>Not with his inconsistency. His numbers for the year look okay because he was streaky and had stretches of really bad play. If that happens in the playoffs he could cost you the game if you’re not careful, and nothing hurts a shooter more than constantly wondering if they’re going to get benched.</p>

<p>I think the best spot for him is a team that may overachieve but doesn’t have the win now pressure, like the Rockets or Magic, or maybe even the Spurs.</p>

<p>You throw out that term, I don&rsquo;t think you know who gets it.</p>

<p>Klay is past prime but def way above guys like DeAndre Jordan, Cody zeller, Jaxson Hayes, blake griffin, Jeff green . There&rsquo;s a reason he still have leverage to get 3-4 years contract. There&rsquo;s a chance he could be a starter for a team.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not vet min.</p>

<p>Nah bra he is no longer that good on defense. If thats above average, then the majority of the league is above average on defense.</p>

<p>Realisticly you are only getting him for the 3 point shooting, which is still good.</p>

<p>But paying him anything over 15M a year seems like an overpay at this point and i wouldnt even pay him that.</p>

<p>Or, instead of being the whiney tidbit you think it is, it could come down to role and minutes instead of just the money. This FO has tried their best to draft replacements for all of the big 3 so even if they&rsquo;re not ready, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me to see them putting that into their calculations. That Podz or Moody can pick up the slack, making Klay expendable despite your average coach cringing at the idea of having to start either of them.</p>

<p>He signed for the MLE while he was still rehabbing from a torn achilles. The market out there for him was not great so he opted to rehab his value in a low pressure situation and try to win a ring (almost did) in the process too. His idea was if I show that I’m still a great big man in my short stint on the warriors AND I don’t need to rush back from a very serious injury I could hit FA and get a bag after a good year.</p>

<p>Historically also once a guy in the back half of his career hits the MLE market value its really difficult to get back to a high salary. I would highly doubt that Klay thinks he can get more money in the long run by taking a minimum.</p>

      <label for="l9suce2" class="commentText"><p>I am concerned Klay could end up in Dallas, just because there have been past reports of interest in Klay + the total lack of shot making outside of Luka and Kyrie.</p>

<p>And to be clear my concern only stems from Klay’s attitude. It’s just not obvious to me that he understands what he has to sacrifice in order to be a winning player on a contender. He cannot expect 30+ mins a night no matter what as a third star. His worsened defense and inability to create his own shot can’t justify it anymore.</p>

<p>My sense is he begrudgingly accepted his diminished role in GS toward the end of this season but is now eager to increase his usage/mins in a new environment.</p>
