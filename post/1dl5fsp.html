      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DnKQPpDlrY&amp;" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DnKQPpDlrY&amp;</a></p>

<p>So I started a new video series that takes a close look at NBA history and tries to add context so we can appreciate the value of historical players skill and abilities and not make the same mistakes JJ Redick made, casually writing them off without context. Currently I&rsquo;m working on episode 3 which will be about Willis Reed but this is the second episode of the series. The structure of the game was different back then and few people, recent NBA players included, seem to realize how different it was. I don&rsquo;t see a lot of videos or people really diving into that topic and I feel it needs to be clarified or players in the past often get mislabeled as unskilled or inefficient when actually a lot of them were literally the opposite given what they were allowed to do - the rules were just so drastically different our expectations are out of touch. Hopefully this, and future videos will help shape an appreciation for past NBA legends such as Dolph Schayes.</p>

<p>Schayes&rsquo; son is retired NBA center Danny Schayes, who played in the NBA for 18 seasons. His granddaughters Abi, Carla, and Rachel Goettsch won silver medals for the United States volleyball team at the 2001 Maccabiah Games, and his grandson Mickey Ferri won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 2005 Maccabiah Games.</p>

      <label for="l9ncqgk" class="commentText"><p>Look I’m sure the modern players would kick ass if they were magically transported to the 60s with all of their knowledge of the game that has accumulated and passed down on the past 50-60 years.</p>

<p>The point most of these modern player is missing is that modern players grew up in an era with all of the game footage available to them. When they were learning the game, they already had someone to emulate their game around. A big man can look at footage of Hakeem and learn his footwork, a shooting guard can emulate someone like Reggie, Kobe, MJ, Drexler, etc.</p>

<p>Who did Dolph Schayes have to emulate his game around? When he ran into issues with his jump shot he had to figure it out by himself because there was no one else he could turn to. He didn’t have mentors that has already gone through the same struggles to give him pointers, he didn’t have technology that could tell him he should do x, y and z with his shot.</p>

<p>These guys are pioneers of the game and first hand figured everything out, things that modern players take for granted nowadays. It’s like saying you’re smarter than Newton because you can do calculus.</p>

      <label for="l9n59o2" class="commentText"><p>It’s just funny that JJ Redick of all people was the one to say that because if he was teleported to the 50’s and was a HOF he would be the poster child for people pointing out that the NBA back then was so weak that even short unathletic white guys could dominate.</p>

<p>That being said, I think the 6’8” Schayes would hold his own against Redick, except for maybe the season where he got injured and played most of the season in a cast.</p>

      <label for="l9nbbfl" class="commentText"><p>I didn&rsquo;t compare them in the video because I didn&rsquo;t want to start picking apart JJ&rsquo;s game in the event he or his fans ever came across it I&rsquo;d really rather they just learn how to appreciate a player like Dolph but if I am comparing the two - JJ really played a specialized game running off screens and pulling the trigger from range quickly (but not much else) and that can be very useful on the right team of course, but is nowhere near the impact a player like Dolph makes. Even with his right hand in a cast Dolph still could shoot deep due to his two-hand set shooting style (outdated now, but was valuable to him then especially because of said casts) - but more importantly he also takes it to the rim and forces the defense to react in ways JJ just never proved he could even though he was playing in eras where scoring at the rim had rules that made it a more favorable play. Dolph commanded attention any time he touched the ball because he catches it and immediately you have no idea what he&rsquo;s about to do next as a defender. Always setting screens and cutting, going in either direction, and of course big enough to be a solid rebounder on top of it all. He was never quite an MVP (finished 2nd his best year), but was frequently in contention and it was because he was so dynamic and thus difficult to guard. A real problem out there for other teams to deal with.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents</p>

      <label for="l9nn4y8" class="commentText"><p>Thanks for some much needed nuance and context in this discussion. I think just how successful guys like Dolph would be in the modern NBA is an open question but he was clearly not just a plumber. I see a lot of similarities between his game and a guy like Kevin Love, at the very least. Hard to look at that and conclude he would just be run out of today&rsquo;s league if he played, though who knows if he would still be the championship caliber player that he was in the 50s.</p>

<p>If you tighten up your editing and delivery on these videos, and extrapolate strategy from the rules (eg you touch on why Schayes took deep jumpers rather than layups, but this could be explain this point more systematically) so that we get a cohesive look at the players within the strategic context, you could turn this into a very high value video series comparable to ThinkingBasketball.</p>

<p>It’s not disrespectful to say he played in a weak era and he would not have been nearly as successful today. It’s just obvious as fuck to anybody who isn’t a complete dumbass</p>

      <label for="l9n0f5g" class="commentText"><p>It’s not speculative. Speculating is assuming how he would react to modern training and rules.</p>

<p>We have tape. I don’t know how anybody can watch the tape in this video and come to the conclusion that players from the 1950s and 1960s had comparable skill sets/athleticism. Rule differences aside, look at their shooting forms, their defensive positioning, their touch at the rim, their understanding of space. No modern rule change is going to help any of that.</p>

<p>It’s just insulting to modern players really. It’s not hyperbole to assume that JJ put in more hours of practice and training in 2 years than most 1950s NBA players did in their entire careers. Professional athletes didn’t train the way people do now. And the talent pool was 1% the size. It’s just straight up insane to pretend like there’s been no progression in the sport.</p>

      <label for="l9nf5f1" class="commentText"><p>Rule differences aside? The entire point of the video is that you can&rsquo;t put rule differences aside. Those rule changes are precisely why he plays the way he plays.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at his shooting form for example since you wanted to point it out. But let&rsquo;s do so only in the one spot that&rsquo;s fair, where rules have NOT changed - free throws. He shot over 90% for 2 seasons from the free throw line with that form. So no matter how bad you think it looks - you&rsquo;re looking up hill from a downward spot at a great free throw shooter being that he can shoot like that. Actually 95% of the league today cannot.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re mocking their understanding of space? What do you possibly know that they don&rsquo;t know about proper floor spacing in THAT era. There isn&rsquo;t a 3 point line. Offensive fouls are ridiculously sensitive. You don&rsquo;t get extra steps. You can&rsquo;t resume a dribble if you lose it. You can&rsquo;t carry the ball. The percentages of successes and failures from 5, 10, or 15 feet out are going to be radically different than you are familiar with. Try to understand that it is they that have a feel for the game back then at an extraordinarily elite level and it is you that doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a different game. Those coaches and players back then were masters at their craft. If you want to learn about it do so with an open mind not one as if you&rsquo;re looking down at them.. You&rsquo;re looking at it from your vantage point of today, expecting them to be getting certain success rates you are familiar with today because you have some sort of feel for today&rsquo;s game. But today, it&rsquo;s all based on how the game is officiated and what rules are in place to even get those kinds of plays to happen.</p>

<p>I could go on about this topic but fundamentals you think are normal and &lsquo;correct&rsquo; today are actually turnovers back then and these can make many plays look strange back then. Examples are numerous but another big one for example would be initiating contact while getting to the rim to &lsquo;own&rsquo; the defenders space. Textbook fundamental today. One I remember learning and it really helped my game out. Completely wrong in that era and will get you an offensive foul. These are big differences and are why players and patterns back then can not look quite right to you. But they aren&rsquo;t random.</p>

      <label for="l9n1gf7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not acting like there is no progression. You are acting like if Schayes or any other old player was born or played now they would automatically suck, when they would have access to everything JJ did. You aren&rsquo;t making a fair comparison. I&rsquo;m not saying Schayes, directly teleported from his era, would be as good as a modern player. You are acting like if he was a modern player, born in say 1990 or something, he would FOR SURE suck. That&rsquo;s not fair and you don&rsquo;t KNOW that just by looking at tape like you are implying.</p>

<p>No, I’m literally doing the opposite of that. I have no idea how good he would be if he was born today. It’s insane to pretend that anybody could know that.</p>

<p>Im talking about how he <em>actually</em> played. We have tape of that. Anything else is speculation.</p>

      <label for="l9naz9c" class="commentText"><p>It is disrespectful to hold someone to standards that make no sense for the time they play in. And, yes, it is speculative for your whole point to rest on a hypothetical that is physically impossible to reproduce.</p>

<p>The entire context of the debate was about measuring &ldquo;greatness&rdquo; and whether we should leave people off a list celebrating their greatness simply because we can produce a contemporary measure against which most of believe they couldn&rsquo;t meet. Was the athleticism different, the bodies, the shooting form, the conditioning? Yes, of course. That&rsquo;s precisely why you should be hesitant to make superficial comparisons. How are you going to measure the quickness of a first step when a guy is wearing Chuck Taylors and referees would call the quickest of today&rsquo;s first steps travels?</p>

<p>In other words, your comments change the goalposts of the conversation to being about some science fiction teleportation comparison, not about the real question about the list or whatever which is how do we appreciate the past on its own terms without diminishing the greatness of the present?</p>

      <label for="l9n1o8p" class="commentText"><p>Today there are 450 roster spots and back then there were as few as 80-100.</p>

<p>50 million kids growing up in America had played with a basketball at some point in their childhood and had a chance to learn the game leading up to the generation that stocked the NBA in Dolph Schayes time which only had room for 80-100 players at any given time. 1 in every half million to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of a million people who touched a basketball back then ended up playing in the NBA.</p>

<p>Today, let&rsquo;s say a billion kids grew up to stock the NBA of what we see today but there are 450 spots available That number is one in every 2 to 2.2 million. Sounds like a huge difference right?</p>

<p>Well, 1 in every 40,000 people who touch a basketball become collegiate players today and I often hear people say high school or college players and teams today are on par with past NBA players and that statistic of rarity alone should prove that that isn&rsquo;t true. being 1 among every 500-700 million is much closer to the modern NBA ratio of 1 among 2.2 million than it is to being 1 among 40,000.</p>

<p>G league plus Euroleeague plus NBA combined is actually about identical in ratio to the razors edge of elite that NBA basketball was back even in Dolph Schayes time. And I may be mistaken but those are arguably the 3 top leagues on the planet even today. The world of basketball players today certainly grew. But so did the amount of roster spots and places you could go at to play at a top level.</p>

<p>In other words, from the vantage point of any fan, or even high level players that made it through a modern college program - any NBA player even back in the 1950&rsquo;s should be treated as a razors edge of basketball talent and ability because that&rsquo;s exactly what they were, and still would be considered today. If they look weird or awkward - I personally believe a lot of that is due to the rules as much as anything else. The inference that they are worse because of a smaller sample size shouldn&rsquo;t overlook that the size of the league was also scaled accordingly with a smaller league in that era.</p>

      <label for="l9n4omj" class="commentText"><p>This doesn’t make sense. Thats to get in the nba. If you have 450 spots you have 450 players who can show they are more talented and not cut off as many people in the process. 450 vying for the top 15 that make all nba versus 80. Not to mention all the genetic aberrations who make it in with the far greater population numbers of today. You just can’t compare eras, but if you actually moved a 1950s player into the league today they would get smacked. Theres just no way around it.</p>

      <label for="l9n7d3w" class="commentText"><p>To dominate the NBA the ratio I just talked about still doesn&rsquo;t appreciably change.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>In 1960 out of 99 total players, 13 players averaged over 20ppg
In 2024 out of 572 total players (more than I thought), 38 players averaged over 20ppg and probably there should be more here but I bet a few didn&rsquo;t make basketball reference list due to players not meeting the game count. Players today sit more to rest on injuries vs in the past players just played through them and I think that knocks a few modern guys off the leaderboards. But it&rsquo;s all near as makes little difference the same as what I just explained.</p>

<p>To be an NBA player back then is really about as rare and elite as it is to be in one of the top 3 leagues on the planet today and to be an elite NBA player back then would put you in the same class as elite players today.</p>

<p>The genetic anomaly comment is also scaled accordingly. Learn names about the past players and traits about them. You&rsquo;ll find out the longest armspans, tallest heights, most agile or strong types of players you&rsquo;d expect to see today definitely existed back then too in their own blends. Of course there&rsquo;s always unique players playing today. But the same was true then. Who today is built like Wilt? Anyone? Who EVER was? You can say the same about many players from any era. You can name more names as the league and talent pool increases so yes you get more variety. But remember, back then, the league shrank and was scaled down along with the talent pool. The level of elite you&rsquo;d be seeing on the floor is not 100 fold off like was asserted. Maybe it&rsquo;s off to the degree it&rsquo;s more like a blend of NBA mixed with Euroleague and G league all in one. Maybe. That&rsquo;s my own inference and is only just that - an inference. but at least I&rsquo;m doing some math to get to it and not just throwing out a 1/100th number like I was responding to.</p>
