<p>So I started a new video series that takes a close look at NBA history and tries to add context so we can appreciate the value of historical players skill and abilities and not make the same mistakes JJ Redick made, casually writing them off without context. Currently I&rsquo;m working on episode 3 which will be about Willis Reed but this is the second episode of the series. The structure of the game was different back then and few people, recent NBA players included, seem to realize how different it was. I don&rsquo;t see a lot of videos or people really diving into that topic and I feel it needs to be clarified or players in the past often get mislabeled as unskilled or inefficient when actually a lot of them were literally the opposite given what they were allowed to do - the rules were just so drastically different our expectations are out of touch. Hopefully this, and future videos will help shape an appreciation for past NBA legends such as Dolph Schayes.</p>

He was a player-coach of the 76ers when the nats moved to philly, but after that, he was a syracuse mainstay. i&rsquo;ve talked to a couple people who remember him, he was very involved with the jewish community in central new york, they said he was kind and gracious. he died in 2015</p>

<p>Schayes&rsquo; son is retired NBA center Danny Schayes, who played in the NBA for 18 seasons. His granddaughters Abi, Carla, and Rachel Goettsch won silver medals for the United States volleyball team at the 2001 Maccabiah Games, and his grandson Mickey Ferri won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 2005 Maccabiah Games.</p>

<p>We have tape. I don’t know how anybody can watch the tape in this video and come to the conclusion that players from the 1950s and 1960s had comparable skill sets/athleticism. Rule differences aside, look at their shooting forms, their defensive positioning, their touch at the rim, their understanding of space. No modern rule change is going to help any of that.</p>

<p>It’s just insulting to modern players really. It’s not hyperbole to assume that JJ put in more hours of practice and training in 2 years than most 1950s NBA players did in their entire careers. Professional athletes didn’t train the way people do now. And the talent pool was 1% the size. It’s just straight up insane to pretend like there’s been no progression in the sport.</p>

You are acting like if Schayes or any other old player was born or played now they would automatically suck, when they would have access to everything JJ did. You aren&rsquo;t making a fair comparison. I&rsquo;m not saying Schayes, directly teleported from his era, would be as good as a modern player. You are acting like if he was a modern player, born in say 1990 or something, he would FOR SURE suck. That&rsquo;s not fair and you don&rsquo;t KNOW that just by looking at tape like you are implying.</p>

<p>No, I’m literally doing the opposite of that. I have no idea how good he would be if he was born today. It’s insane to pretend that anybody could know that.</p>

<p>Im talking about how he <em>actually</em> played. We have tape of that. Anything else is speculation. I am talking about teleporting him today. So is any other rational person.</p>

<p>It’s obvious to anybody who has touched a basketball that if you dropped anybody from these clips into the modern NBA, they would be lost.</p>

      <label for="l9n1o8p" class="commentText"><p>Today there are 450 roster spots and back then there were as few as 80-100.</p>

<p>50 million kids growing up in America had played with a basketball at some point in their childhood and had a chance to learn the game leading up to the generation that stocked the NBA in Dolph Schayes time which only had room for 80-100 players at any given time. 1 in every half million to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of a million people who touched a basketball back then ended up playing in the NBA.</p>

<p>Today, let&rsquo;s say a billion kids grew up to stock the NBA of what we see today but there are 450 spots available That number is one in every 2 to 2.2 million. Sounds like a huge difference right?</p>

<p>Well, 1 in every 40,000 people who touch a basketball become collegiate players today and I often hear people say high school or college players and teams today are on par with past NBA players and that statistic of rarity alone should prove that that isn&rsquo;t true. being 1 among every 500-700 million is much closer to the modern NBA ratio of 1 among 2.2 million than it is to being 1 among 40,000.</p>

<p>G league plus Euroleeague plus NBA combined is actually about identical in ratio to the razors edge of elite that NBA basketball was back even in Dolph Schayes time. And I may be mistaken but those are arguably the 3 top leagues on the planet even today. The world of basketball players today certainly grew. But so did the amount of roster spots and places you could go at to play at a top level.</p>

<p>In other words, from the vantage point of any fan, or even high level players that made it through a modern college program - any NBA player even back in the 1950&rsquo;s should be treated as a razors edge of basketball talent and ability because that&rsquo;s exactly what they were, and still would be considered today. If they look weird or awkward - I personally believe a lot of that is due to the rules as much as anything else. The inference that they are worse because of a smaller sample size shouldn&rsquo;t overlook that the size of the league was also scaled accordingly with a smaller league in that era.</p>

      <label for="l9n4omj" class="commentText"><p>This doesn’t make sense. Thats to get in the nba. If you have 450 spots you have 450 players who can show they are more talented and not cut off as many people in the process. 450 vying for the top 15 that make all nba versus 80. Not to mention all the genetic aberrations who make it in with the far greater population numbers of today. You just can’t compare eras, but if you actually moved a 1950s player into the league today they would get smacked. Theres just no way around it.</p>

      <label for="l9n7d3w" class="commentText"><p>To dominate the NBA the ratio I just talked about still doesn&rsquo;t appreciably change.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>In 1960 out of 99 total players, 13 players averaged over 20ppg
In 2024 out of 572 total players (more than I thought), 38 players averaged over 20ppg and probably there should be more here but I bet a few didn&rsquo;t make basketball reference list due to players not meeting the game count. Players today sit more to rest on injuries vs in the past players just played through them and I think that knocks a few modern guys off the leaderboards. But it&rsquo;s all near as makes little difference the same as what I just explained.</p>

<p>To be an NBA player back then is really about as rare and elite as it is to be in one of the top 3 leagues on the planet today and to be an elite NBA player back then would put you in the same class as elite players today.</p>

<p>The genetic anomoly thing isn&rsquo;t even relevant here, the longest armspans, tallest heights, most agile or strong types of players you see today - if you become familiar with players who played in the past you&rsquo;d know they existed back then to. Of course there&rsquo;s always unique players playing today. But the same was true then. Who today is built like Wilt? Anyone? Who EVER was? You can say the same about many players from any era. You can name more names as the league and talent pool increases. But remember, back then, the league shrank along with the talent pool.</p>

<p>Dolph was a stretch big/wing 30 years before the 3pt line existed. </p>

      <label for="l9micbx" class="commentText"><p>I didn’t say that. I’m only trying to highlight what makes Dolph Schayes so great/skilled with some insight into the rules in place during his time - which i think not enough people talk about thus we end up with a lot of fans and even former players like JJ discussing a player like Dolph in away that he’s unable to understand or appreciate his abilities</p>

      <label for="l9n59o2" class="commentText"><p>It’s just funny that JJ Redick of all people was the one to say that because if he was teleported to the 50’s and was a HOF he would be the poster child for people pointing out that the NBA back then was so weak that even short unathletic white guys could dominate.</p>

<p>That being said, I think the 6’8” Schayes would hold his own against Redick, except for maybe the season where he got injured and played most of the season in a cast.</p>
