</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This quality off-season post is the product of a 1994 Ron Harper basketball card—the 1994-95 Topps Finest.</p>

<p>Looking at this card recently, Harper is photographed wearing a #2 Bulls jersey. #2? I grew up in the ‘90s religiously watching the Bulls whenever they were on my television &amp; have 0 recollection of him ever wearing #2. I’ve watched enough highlights of MJs return during the final quarter of so of the 1994-95 season to have seen Harp in #9 during those games. Next, headed over to Harper’s Basketball Reference page… sure enough, in his history of numbers worn, never #2.</p>

<p>I was able to find other photos of Harper wearing #2 on a handful of different basketball cards from 1994-95 series to know that Topps didn’t arbitrarily photoshop Ron into #2 on their Finest card.</p>

<p>My next bit of research led me to my answer &amp; something I was unfamiliar with… what Norm Van Lier referred to as, ‘Van Lier Voodoo’. Unhappy that the Bulls retired Jerry Sloan’s number, and not Van Lier’s #2 along with Sloan, Norm put a curse on the #2.</p>

<p>From a Chicago Tribune article prior to the 1996-97 season:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ron Harper didn’t know the curse had a name, only that there was something strange about the number. Randy Brown didn’t know the curse had a name, either. He didn’t even know there was a curse until somebody kindly informed him.
Something about the No. 2 being a jinx. Brown, who wore No. 0 last season, immediately switched to No. 1. He wasn’t taking any chances.
“Before I even put it on, I felt bad,” Brown said. “When they found out what number I was going to wear, they were looking at me like I had some kind of a disease. Right then and there, I felt kind of nervous.”
Norm Van Lier likes to call it the “Van Lier Voodoo.” Apparently, Van Lier put some sort of hex on the number when he left the Bulls in 1978. Dennis Hopson wore it and had bad luck. Brad Sellers wore it and had bad luck. Harper wore it for three preseason games his first season with the Bulls. He ditched it, too, after having a chat with Sellers, Hopson and Scottie Pippen.
“Pip made me change it,” Harper said with a grin. “Dennis and Brad mentioned something too. That’s all I have to say about it. I don’t want to say anything else about it.”</p>

<p>Now there’s this belief that Van Lier put a curse on the number because he felt it should be retired.
“I put the `Van Lier Voodoo’ on it,” he said. “Dennis Hopson? I can just leave it at that. What did he ever do? Brad Sellers? I like Brad, but no comment. I just don’t think anybody should be wearing it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After discovering the curse Van Lier put on the #2 Bulls uniform, is he to blame for Lonzo’s injury woes? Sure, he had missed a significant amount of time in his 4 seasons prior to arriving in Chicago, but he’d never missed half of 1 season, let alone over straight 2.5 seasons!</p>
