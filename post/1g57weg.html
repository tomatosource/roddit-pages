<p>Well yeah, but vastly more people do so when it’s not only legal but incredibly easy to access to anyone with a vaguely modern smartphone, which is damn near everyone.</p>

<p>Doesn’t help that not only is sports betting plastered in every other advertisement, and in every talking head show on every network, but it also happens during the actual sport in question, and even in the fucking <em>commentary</em> sometimes.</p>

<p>We’re absolutely inundated with this garbage and it’s ruining lives and even resulting in verbal abuse and death threats towards certain players who didn’t produce enough for the degenerate gamblers.</p>

Is the criminal justice process for some types of low-risk drug possession and use wildly out of date and in need of reform? Absolutely. Have priorities been way out of whack for entirely too long? Without a doubt. But there are way too many people acting like allowing people to possess and use hard narcotics and more dangerous shit without any criminal consequences is a good idea than I think should be.</p>

<p>What we’re witnessing right now is a replay of the opioid crisis, but with gambling instead of oxycontin. We can scream free will all we want, but the mathematical reality is there is a subset of the population at higher risk of gambling addiction, that will become gambling addicts due to this reckless exposure.</p>

They compare it to how criminalizing drugs meant that addicts and users were being incarcerated for smoking pot. That&rsquo;s a terrible argument. It&rsquo;s not the same thing at all. Find me one person in prison today who is there because they were convicted of illegal gambling. There are none because no one was prosecuting that. What was illegal and being prosecuted was the operation of gambling ventures. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve legalized. In the previous regime, we weren&rsquo;t punishing the heroin addicts, we were only punishing the large drug dealers inflicting the harm.</p>

<p>I think you mean decriminalization, not legalization. I don&rsquo;t know if people are seriously advocating for cocaine and meth to be legally sold at their local bodega. But what they are saying is that the way to deal with addiction is a psychological/medical model, not a jail sentence.</p>

<p>The best way to handle vices like gambling is decriminalization (no need to punish the the drug user, gambler, or sex worker, but don&rsquo;t institutionalize those activities), not legalizing and shoving the addictive/destructive vice down your throat at every turn.  It&rsquo;s a disgusting argument to rationalize hyper-capitalism.</p>

<p>First, that there is a certain subset of sports fans who are going to bet on games legal or not. If that&rsquo;s the case, following his logic that sounds a lot like harm reduction for drug use, the sensible solution would be to decriminalize sports betting. That would make it safer for that subset of sports fans that are going to bet regardless, and since his argument implies that sports betting is harmful (and he makes a half-assed acknowledgement of the harm), we shouldn&rsquo;t try to encourage more bettors by legalizing and advertising.</p>

<p>Second though, if he&rsquo;s implying that nearly everyone will bet on sports legal or illegal, then why the fuck would sports betting companies need to advertise so heavily if everyone&rsquo;s going to bet regardless of legal status (except to steal bettors away from your competitors of course, but if that were the only goal, those ads would look very different).</p>

<p>It should be patently obvious to anyone with two brain cells to rub together that he wanted to legalize sports betting because he knew the NBA would make a fuck ton of money off of it. Nobody should be publishing his clearly insincere reasoning.</p>

<p>Well, with the advent of the internet and widely available sports watching online &hellip;. people are finding ways to stream NBA games illegally.</p>

<p>Does this mean Silver is planning to make all NBA games easier to watch for free without a subscription?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think those who propagate and promote it will eventually feel some kind of remorse but that is too much to happen.</p>

<p>There is a twisted side of me that wants all the bad things to happen, like corruption and throwing games, and for that to eventually destroy the NBA&hellip;because otherwise I don&rsquo;t see how it would ever go back.</p>

<p>You act like that&rsquo;s a recent phenomenon. That is nothing new.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well yeah, but vastly more people do so when it’s not only legal but incredibly easy to access to anyone with a vaguely modern smartphone, which is damn near everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really convinced by this argument. I don&rsquo;t think that online access has any effect on problem gambling, it just gives more people access. If anything it makes it easier to stop, because all you have to do is close the app or website. The problem gambling thing is a major argument for the movement to ban online poker, but every statistic has shown in that case that it is significantly easier for addicts to stop when playing online than it is in person at casinos, because if you already at the casino, are you really gonna leave just because you lost the 100 bucks you told yourself was your limit in the first hour, or are you gonna head to the ATM? The disparity probably isn&rsquo;t as big with sports betting, but I still don&rsquo;t think online is an issue at all. Something that&rsquo;s that convenient to use is just as convenient to stop using.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t help that not only is sports betting plastered in every other advertisement, and in every talking head show on every network</p>

<p>That, I will grant you, is really annoying. They should probably have some regulations about it the same way they do beer advertisements, if they don&rsquo;t already.</p>

With gambling, there is no victim, or if there is one, its the person voluntarily putting their money down. With streaming, the victim is the NBA itself. And they could absolutely provide it for free and make tons of money through advertising. However they make more money with the present system by selling the broadcast rights to networks, who have contracts with cable companies, and broadcasting it for free would make all that go away.</p>

<p>Gambling addiction is one of the worst, certain personalities especially highly competitive people who are more enticed in sports are more susceptible. It ruins you, the amount of money these companies are making is crazy and their profit margins are crazy too. They can outbid nearly all other advertisers solely because of how much they profit. It’s so lucrative now as online gambling is easily accessible these companies have been able to nearly pay off the whole sports world. It’s absolutely everywhere.</p>

<p>Knowing all this I was still addicted, there needs to be more awareness about it and be less stigmatised. They use physcology and techniques to keep you there and optimise it so you stay addicted.</p>

<p>This is absolutely true. decriminalizing it helps to remove the stigma. They need to have some regulation about the advertising definitely, and also maybe the margins they are allowed to set on prop bets and the like to ensure they aren&rsquo;t predatory. But banning gambling again serves no one.</p>

      <label for="ls93ydd" class="commentText"><p>Sports betting is ruining the actual fan experience. Even commentators are talking about odds and spreads now. It is destroying the actual experience of watching games, to say nothing of the broader more significant damage the industry does. It’s sad and pathetic to see sports “journalists” now covering gambling lines and shilling for the bookmakers. The most pathetic is seeing local press and commentators do it on their shows, in their articles or in their podcasts. It’s a low integrity move to promote it, and for any “journalist” is borderline unethical to shape reporting around it</p>

<p>I can actually agree with legalization if it means zero TV advertisement, lock people out of their gambling accounts when they exceed certain limits etc.</p>

<p>Broader gambling always lead to social problems, so legalizing + setting limits can be a way to deal with it.</p>

      <label for="lsd0t9y" class="commentText"><p>Reading these comments makes me think:</p>

<p>Am I really the only one that enjoys gambling on sports and doesn’t have any problem with it?</p>

<p>I don’t think I could watch regular season basketball without gambling - there’s 82 games where 16 of the 30 teams ultimately make the playoffs and with the play-ins 20 of the 30 teams have a shot….
Only way for the games to have any meaning or entertainment for me is by putting a few bucks on them.</p>

<p>Some people ruin their lives with it - and hell, I’ve certainly gone overboard and learned some lessons on impulse control at times.</p>

<p>But people ruin their lives with problem shopping, overeating, drinking too much, overworking.</p>

<p>At some point people need to take personal responsibility instead of finding someone to blame…. Blaming sportsbooks and casinos for your gambling addiction is like blaming Nike for your shopping addiction or like blaming McDonalds for eating addiction.</p>

<p>They’re businesses, their job is to find customers and make money. You’re a consumer - you get to decide if and how much to spend at their business.</p>
