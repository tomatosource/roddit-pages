<p>Well yeah, but vastly more people do so when it’s not only legal but incredibly easy to access to anyone with a vaguely modern smartphone, which is damn near everyone.</p>

<p>Doesn’t help that not only is sports betting plastered in every other advertisement, and in every talking head show on every network, but it also happens during the actual sport in question, and even in the fucking <em>commentary</em> sometimes.</p>

<p>We’re absolutely inundated with this garbage and it’s ruining lives and even resulting in verbal abuse and death threats towards certain players who didn’t produce enough for the degenerate gamblers.</p>

      <label for="ls96l2i" class="commentText"><p>People don&rsquo;t want to hear this, but legalizing all recreational drug use is a better analogy. Is the criminal justice process for some types of low-risk drug possession and use wildly out of date and in need of reform? Absolutely. Have priorities been way out of whack for entirely too long? Without a doubt. But there are way too many people acting like allowing people to possess and use hard narcotics and more dangerous shit without any criminal consequences is a good idea than I think should be.</p>

      <label for="ls99ofs" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d be fine with greater drug legalization if society was improved - it&rsquo;s established that addiction comes about when people have socioeconomic hardships. The problem is no one wants to address that, meaning mass legalization in the current system would result in the same 20% addiction rate.</p>

      <label for="ls9721i" class="commentText"><p>Ya, if we&rsquo;re to accept his argument that we should legalize it because people are going to find a way to bet regardless, then we&rsquo;re left with two possible logical conclusions.</p>

<p>First, that there is a certain subset of sports fans who are going to bet on games legal or not. If that&rsquo;s the case, following his logic that sounds a lot like harm reduction for drug use, the sensible solution would be to decriminalize sports betting. That would make it safer for that subset of sports fans that are going to bet regardless, and since his argument implies that sports betting is harmful (and he makes a half-assed acknowledgement of the harm), we shouldn&rsquo;t try to encourage more bettors by legalizing and advertising.</p>

<p>Second though, if he&rsquo;s implying that nearly everyone will bet on sports legal or illegal, then why the fuck would sports betting companies need to advertise so heavily if everyone&rsquo;s going to bet regardless of legal status (except to steal bettors away from your competitors of course, but if that were the only goal, those ads would look very different).</p>

<p>It should be patently obvious to anyone with two brain cells to rub together that he wanted to legalize sports betting because he knew the NBA would make a fuck ton of money off of it. Nobody should be publishing his clearly insincere reasoning.</p>

<p>Gambling addiction is one of the worst, certain personalities especially highly competitive people who are more enticed in sports are more susceptible. It ruins you, the amount of money these companies are making is crazy and their profit margins are crazy too. They can outbid nearly all other advertisers solely because of how much they profit. It’s so lucrative now as online gambling is easily accessible these companies have been able to nearly pay off the whole sports world. It’s absolutely everywhere.</p>

<p>Knowing all this I was still addicted, there needs to be more awareness about it and be less stigmatised. They use physcology and techniques to keep you there and optimise it so you stay addicted.</p>

It’s sad and pathetic to see sports “journalists” now covering gambling lines and shilling for the bookmakers. The most pathetic is seeing local press and commentators do it on their shows, in their articles or in their podcasts. It’s a low integrity move to promote it, and for any “journalist” is borderline unethical to shape reporting around it</p>

      <label for="ls94rux" class="commentText"><p>There was an article in The Athletic this week about a guy who lost a parlay because a player made a three when the game was already out of reach and that caused him to lose the over/under.  He went on Instagram looking for the player to scream at him.</p>

<p>You have to wonder how long it will be until someone loses a bet and does something worse.</p>

<p>These leagues are courting disaster!</p>
