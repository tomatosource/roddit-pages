      <label for="lcf7ino" class="commentText"><p>When you&rsquo;re the level of athlete that these guys are, it&rsquo;s easy to recognize and appreciate the greatness in others at the top of their respective events. That&rsquo;s one reason why the Olympics is still such a special experience even if it&rsquo;s essentially a guaranteed medal for the US. It&rsquo;s not like they have much time during their season to see greatness up close in other sports, and there&rsquo;s no other environment where you&rsquo;ll experience so much of it in one place. And that&rsquo;s not even touching on the global/cultural nature of why it&rsquo;s a special two weeks for them.</p>

She is the most decorated gymnast in world championship history, and has been for the last 5 years and is still winning. She has gone to a championship event and won literally every event she competed in. Lebron isn&rsquo;t even the goat of his own sport.</p>

<p>e: lemme add that I wouldnt argue with anyone preferring Phelps. Thats a legitimate debate imo. But Lebron is not in the same as these two.</p>

      <label for="lcfx4di" class="commentText"><p>I would not consider Tiger this generation, personally.</p>

<p>Re Phelps, the general argument is that the variety of skills Biles needs to be dominant in her various areas (all around, floor exercises, vault, balance beam, uneven bars), is more than it takes Phelps to be dominant at his areas (butterfly, freestyle). Again, if someone wants to prefer Phelps, I&rsquo;m ok with it. I don&rsquo;t agree but I get the argument.</p>

He has been at the top of his sport for 20 years. That man could be made in a lab, there just wont be another Lebron in terms of his athleticism</p>

      <label for="lcfw1r4" class="commentText"><p>I think lebron is quite clearly the best nba player of his generation. But longevity accomplishments are not in the same category imo as going out and beating the best competitors in the world, event after event, year after year. he has not accomplished the level of dominance over his opponents that Biles has. I don&rsquo;t mind anyone preferring Phelps to Biles. I wouldn&rsquo;t spend effort arguing that. But there are levels, and both Biles and Phelps are a tier above Lebron.</p>

      <label for="lcf3y2h" class="commentText"><p>Facts. When Simone withdrew from several events at the last Olympics due to her &ldquo;twisties&rdquo; (she ultimately retuned to secure a bronze medal in the balance beam individual event), I immediately looked up online to see if there were any notable cases of Gymnasts getting paralyzed and I found this <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ougjxj/til_soviet_gymnast_elena_mukhina_widely_touted_as/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">sad tragic case</a> of the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Mukhina" target="_blank">Elena Mukhina</a>, a gymnast for the Soviet Union who won the Individual All-Around title at the 1978 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships (she won an additional 2 Gold Medals &amp; two Silver medals at the 1978 Worlds).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Mukhina" target="_blank">Elena Mukhina</a> was widely touted as the next great gymnastics star until 1979 when she broke a leg and missed several competitions, including the 1979 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Despite the injury, she was still considered a lock/favorite to make the Soviet Union&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Gymnastics team for the 1980 Summer Olympics, which were being held on home soil in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mikhail Klimenko, Elena&rsquo;s personal coach, rushed her recovery from her leg injury and forced her to return to return to training early so she could make the Olympic Team, despite Elena begging him and the Soviet Union Olympic doctors to not remove her cast because she knew that her leg wasn&rsquo;t fully healed.</p>

<p>The combination of her coach rushing her recovery from her leg injury, her coach&rsquo;s desire/ambition to become known as the &ldquo;Olympic champion&rsquo;s trainer&rdquo; (The Soviet Union were the heavy favorite to win (which they ultimately achieved) the Women&rsquo;s Gymnastics team event), &amp; the pressure she felt to perform a dangerous move (the Thomas salto, a move that has since been deemed a Banned Element for both Men&rsquo;s &amp; Women&rsquo;s Gymnastics), ultimately caused Elena to break her neck in a practice session TWO WEEKS BEFORE The opening ceremony of the Moscow Olympics, leaving her a lifelong quadriplegic.</p>

<p>Elena herself even revealed in an <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/who-is-elena-mukhina/" target="_blank">interview years later</a> that her first immediate thought as she lay on the floor with her neck severely broken was, &ldquo;Thank God, I won&rsquo;t be going to the Olympics!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elena Mukhina eventually died around Christmas 2006, at the age of 46 due to complications from quadriplegia as a result of her accident in that practice session in 1980.</p>

<p>In addition to the links I included while summing up the story of Elena Mukhina in this comment, there are several videos on YouTube detailing &amp; breaking down Elena&rsquo;s tragic story.</p>

      <label for="lcfdskp" class="commentText"><p>If you need an exact money match for a comparison then I’m in trouble because I don’t believe any female athlete makes tens of millions.</p>

<p>But let’s say an NFL player who made the exact same amount of money as Biles checked out of the Super Bowl early for safety/mental health reasons, he’d be roasted too.</p>

      <label for="lcfldq4" class="commentText"><p>College athletes check out for bowl games or even chunks of seasons once they’ve secured their draft positions because they don’t want to risk their health for free. I imagine it would be viewed similarly which is largely not an issue.</p>

<p>Also no nfl players play for free, so again it’s not a good comparison. They have  union that mandates a minimum salary.</p>

<p>I think Biles makes all her money from endorsements, which would obviously end the moment her ability to compete does.</p>

      <label for="lcflk78" class="commentText"><p>Totally agree that the bowl skipping could be an equivalent. The problem though, is they’re preparing for a bigger stage. For Simone this was the biggest stage in her sport. Even the Super Bowl doesn’t do it justice because that happens every year.</p>

      <label for="lcfmvmu" class="commentText"><p>I guess if the US wants athletes to be more willing to risk their health for personal/national glory they should provide for them if/when they get injured doing so.</p>

<p>So long as they are competing for free + endorsements, anyone coming at them for being soft or whatever for prioritizing their health and long term careers is just being kind of a dick.</p>
