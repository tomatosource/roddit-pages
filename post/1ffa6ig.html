    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I used to hear the NBA media community constantly talk about a mythical &ldquo;Double draft&rdquo; where players forced to go to college by the one and done rule would be in a same draft with the first crop of high schoolers allowed back into the NBA since 2005 but that&rsquo;s really died down. I did some googling and I got zilch so has there been something I missed?</p>

      <label for="lmts4wr" class="commentText"><p>I mean isn’t it like significantly less though? Cooper Flagg is the highest paid NIL basketball player with 1.5 mil according to what I found online but Wemby is making over 10 mil a year on his rookie deal not including his signing bonus. It still seems like a pretty significant gap between the two to where I feel like money shouldn’t be competitive</p>

      <label for="lmtsoc7" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but that&rsquo;s wemby/kg/Kobe, not your average high schooler NBA prospect.  Someone like kwame brown would have taken the NBA contract under all circumstances due to family/poverty, but he would have been better off spending a year making $250k and not having to deal with MJ being a huge asshole, and he at least would have been able to pay moms rent.</p>

      <label for="lmwrkna" class="commentText"><p>The rookie salaries are fixed. Any number 1 pick makes 10M. The fixed salary for the 30th pick is 2M. If Cooper Flag had come to the NBA and gotten drafted this year at pick 30 (likely would have been 1)  then he still makes more than he does with NIL.</p>

      <label for="lmt75mv" class="commentText"><p>The one and done rule was created for the benefit of the franchises as they were having too much trouble accurately scouting high schoolers and teams wasted a ton of high picks on trash players.</p>

<p>Scouting has undoubtedly gotten better since then but teams still aren’t eager to roll the dice on high school players outside of obvious exceptions like wemby</p>

      <label for="lmt7kmf" class="commentText"><p>The league realized they didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> want it to go away because it gives a free year of scouting and advertising players as future stars, and also gives more protection to owners because high school stars will get exposed in college typically so they&rsquo;re not drafting utter busts that don&rsquo;t even do anything in college.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why after a decade of talking about removing the one and done rule, they suddenly came up with the idea of Ignite and the G-League.</p>

      <label for="lmt9y37" class="commentText"><p>I think teams like it and it&rsquo;s working well. Realistically, most players would end up in the G-League anyway, so would not benefit from development at the NBA level. For teams, they get kids that had at least a year of living away from home and working in a properly coached environment on a team of peer or near-peers. I think maturity aspect was a big problem when NBA teams were drafting highschoolers.</p>

Players may morally support it, but In the CBA negotiations they don&rsquo;t push for it since it just adds more competition for roster spots. NBA teams are happy to have an extra year of scouting/development on the NCAAs dime.</p>

But Bronny wasn’t good enough to do that and Bron has held off being washed longer than expected, and I haven’t really anything about the rule since.</p>
