</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m sure plenty of other people have asked this before but now that the new season is looming over us and I have really gotten into basketball in the last few months I&rsquo;ve decided that I will follow the NBA next season and I am looking for which team to support.</p>

<p>Little information about me: I&rsquo;m from Europe but when choosing a team time zone is not that big of a deal. In football (or soccer) I support Arsenal and in ice hockey I follow Rangers and Lightning. In basketball I (for whatever reason) mostly enjoy watching teams that drive to the basket/paint and have a big emphasis on an inside play instead of only (or in majority of times) just throwing three pointers, so playstyle like that would be a big plus. I would like a team that is already good but not a team that has just last season won a championship or who has a recent dynasty (for example I dont want to support Warrior or Celtics). Its also a plus if the team has &ldquo;rich&rdquo; history.</p>

<p>The teams I would mostly be interested in are:
Mavericks
Timberwolves
Thunder
Denver
Knicks
Bucks
Pacers
Magics
Raptors (Even if they dont fit the being good right now category I would also be interested in them since its the only Canadian team)</p>

<p>What team out of these would you guys be able to recommend (or is there some other team that fits better?) based on the little info I provided and if you are a fan of one of these teams what would be the pros and cons?</p>

      <label for="lnbvd1i" class="commentText"><p>The Mavs have a pretty good euro player, and their best of all time was also a euro. that&rsquo;d be a good choice i think. Kinda hard to watch games due to the time zone difference</p>
