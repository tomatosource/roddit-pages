<p>His athleticism and shot creation intertwined in the most beautiful way. An absolute freak of nature and his 76ers days in particular aren’t talked about enough because that organization did a horrible job of building around him.</p>

      <label for="loja56g" class="commentText"><p>Chuck led the league in TS% four seasons straight, and for his career he’s still in the top 20.</p>

<p>This is despite the fact that he couldn’t hit threes and wasn’t a great FT shooter (73.5% for his career). He also wasn’t a giant who just stood under the rim like the DeAndre Jordans and Rudy Goberts who feature highly on these lists.</p>

<p>Twos from the field, Chuck just didn’t miss those very often, and they weren’t all dunks either. It’s funny to me how they had to change the back to the basket rule because he was impossible to fucking move (and to promote more continuous play, but hey, not like everyone was able to do it).</p>

      <label for="lojlhpq" class="commentText"><p>^ perfect example of what was going thru my mind about Charles recently. Disclaimer, Barkley is one of my favorite retro players ever and my favorite analyst, so don’t think I’m a hater</p>

<p>But I don’t think people here realize how much his reputation is buoyed by being a likeable jokester on TNT.</p>

<p>He 100% reached a bigger peak than Zion, but outside that, every criticism that’s leveled on Zion can be leveled at him too. He was drafted on a team with 2 HOFs and fucked it up by getting intentionally fat and out of shape. He had an MVP season with suns, and even then, was known league wide as a lazy and disinterested defender. He left his prime early cuz of contract disputes and being out of shape all the time.</p>

<p>I’m not saying “everyone should shit on chuck”. But embiid has done maybe half this bad stuff, is even more dominant as a player empirically, and is known league wide as a bum choker who should be shat on. I love chuck, but embiid fans, for example, should take heart in the fact that all these criticisms will dissappear if you make good jokes on the halftime show</p>

<p>I don’t want people to shit on Barkley - my point is that the guys were dumping on so much right now, the guys that are being named in this thread and others as “they’ll never be like Barkley”, when the aura of nostalgia comes into play, their legacies won’t seem as bad as you guys are trying to make it rn. People saying tatums legacy is shot cuz brown won FMVP or saying embiid is the most fraud MVP of all time or saying Luka is a bum who pads stats and never defends a soul - if those dudes lived in the 90s they’d be eating chuck alive</p>

<p>He got Andrew Toney injured? Toney was the main reason PHI fell off. He was the Celtics-killer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of us (Celtics) could stop him. With the exception of Michael Jordan, I have never been more afraid of an opponent at the shooting guard position than Andrew Toney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>-Larry Bird</p>

<p>But Toney played through injury (stress fractures in both feet) which ended his career prematurely.</p>

<p>Blaming Barkley for that is like blaming Embiid for Ben Simmons.</p>

The fact about Zion is he’s fat and he’s not as good as he was supposed to be. Just because he has a few highlights in a play-in game (that he lost) doesn’t make him better than Barkley, who is an MVP 11x all-NBA, and led the league in rebounding. Zion will be lucky if he can achieve 1% of what Barkley did</p>

<p>Chuck has become such a huge and famous personality that it seems people genuinely forget he was an absolute phenom - right behind MJ for the greatest of era, to me. In fact, put him on a better team for his prime and you have to wonder if his whole narrative isn&rsquo;t completely changed. Those touch the back dunks were always the most satisfying - love watching that dude play.</p>
