<p>His athleticism and shot creation intertwined in the most beautiful way. An absolute freak of nature and his 76ers days in particular aren’t talked about enough because that organization did a horrible job of building around him.</p>

      <label for="loja56g" class="commentText"><p>Chuck led the league in TS% four seasons straight, and for his career he’s still in the top 20.</p>

<p>This is despite the fact that he couldn’t hit threes and wasn’t a great FT shooter (73.5% for his career). He also wasn’t a giant who just stood under the rim like the DeAndre Jordans and Rudy Goberts who feature highly on these lists.</p>

<p>Twos from the field, Chuck just didn’t miss those very often, and they weren’t all dunks either. It’s funny to me how they had to change the back to the basket rule because he was impossible to fucking move (and to promote more continuous play, but hey, not like everyone was able to do it).</p>

<p>But I don’t think people here realize how much his reputation is buoyed by being a likeable jokester on TNT.</p>

<p>He 100% reached a bigger peak than Zion, but outside that, every criticism that’s leveled on Zion can be leveled at him too. He was drafted on a team with 2 HOFs and fucked it up by getting intentionally fat and out of shape. He had an MVP season with suns, and even then, was known league wide as a lazy and disinterested defender. He left his prime early cuz of contract disputes and being out of shape all the time.</p>

<p>I’m not saying “everyone should shit on chuck”. But embiid has done maybe half this bad stuff, is even more dominant as a player empirically, and is known league wide as a bum choker who should be shat on. I love chuck, but embiid fans, for example, should take heart in the fact that all these criticisms will dissappear if you make good jokes on the halftime show</p>

<p>I don’t want people to shit on Barkley - my point is that the guys were dumping on so much right now, the guys that are being named in this thread and others as “they’ll never be like Barkley”, when the aura of nostalgia comes into play, their legacies won’t seem as bad as you guys are trying to make it rn. People saying tatums legacy is shot cuz brown won FMVP or saying embiid is the most fraud MVP of all time or saying Luka is a bum who pads stats and never defends a soul - if those dudes lived in the 90s they’d be eating chuck alive</p>

<p>Chuck was a perennial all-NBA player and MVP contender from his second season on.  The Sixers not winning with him had absolutely nothing to do with <em>his</em> play.</p>

<p>The Zion criticisms are warranted. Yes Charles was fat. But that didn&rsquo;t stop him from playing, unlike Zion.</p>

<p>The Embiid criticisms are less warranted but still justifiable since he hasn&rsquo;t really put together any kind of decent post-season until last year. If he makes ECF this year, there will be fewer haters.</p>

<p>He got Andrew Toney injured? Toney was the main reason PHI fell off. He was the Celtics-killer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of us (Celtics) could stop him. With the exception of Michael Jordan, I have never been more afraid of an opponent at the shooting guard position than Andrew Toney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>-Larry Bird</p>

<p>But Toney played through injury (stress fractures in both feet) which ended his career prematurely.</p>

<p>Blaming Barkley for that is like blaming Embiid for Ben Simmons.</p>

<p>But your example at the end makes my point exactly. People ABSOLUTELY blame embiid regardless of Simmons fuckups. These same people would definitely blame Barkley regardless of Toney’s injuries.</p>

<p>Embiid has played with washed up harden and bum Tobias Harris has his two costars for most of his MVP prime, but rn nobody gives one fuck. If Barkley was playing today, he’d be eating shit for coming in fat to an existing champ team with 2 HOFs, and nobody would say that the sixers third option was the real reason so Barkleys off the hook for this</p>

      <label for="lojyqld" class="commentText"><p>God I hate the comparison with today&rsquo;s league. If you watched Open Court you heard that the league back then was basically you&rsquo;re up to your own. Nowadays it&rsquo;s very, very different. One of Jokic&rsquo;s rare interviews early in his career (it was in Serbian) he said the life in the NBA is easy because all you gotta do is use your limbs. Someone tells you when to wake up, when to go and where to go, they serve you food you need to eat, give you supplements, give you meds to rest properly, tell you to go chill for a while then call you again for more practice, meals, workouts. And he said the teams have that nailed down to a science.</p>

<p>That did not exist in 1985. Not to mention he was a poor kid from Alabama who just made money to do whatever he wanted.</p>

<p>Athleticism, handle , finishing etc . Zion is clearly better by eye test.</p>

<p>Shoutout to the older generation of nba players they paved the way for the game today and their legacy’s stand for their accomplishments vs their own competition but todays players are definitely better. From the stars to the role players there has been improvement .</p>

      <label for="lojqlq0" class="commentText"><p>My point is you can watch highlights of any player and decide they’re the best in the world. That doesn’t make it true. The fact about Zion is he’s fat and he’s not as good as he was supposed to be. Just because he has a few highlights in a play-in game (that he lost) doesn’t make him better than Barkley, who is an MVP 11x all-NBA, and led the league in rebounding. Zion will be lucky if he can achieve 1% of what Barkley did</p>

<p>out of shape<br>
Injured &amp; Not playing enough games<br>
Not developing a jump shot
Not being a good enough rebounder</p>

<p>These are all fair criticisms. but production wise he is a generational player when is on the court  . He has produced whenever he has played in the nba . In his first 4 years he has averaged :</p>

<p>24ppg on 64% TS</p>

<p>For comparison</p>

<p>Barkley 21 ppg on 63% TS
Lebron 26.7ppg  on  54% TS
Shaq 27ppg on 58% TS</p>

<p>These are 3 of the best paint players of all time. Zion is borderline unguardable when he drives.</p>

<p>They refer to Chuck as 6&rsquo; 4&rdquo; in this clip and he refuses to go up and stand next to other players of similar height like Shaq does.</p>

<p>Chuck has become such a huge and famous personality that it seems people genuinely forget he was an absolute phenom - right behind MJ for the greatest of era, to me. In fact, put him on a better team for his prime and you have to wonder if his whole narrative isn&rsquo;t completely changed. Those touch the back dunks were always the most satisfying - love watching that dude play.</p>

I’m 6’2 and when I met him I basically almost looking eye to eye with him. Chuck was all of 6’4. And for him to be dominating PF that were 6’8 - 6’10 is crazy</p>
