      <p>In 32 games for the Raptors, he’s averaged 22/6/4 on highly efficient shooting. He’s a 6’6 athletic wing who can pretty much do everything on the floor at 23 years of age yet nobody talks about him as a future star. He’s also been really good for team Canada so it’s doubtful this is a fluke. However, Scottie Barnes and even Quickley get way more hype</p>

<p>I honestly don’t really understand it as RJ was the best of the 3 after the trade</p>

<p>Sucking is not tanking. If the team is trying their best to win then it&rsquo;s not tanking.</p>

      <label for="lcscn9c" class="commentText"><p>I feel like you have to differentiate between being a bad team and tanking somehow, then. Sam Hinkie (actual underrated GM) flipped every single quality player on his roster into a metric shitload of young assets and draft picks and then put himself in a position where he could consistently add a top 5-10 pick to his gross dragon hoard of assets. That’s tanking. We’d be tanking if we were making efforts to exchange our few good players for draft picks, trade exceptions, and young prospects. We’re not really doing that, yet. We’re just ass.</p>

      <label for="lcszx1z" class="commentText"><p>Yeah raptors aim is to give more experience to the young core and if they are not going to get a high pick in the draft that’s also ok. Barnes/Barrett/Quickley is a great starting point and there is no real need to tank since getting the same level as those 3 is harder to achieve. Imagine if the raps drafted those 3 players in different years through tanking and they would be in the exact same spot. Generational talent is hard to come by anyways. The only issue I have with the raps is they should’ve tried to be on the wemby sweepstakes last season</p>

Regardless of the team winning or not anyone who watches basketball can clearly see he was much more comfortable in his role being asked to playmake and shoot more. His 3 pt shooting was sensational and idgaf if that&rsquo;s pre season stats. Hitting 3s efficiently in an NBA game is all the same to me. So while I agree his numbers are a little empty as they didn&rsquo;t impact winning. It&rsquo;s clear Toronto is giving RJ his one chance to be an all star caliber player before his prime is over.</p>

<p>The real answer this isn&rsquo;t being discussed is that people just don&rsquo;t want to admit that him and the Knicks weren&rsquo;t a good fit and both are better off without each other lol. They&rsquo;d much rather shit on RJ for some reason&hellip;like this post right here.</p>

      <label for="lcrxhdc" class="commentText"><p>&hellip;yes? Taking less 3s and taking good 2s is exactly why someone&rsquo;s shooting percentages increase in a sustainable way, especially for someone like RJ who is way better at the rim than in the corner. You&rsquo;re also completely diminishing the actual changes he made. Taking 15% less 3s and pull-ups and taking 15% more shots at the rim is a substantial change that indicates sustainable growth in FG%. It&rsquo;s not some insignificant change by 1 or 2%.</p>

<p>His shooting upticks would be unsustainable if he was just taking the same shots he did in NY and simply making more of them. That is an actual hot streak. Not the case here.</p>

      <label for="lcryu8a" class="commentText"><p>…. Except it is the same shots.</p>

<p>RJ could always get to the rim. RJ has always been historically a shit finisher at the rim. RJ in those 32 games was not a shot finisher at the rim. It’s literally that simple.</p>

<p>RJ in the restricted area:</p>

<p>2020 - 53%</p>

<p>2021 - 55%</p>

<p>2022 - 54.9%</p>

<p>2023 - 59%</p>

<p>2024 before he was traded - 57%</p>

<p><strong>2024 last 32 games - 72%</strong></p>

<p>So the growth in FG% is not from the slight differences in shot diet. It’s from having a finishing increase (he also shot 39% from 3 in this same time btw).</p>

<p>He is factually just making more shots than before.</p>

<p>Yes we see the differences in shot diet. But your point would only make sense if the percentages remained the same while volume changed.</p>

<p>That’s not the case. The percentages changed <em>drastically</em> within those 32 games on top of a increase of volume. That is like the definition of a hot streak lmao.</p>

They indicate he&rsquo;s getting more shots in areas which he is efficient. His fg% at the rim in NY was lower because spacing was worse there.</p>

<p>A hot streak means taking shots in the same areas that you usually do but you&rsquo;re making more of them. So same shot diet but higher fg%. You&rsquo;ve literally acknowledged that he has changed both his shot diet and fg%. How is someone on a hot streak if they are scoring better and also completely changing the way they score?</p>

<p>30 games is a big enough sample size to be considered pretty good progress considering the factors.</p>

<p>I mean, Mikal Bridges looked amazing for the Nets last season (27 games) and he regressed hard this season.</p>

<p>He also wasn’t ‘supposedly bad’, he was bad by a lot of metrics and one of the most inconsistent players (and worst high volume scorers) in the league</p>

<p>The reality is that RJ needs to do this for an entire season before people start taking this more seriously</p>

      <label for="lcry3cn" class="commentText"><p>Because Mikal Bridges probably went on an actual hot streak and stopped making the same shots . He also wasn&rsquo;t scouted as a first option until Brooklyn while RJ&rsquo;s scout report hadn&rsquo;t really changed .</p>

<p>RJ literally started taking different shots for the course of 30 games. That&rsquo;s conscious change. If you can focus on all the metrics that made him bad on NY you can&rsquo;t ignore the ones that clearly show he&rsquo;s a different player in TOR lol.</p>

      <label for="lcrzgk2" class="commentText"><p>Bridges didn’t have the same role as he did on the Nets either and he was still on a hot streak, the very same could apply to RJ</p>

<p>All of his percentages went up a lot and he went from 54% TS to 62% TS from a mid season trade with no offseason</p>

<p>I only referenced his old Knicks metrics because you mentioned his Knicks tenure as ‘supposedly bad’ when that wasn’t the case, he was actually bad lol</p>

<p>He could have very well improve in a new environment, I’m not denying that. But Im just saying that people want to see him do it over an entire season to see if it’s legit, I don’t think that’s some crazy harsh criteria</p>

      <label for="lcs05sy" class="commentText"><p>The key is context to the stats. Bridges doing good after being traded and suddenly being an uncounted first option is different than a player consciously attempting more shots in areas where he is efficient, on a team where the spacing is more suitable for him.</p>

<p>Saying &lsquo;he was bad in NY&rsquo; without acknowledging that the fit in NY is bad - which is literally what every criticism of RJ consists of - completely ignores the context of his situation. He&rsquo;s obviously a better player than he ever was in NY if you just look at what he&rsquo;s good at and why it didn&rsquo;t mesh with the NY roster. If every person shitting on RJ acknowledged he was at least a bad fit I wouldn&rsquo;t bother saying anything but no one ever does.</p>

      <label for="lcs1cxl" class="commentText"><p>I mean, he could have just been bad because he wasn’t there yet in NY</p>

<p>Talented players will always find a way to shine through the worst situations/fit and it never clicked for RJ during his Knicks tenure even with all of the opportunity in the world</p>

<p>We could just have different opinions on RJ, but I’m just skeptical of how much of this is a hot steak</p>

<p>His finishing % (0-3 ft) went from 62% to 73% (career high by a landslide). Which would put his finishing on par with guys like SGA and in the realm of someone like Lebron.</p>

<p>All from a mid season trade? And still finishing left?</p>

<p>Again, maybe I’m skeptical but I personally think some regression is due</p>

      <label for="lcqf5tp" class="commentText"><p>RJ gets the ball with momentum a lot in the Raptors system and finishes plays really well when he gets the ball with a small advantage already. He also shot better than usual from 3.</p>

<p>However Quickley and Barnes generally handle the ball and distribute more, and the gap on defense between Barrett and Barnes is huge.</p>

<p>You can make the case that Barrett was better than Quickley for the Raps last season, it was pretty close between the two guys, but Barnes defense and well rounded contributions on offense put him ahead.</p>

      <label for="lcqhwmi" class="commentText"><p>Because 32 games is a pretty small sample size. Every player in the league goes through hot and cold stretches. RJ&rsquo;s numbers barely changed throughout his 5 years with the Knicks. It is highly unlikely that he would all of sudden immediately take a huge leap upon being traded to the Raptors; most likely he just had a hot finish to end the season which is normal.</p>

      <label for="lcqyfmk" class="commentText"><p>Diminishing this to &ldquo;hot and cold stretches&rdquo; or &ldquo;sample size&rdquo; is such lazy analysis. It&rsquo;s fitting when a player is not changing his playstyle at all, but you can spend literally 5 minutes looking at the actual stats and you&rsquo;ll realize this is the result of substantive changes in his playstyle due to him being in a different, more appropriate system.</p>

<p><strong>Shot attempts in NYC:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>31% of shot attempts were catch and shoot</li>
<li>11.9% of shot attempts were pullups (notably on very bad efficiency - 24% FG),</li>
<li>56.7% of shots at the rim.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shot Attempts in TOR:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>24.2%</strong> of shot attempts were catch/shoot</li>
<li><strong>3.9%</strong> of shot attempts were pullups and his efficiency has now doubled to 47.4%</li>
<li><strong>72% of shot attempts</strong> are now at the rim.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly these upticks in FG% are completely tied to his reduction in catch/shoots and pullups and instead there is way more of a focus of him feasting at the rim. This was impossible in NY with the way the paint was clogged before Donte and OG got there (and even Hartenstein playing more). His %s may not be this high for a whole season but these adjustments show he&rsquo;s definitely going to have a way better season next year than he ever did in NY.</p>

      <label for="lcroz64" class="commentText"><p>While I agree with your thought process that he became more efficient due to shooting better shots, I’m still doubtful that he can sniff the 55% mark next year after being a 42% shooter throughout his career in NYK. He’s been a notoriously terrible finisher at the rim. I acknowledge that spacing is definitely better in Toronto but I feel that the 30 game sample size is not enough to show he’s become that much better at finishing.</p>

      <label for="lcqsuzi" class="commentText"><p>First off the sub pretty much gave up on him a couple years into his career.  Second he got traded to a team that was certainly tanking so no one watched.  You&rsquo;re also expecting this place to actually watch games which is a giant mistake.  He&rsquo;s on a new team though so we&rsquo;ll see what he can do with everyone healthy and a full summer to finally get acclimated.</p>

<p>The overall issue is consistency.  He&rsquo;ll have stretches where he can&rsquo;t hit the broad sign of a barn and gets dumped on.  Then he&rsquo;d somehow catch fire and you&rsquo;d think he finally turned a corner.  Then he&rsquo;ll get some untimely injury that takes him out for a little and it&rsquo;s back to square 1.</p>

RJ&rsquo;s fit with the offense Raptors is running is better for him. Julius and RJ just doesn&rsquo;t play well together. If RJ can improve his stats  and do it consistently for 1 whole season, then we will talk.</p>

<p>Also doesnt help that he plays for the Raptors now and they were bad last season.</p>

His efficiency on the Knicks was horrible (was shooting 42.3 percent on field goals on 14.9 attempts per game), and he never broke 50 percent field goal percentage on the Knicks. He historically cannot shoot the 3 ball well either, and he only shot 40 percent from 3 in his 2nd season, then proceeded to shoot 34 and 31 percent in the following 2 seasons with only 1 more attempt per game.</p>

His career has been the definition of inconsistent play so I don’t blame folks for wanting to see him keep that up for a longer stretch. That being said 32 games of pretty great play is impressive. His defense is also nowhere near as dreadful as some are making it out to be.</p>

<p>A decent player can score for a bad team. Somebody has to. But there’s a reason that you put a 20 ppg player from a good team on the All Star team instead of the guy getting 25 on a bad team.</p>

<p>RJ isn’t a star. Knicks fans know it. Knick management knew it, which is why they traded him.</p>

<p>He’s a talented guy that can probably be the 3rd best player on a contender. I was always rooting for him since Duke.</p>

<p>Ultimately, people give up much sooner on players now than we used to. It used to be said that a perimeter player wasn’t in their prime until they hit 27-28. Now, if they’re not an all star by 22, we give up.</p>

      <label for="lcrjgfx" class="commentText"><p>why do those 32 games matter more than the rest of his career when he was playing in more important games with better talent around him?</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s never come close to replicating that for a full season or in the playoffs:</p>

<p>2024 raptors: 1.23 points per shot attempt (psa), 81st percentile</p>

<p>2022-23 Knicks reg season: 1.06 psa, 25th percentile</p>

<p>2022-23 playoffs: 1.09 psa, 41st</p>

<p>21-22 reg season: 1.02 psa, 20th</p>

<p>20-21 reg season: 1.06 psa, 39th</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s fine and I hope he continues to improve but I think it&rsquo;s wild to think he has star potential. I also wouldn&rsquo;t really classify his game as overly athletic; feel like his development hinges on being a strong, fundamentally sound, right play/ right time kind of guy.</p>

<p>maybe I&rsquo;m just scarred by how bad he was in the 2023 playoffs.</p>

Maybe it&rsquo;s just a way better fit for him, or maybe it was a hot streak vs teams who didn&rsquo;t care very much about putting in effort vs the Raptors. If he&rsquo;s still doing it by the next all-star break, there will be a lot of hype.</p>

      <label for="lcs119m" class="commentText"><p>He wasn’t a great fit for us on the Knicks, but he’s incredibly streaky, he will either shoot 40% from 3 or he can’t hit a jumper to save his life, he’s the player you constantly hope will take a jump because of the flashes he can show but he never does, he isn’t the best defender &amp; he’s not that athletic, he lacks explosiveness &amp; struggles to create separation from his defender that results in a lot of contested lay ups at the rim.</p>

<p>I wish the best for him, I rooted for him hard on the Knicks, but I just think he is who he is at this point, even if he’s still young. I expect we will get some discourse surrounding him again come mid season, that feels all to familiar for Knicks fans.</p>

<p>He’s not someone you want to get carried away on because of 30 games.</p>

As much as hurts to admit half the reason we started to play so much better after we got OG was because he was gone. Happy for him he started playing better for Toronto though</p>

<p>I’m also convinced he had to have put money on the Bucks on the game on December 23rd. Watch the first 6 minutes of the third quarter and tell me that he wasn’t purposely sabotaging his team</p>

<p>His age is deceiving. He&rsquo;s entering into his SIXTH NBA season. We literally have years of data on the Knicks that show he simply isn&rsquo;t good enough to be all-star caliber. He&rsquo;s been in the league since 2019, it&rsquo;s gonna be the 2024-25 season soon.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s played 5 seasons with the Knicks. He has never played well or improved on a bad Knicks team (JB came to NY in 2022-23, Barrett literally had 3 years of being the 2nd option but did nothing with it). In the small sample size on the Raptors, his scoring increased slightly with increases in 3 point percentage and FG percentage, but his free throw percentage dropped to 63 percent. If you&rsquo;ve seen him play at all, you&rsquo;ll notice he&rsquo;s a negative on the defensive end. He simply cannot play defense, he&rsquo;s a literal traffic cone.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This argument would&rsquo;ve worked if he was 22, but he&rsquo;s literally 24 entering into his 6th nba season with nothing to show for it, but apparently he&rsquo;s got time to develop on the Raptors? He&rsquo;s literally into his 2nd year of a 4 year 107 mil rookie extension, but apparently he has time to develop? 26 mil is a lot of money to develop a guy heading into his 6th year in the league on a bad Raptors team.</p>

<p>Literally people have been saying every year &ldquo;he&rsquo;s still young, he has time to develop, this is the year that he&rsquo;ll improve.&rdquo; When does that stop? 6 years is a lot of time, basically sending your kid off to kindergarten or even the 1st grade. He&rsquo;s got playoff experience as well, yet he hasn&rsquo;t improved off of playing in a high-pressure scenario.</p>

<p>Sure, he was playing in NY, and the NY media and fans are notorious for their pressure on players, but now he&rsquo;s in the same exact scenario on the Raptors when the Knicks were bad in 2019, 2020, and 2021.</p>

<p>At what point do you not consider someone a young player? Literally your definition that six years in the league doesn&rsquo;t mean RJ is not a young player is like saying Obi Toppin is a young player at the age of 26 because he&rsquo;s only played in 4 season. Literally moving goalposts to make out a narrative.</p>
