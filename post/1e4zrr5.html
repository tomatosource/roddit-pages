So many teams over/approaching an apron too. Zero FAs have received the full nontaxpayer MLE for multiple years this summer.</p>

If teams hit the second apron they&rsquo;re fucked. What&rsquo;s happening is teams are spending a majority of the cap on their stars and they need to fill out the rest of their roster with value signings.</p>

      <label for="ldj27hn" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s because teams payrolls are still really high from the last CBA.  Once some of the contracts that never would have been handed out under this CBA start to expire, I think we&rsquo;re going to see MLE level guys start to get deals again.  It&rsquo;s just going to take a couple years to reset because only time can fix the existing overpays.</p>

<p>I think eventually, you will see &ldquo;Fringe max&rdquo; guys not getting it because it fucks up team building too much.</p>

<p>But we have to wait for it to equalize first. Right now, too many teams are newar the apron because the new CBA is like 2 years old.</p>

<p>Caleb Martin isn’t a fringe starter, he certainly didn’t start for the Heat unless there were injuries. He came off the bench and scored 10pts a game at under league average efficiency. He’s also going into his age 29 season.</p>

      <label for="ldikp89" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if I necessarily agree with that.</p>

<p>Lately, a lot of teams have been re-signing their players to max contracts with the idea that they&rsquo;ll just deal the guy down the line and don&rsquo;t want to let the asset walk for nothing. In the past, players would get signed to these crazy overpays and even though we&rsquo;d all deem the contract untradeable, it would inevitably get traded. The thing is that if a player commands a high salary, he&rsquo;s usually decent, and because the cap rules weren&rsquo;t too stringent teams would just pay the extra cost to get the guy in their building.</p>

<p>But now, teams are less willing to give those giant, risky contracts and are also less willing to trade for those players. So now you&rsquo;re seeing teams like the Clippers let PG walk for nothing, because they don&rsquo;t think they can get rid of a 55 mil 27 year old Paul George in a few years. Or you&rsquo;re seeing guys like Zach Lavine have 0 or negative trade value because teams are so afraid of the aprons.</p>

<p>I know the players union is upset with Brunson for his pay cut, but it&rsquo;s better for like 90% of their constituents. In the past the top players were feasting and pretty much everyone else had to take less relative to their worth. Remember, 51% of the revenue still goes to the players they&rsquo;re not losing any money. You might see more top tier players take pay cuts to allow their teammates to get compensated more fairly and to keep the team together.</p>

      <label for="ldjs391" class="commentText"><p>Has the player&rsquo;s union said they were upset? I couldn&rsquo;t find anything specific. In recent years Harden took less for Philly to get Tucker, and LeBron had his list of players he&rsquo;d take a pay cut for, and I don&rsquo;t believe they said anything in response to those. To your point about 51% going to the players either way, in theory Brunson taking his extension now should be a net neutral from the union&rsquo;s perspective, in that if he gets <span class="math inline">\(35M and Teammate X gets \)</span>15M, or he gets <span class="math inline">\(46M and Teammate Y gets \)</span>4M, that is still $50M of salary going to the players (assuming the Knicks are spending the same on the team in either scenario).</p>

      <label for="ldip1j3" class="commentText"><p>Superstars will still get max contracts.  There will be a handful of teams that need to spend cap space and a sub-star who wants to get paid (Tobias Harris) will try to sign with them ASAP.  There will be a few free agent signings that seem ludicrous in the abstract but make sense in using cap space to improve the team (Hartenstein).  Players who think they can hold out for more money may find out the music stops quicker than they think (Caleb Martin, Gary Trent Jr).  The main difference is that paying a guy who&rsquo;s not quite a star a max salary is going to be more crippling than before.  That&rsquo;s why the Jamal Murray extension is one to watch. Murray will probably never be a top 20 player, but he wants max money.  If he becomes a free agent, it&rsquo;s iffy that some team gives him a max unless he goes to Washington or Detroit etc.  However, the Nuggets can&rsquo;t replace him and are over the cap without him, so if he walks they are probably no longer title contenders.  If they give him the money that he wants, they are up against the second apron and their bench is washed minimums and second round picks.  So it&rsquo;s a tough decision for Denver, where before they would have just maxed him and kept the team together.</p>

      <label for="ldioknl" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a shit load of money. If that money given allows the team to get stronger and potentially increase his odds to be a NBA finals player, it&rsquo;s an interesting issue.  Would you give up 37M for a better set of team mates to win the chip?</p>

<p>They drew parallels to Melo always making sure he got his money, and he never went all that far in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="ldizntn" class="commentText"><p>my only issue with this point is that, obviously it’s a good thing to take a pay cut to build a better team and play with your friends, but under the old CBA the knicks could have just paid all their guys their fair value and their only consequences would have been that Dolan paid more taxes.</p>

<p>like, the cba is really just allowing billionaires to cheap out on their rosters under the guise of “we want to remain flexible” etc, and it’s not like that extra money is going anywhere besides the owners pockets.</p>

<p>I remember when this sub was saying NBA is going to throw the hammer down on the players for requesting trades often and missing games.</p>

<p>You all wanted a lockout and for players contract becoming none guaranteed.</p>

<p>Players gave up some minor stuff like the minimum game and hard cap rules in favour of getting the same percentage as before right before NBA is about to sign a much more lucrative tv deal.</p>

<p>It was a good deal for both sides.</p>

<p>By the way, I highly doubt CJ was the one negotiating. They have lawyers that do that for them. I doubt CJ unilaterally signed that deal.</p>

      <label for="ldios0s" class="commentText"><p>This year, a lot of teams are too close to the tax or first apron to use the full amount, due to the salary cap coming in lower than expected. A few of the teams who can comfortably afford it are rebuilding and may prefer to save it for a trade.</p>

<p>Perhaps this might change when more teams gravitate towards salary structures like the Celtics&rsquo; and Knicks&rsquo; which emphasize depth and balance, while the bloated contracts for &ldquo;Bird rights trap&rdquo; players like Lavine, Beal, BI, Poole, and Jerami Grant eventually expire. Losing a B tier player for nothing is better in the long run than paying him A tier money.</p>

      <label for="ldiupcm" class="commentText"><p>The issue is a combo of the CBA but also of teams lacking cap space&hellip;.look around the league&hellip;.it&rsquo;s a one/two punch&hellip;.teams are maxed out. Caleb Martin got <span class="math inline">\(40M so I don't know why he keeps being brought up as a casualty. He got paid. The only casualty so far is Trent Jr. and perhaps Valanciunas but JV's value was slightly limited due to his defensive issues and lack of spacing. He still got \)</span>30M and a starting job.</p>

<p>DJJ got paid good money, Caleb got paid good money, Melton got paid good money and so did Naji. Some of this is hypervenilation.</p>

      <label for="ldjmi1a" class="commentText"><p>The changes in the recent CBA, including the ability to use the MLE as a trade exception and teams being close to the apron, have led to a situation where free agents have not been receiving the full mid-level exception salary for multiple years during the summer. Teams are likely being more cautious with their spending and roster construction due to these new rules and restrictions.</p>

      <label for="ldjy8aq" class="commentText"><p>This feels bad for small market teams? If guys are taking pay cuts already, wouldn’t they rather just go to a big market or contending teams to raise their value instead of taking a mid contract with a small market team. Contending teams will also have bigger roles considering they’ll have max players taking up their cap space.</p>

      <label for="ldk7t4r" class="commentText"><p>Yeah which is weird because most of these rules are implemented to help smaller market teams but it ends up just screwing them over.</p>

<p>If anything, contending/big market teams benefit from this the most because they’ll be able round out their team with high quality guys for much lower pay while small markets will likely have to overpay for middle tier guys.</p>

<p>Like I love Hartenstein to OKC but for 29 a year? Sheesh..</p>
