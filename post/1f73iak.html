    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Steph is currently on 3747 made 3s, and is only 253 away.
Since 2012-2013 only two times he didn&rsquo;t make at least 250 in a season.
The first time in 2017-2018 where he made <sup>212</sup>&frasl;<sub>501</sub> in 51 games, and the second time in 2019-2020 where he played only 5 games.
Even in 2021-2022 where had a 38 3p% he still made 285 3s.
Barring any long injuries, he probably makes 300 3s next year again, making him the only player with more than 4000 3s.</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s hit 45.4% on 11.2 attempts/game in his unanimous MVP season. Its an insane combination of efficiency &amp; volume</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see analytics on Steph&rsquo;s shots broken down to how much hip rotation he completes throughout the shot, how many inches the defender&rsquo;s hand are to his face at the point of release, how many degrees he&rsquo;s facing away from the basket when starting the shot (like those instances where he fumbles and makes a hail Mary)</p>

<p>Combine those stats and make an index for shot difficulty percentage</p>

The gold medal game encapsulated your point perfectly - LeBron AND KD wide open are like “nah, Steph’s better despite being doubled right now” and <strong>pass the ball back to Steph to shoot a double teamed guarded fade-away clutch 3</strong>.  And did so repeatedly.</p>

<p>And nobody on earth questioned those decisions by them lol.</p>

<p>Like the GOAT tier player and shooter both were like nah fam, Steph is that much better than us when he’s on, don’t be silly.</p>

When Dennis Scott played with Shaq, he was the best 3 point shooter in the NBA. When Shaq went to LA, Scott became a journeyman role player looking for a team. Shaq gave him wide open looks. The game is played 5 on 5 and shot difficulty has everything to do with your stats. Just look at that interview with Austin Reeves. He said the hardest part of guarding Steph was that by the end of the game, you have no legs. So you can&rsquo;t hit your shots without your legs.

      <label for="ll61o3w" class="commentText"><p>It’s the classic shot difficulty conversation, like the value of guys like Steph and Dame creating off the bounce stepback 3s in isolation compared to guys who feast on a diet of uncontested catch and shoot corner threes.  You might have a higher percentage if you’re taking easier statistically more efficient looks, but the value add of those high difficulty self created 3s is how it helps unlock the rest of the offense because of how defenders have to react when they know they need to pick those off the bounce shooters up and cover them several feet beyond the line, which makes creating for themselves and everyone else on the floor a little easier as a result.</p>

So a player has to shoot as many times as harden in a season at above league avg rate to sniff steph record. It&rsquo;s hard for players right now to make 300 3s in a season. His record sounds easy to catch but realistically u have to have a 2019 harden season for about 8 yrs to make some ground towards it</p>

Sure 3pt volume has gone up across the league in the last decade, but noone individually is remotely close to averaging his per game 3PMs and the next highest active player is still 1000 off Steph&rsquo;s current total.</p>

<p>Even with the boom in 3P shooting, I still don&rsquo;t think Steph&rsquo;s record is going to get broken.  He led the league in 3PM in every season since 2012.  Most guys do not get the opportunity to take as many attempts as him, even if they are elite shooters.  You have to either have the same off ball skills or incredible self-creation if you&rsquo;re that good of a shooter.  Buddy got up less than 7 attempts per game last year because of this.  If it&rsquo;s the only thing you can do, teams are not going to give you any space at all.  Look at Korver, who was a very nice off ball player, still only got up 6 attempts a game at his peak.  And you know they wanted more that season because he was knocking them down at 49%.</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s record is likely to hold for a long time</p>

<p>Say Steph ends up with around 4500.  </p>

<p> If another Buddy comes along and makes 250 a year it would take 18 seasons to catch the record.  </p>

<p> If they can make 300 that goes down to 15 years.  300 a year is a shade over 3.5 a game if you play all 82 (I know)  </p>

<p> It doesn&rsquo;t feel unbreakable. But maybe the sheer consistency would prove insurmountable.</p>

      <label for="ll5a2ra" class="commentText"><p>You have to be taking ~9 threes a game to hit 3.5 a game though.  And my point is if you don&rsquo;t have a bunch of other redeeming qualities, people are just going to face guard you as a shooter.  Buddy is a great example of this as he hasn&rsquo;t been able to consistently get off that many threes through his career.  The longevity piece is obviously a massive component too and playing at that level for the entirety of ~15-18 season is very impressive.  Factor in some ramp up and ramp down and you&rsquo;re probably looking at 20 seasons in the league.</p>

<p>I still think 20 years is a pretty big reach. It’s astounding what Steph has been able to do for so long.</p>

<p>nobody shot threes with any regularity until at least the mid 90s when they moved the line in</p>

<p>and then nobody really used it outside of fandoms like Reggie, Ray, Dirk, and your Korver/Kapono types</p>

<p>the SSOL Suns, Steph, and the Heatles spacing paved the forefront to the point three pointers are damn near half the shots in the game these days</p>

<p>lastly, Steph Curry entered into the league at 21 and has missed hundreds of games due to injury</p>

<p>some kid is gonna come in the league at 19 and stay healthy til 38 and he’s gonna bomb away 8 times a game and will beat Steph’s record</p>

<p>If you have 250 3PM per season you would have to play 16 years to make 4000 3s. In the history of the nba just 13 players have made that many 3s in a season and only 6 have done it more than once. That list is</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Duncan Robinson x2</p></li>

<li><p>Damian Lillard x2</p></li>

<li><p>Klay Thompson x4</p></li>

<li><p>James Harden x4</p></li>

<li><p>Buddy Hield x5</p></li>

<li><p>Steph Curry x10</p></li>

<p>In order to beat the record that steph eventually ends up setting you either would have to be just as good a shooter as steph or be one of the best shooters of all time and play like <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> years.</p>

      <label for="ll4tbc4" class="commentText"><p>I dont think it will be unbreakable. In fact, I think it will be sooner than people think. You have to remember nearly <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of Steph&rsquo;s career was under the old mindset. Plus he&rsquo;s missed a lot of games due to injury. I cant find it now but I saw a comparison of how much even an average shooters like Trae young are way ahead in makes at the respective stages of their careers. So it&rsquo;ll probably only take longevity and avergae shooting to get there.</p>

      <label for="ll52s7h" class="commentText"><p>This is just plain wrong. Trae Young has 1059 career 3s over 6 seasons. If he kept that pace for 20 seasons he gets 3530.. a good 200 short of Curry&rsquo;s current total after 15 seasons. Just do the math instead of assuming every player is automatically gonna become as good as Steph Curry because of &ldquo;mentality shift&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="ll570qr" class="commentText"><p>yeah, I don&rsquo;t think people properly understand the lead Curry has on volume &amp; efficiency from 3. He&rsquo;s basically been shooting 3&rsquo;s at 125% of the next closest guy for a full decade. That&rsquo;s one of the biggest numerical leads any player has had in any category.</p>

<p>Trae isn&rsquo;t even the best candidate to challenge Curry, but for reference Trae has made 1059 3&rsquo;s since coming into the league in 2018. Since 2018, Curry has made 559 more 3&rsquo;s than Trae has, and he&rsquo;s done it playing 76 less games than Young. He&rsquo;s made 150% of Young&rsquo;s total 3&rsquo;s and has made nearly <em>double</em> the amount of 3&rsquo;s per game as Young in that span (4.9 vs. 2.6 per game)</p>

<p>I think the Curry record is going to wind up more like the Stockton assist record. It&rsquo;s not just that he&rsquo;s extends his lead every single game he plays, it&rsquo;s that (despite missing lots of games in his career) he&rsquo;s proving to also have pretty uncommon longevity as a high-volume shooter. That&rsquo;s a very rare combination.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think anyone currently in the league has a shot at catching him, so we are at least a full career away from anybody getting there. Steph is holding the career total record for AT LEAST 20 years and who knows what could happen in that time, maybe the meta shifts again, maybe in the future every can shoot 38%+ on 3s and there isn&rsquo;t a player with the opportunity to combine the volume, efficiency, and longevity to match Steph.</p>

      <label for="ll569yp" class="commentText"><p>The point was that Young has a head start in totals while shooting significantly worse % than Curry. It was to highlight how many fewer 3s Curry was shooting early in his career. Not that Trae Young was gonna break the record. All you have to do is imagine a player shooting mid to high 30s, which is average in the NBA, instead of low to mid 30s like Young, and you can see how the numbers would translate.</p>

      <label for="ll57lsr" class="commentText"><p>Do you understand that when most players increase their volume of 3s, the efficiency tends to go down. Like no player outside of Curry has shown that they can sustain a 40% clip at 8+ attempts a game, and you want me to imagine an imaginary player performs at that level for 20 plus seasons. Curry&rsquo;s numbers are simply broken, even with the time he has missed. Seriously just do the math of anyone that actually has a chance.</p>

      <label for="ll4ydxe" class="commentText"><p>I tried to dispute this but the closest active player I could find that has a chance is Trae Young, who at best, has &ldquo;only&rdquo; made 3.4 3s in a game in a season.</p>

<p>Adjusting this to Steph&rsquo;s current age of 35 gives him 9 more years + 82 games, that&rsquo;s 2509 more 3s to his current 1059 for a total of 3568 3s.</p>

<p>So even in this best case scenario, he&rsquo;s still 179 short of Curry&rsquo;s current record. Just wow.</p>

      <label for="ll54izw" class="commentText"><p>Yeh its actually staggering. He averages 3.9 3s a game for his career so far, which is so far ahead of the next closest person, and even tho he missed 2 years due to injury, he has still played 13 full seasons. That adds up to a current career mark that will probs only be surpassed by an efficient volume 3pt shooter who can play at a high level for 20 seasons. The closest person to that is buddy hield, and i dont he&rsquo;ll play 20 seasons at that high of a level. And it doesnt even take into account that Curry could possibly play at an elite level for possibly another 3 to 4 years. So i wouldnt be surprised if his career 3 pt total reaches 4500 +.</p>

      <label for="ll5dy44" class="commentText"><p>When I think of unbreakable records in sport it is generally because the meta or rules of the game have changed to reduce the accumulation of a particular stat. For example, Wilt playing more than 48 minutes per game in a season - no team is ever going to play a star that much again.</p>

<p>3s should remain at about their current level of prominence for a long time unless the NBA adds a 4pt line or something like that. I don&rsquo;t think that any of the current players are going to break it but at some point we&rsquo;ll see someone at a similar level of talent as Curry, on a similarly good team, and with fewer injury-riddled seasons. We could absolutely be waiting a long while for these stars to align, however!</p>

I think they&rsquo;re pretty much level through the first 6 years, Curry ahead by probably like 20-30 though he missed almost an entire season one of those years.</p>

<p>I think the big argument against Doncic getting close though is he doesn&rsquo;t need 4000 3s to pass him in all liklihood I think he&rsquo;ll need closer to 5000.</p>

If someone comes along and takes 10 a game (which Luka only just did this season) for their whole career and is healthy for the length of their career they have a shot even if they shoot league average. More so than anyone touching his shooting peak from 15-17. This era has just started. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable. Players only just started taking tons of 3s in a game.</p>

So thats at least 15+ years of it standing. 15 years of 250 3s a season is only 3750 threes. Curry probably ends up around 4500. Who is even shooting at the volume needed to touch it right now? Luka? He&rsquo;ll never have a high enough percentage to touch it</p>

      <label for="ll5f6zq" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s interesting because longevity will probably be a big factor there.  3p volume is up across the league and players like Duncan Robinson reached 1,000 made 3s faster than Steph but keeping that up for 4k or more might prove to be rare.  We know somebody like Duncan ain&rsquo;t gonna hit 4k ever.</p>

      <label for="ll579ou" class="commentText"><p>Last summer, I was just hanging with my friends at a small local cafe when we saw Steph Curry walked in, with his wife.</p>

<p>He walked in like any other average person would and just sat down in a quiet corner. The waitress was not a basketball fan and somehow doesn&rsquo;t recognize him, took his order and went away.</p>

<p>By then, we were really stoked to see Stephen Curry.  However, we decided not to interrupt his Sunday with his wife but it was obvious that we recognized him and kept casting admiring glances at him.  He was pretty cool about it and winked at us a few times.  I guess it could be the fact that one of us was wearing a basketball jersey; it was Matt, he was wearing an old school Grant Hill Detroit Pistons jersey.</p>

<p>We had already finished our meals but we didn&rsquo;t want to leave before Steph did.  We ordered a round of drinks (not alcoholic, it was a small local cafe) and some finger food then continued eating, happily just chatting while casting glances at Steph, just happy to be in the same district code as he was.</p>

<p>Soon after, Steph and his wife were done with their meal.  They got up, paid and left.</p>

<p>We talked a little more before deciding to head to a local bar.  As we called for the bill, the waitress told us it was already paid for.  We asked by who and she simply said &ldquo;that pale guy with skinny arms&rdquo;.</p>

He already has 1200 made in 6 seasons and he made 284 last season. Assuming he makes around 250 per year from now on, he would be at 3700 in 10 years.</p>

      <label for="ll54z1p" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s probably worth tracking where Luka&rsquo;s volume winds up, because he&rsquo;s only made over 250 3&rsquo;s in one solitary season (last year). Last year was an outlier in volume and efficiency so far. If any guy has the skill to keep it up, it&rsquo;s him, but it&rsquo;s probably early to assume he&rsquo;ll do a thing he done once for the next decade.</p>

      <label for="ll5ch4a" class="commentText"><p>Ever is a long time, but to hit 4000 threes over a 15 year career is 267 per year. There have only been 27 seasons in NBA history where that happened and 9 of them belong to Steph. Of course, almost all of those 27 seasons have happened recently, but the rest of the list is a rotating cast of players who are legendary shooters themselves but don’t even come close to averaging such an insane stat. Even for guys like Lillard, Harden, Hield, etc. 270+ is the outlier rather than the rule.</p>

      <label for="ll5w30l" class="commentText"><p>The way “made threes” has became a thing is so odd to me. It’s literally just another form of scoring. Nobody sits around and discusses how many career made layups someone has lol. I get the value of them being worth more, and why things like TS% and eFG% is better than just raw FG% because of that. But this new obsession with just looking at a number of threes made still feels so pointless to me.</p>
