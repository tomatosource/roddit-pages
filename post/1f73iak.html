    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Steph is currently on 3747 made 3s, and is only 253 away.
Since 2012-2013 only two times he didn&rsquo;t make at least 250 in a season.
The first time in 2017-2018 where he made <sup>212</sup>&frasl;<sub>501</sub> in 51 games, and the second time in 2019-2020 where he played only 5 games.
Even in 2021-2022 where had a 38 3p% he still made 285 3s.
Barring any long injuries, he probably makes 300 3s next year again, making him the only player with more than 4000 3s.</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s hit 45.4% on 11.2 attempts/game in his unanimous MVP season. Its an insane combination of efficiency &amp; volume</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see analytics on Steph&rsquo;s shots broken down to how much hip rotation he completes throughout the shot, how many inches the defender&rsquo;s hand are to his face at the point of release, how many degrees he&rsquo;s facing away from the basket when starting the shot (like those instances where he fumbles and makes a hail Mary)</p>

<p>Combine those stats and make an index for shot difficulty percentage</p>

Sure 3pt volume has gone up across the league in the last decade, but noone individually is remotely close to averaging his per game 3PMs and the next highest active player is still 1000 off Steph&rsquo;s current total.</p>

<p>Even with the boom in 3P shooting, I still don&rsquo;t think Steph&rsquo;s record is going to get broken.  He led the league in 3PM in every season since 2012.  Most guys do not get the opportunity to take as many attempts as him, even if they are elite shooters.  You have to either have the same off ball skills or incredible self-creation if you&rsquo;re that good of a shooter.  Buddy got up less than 7 attempts per game last year because of this.  If it&rsquo;s the only thing you can do, teams are not going to give you any space at all.  Look at Korver, who was a very nice off ball player, still only got up 6 attempts a game at his peak.  And you know they wanted more that season because he was knocking them down at 49%.</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s record is likely to hold for a long time</p>

You have to remember nearly <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of Steph&rsquo;s career was under the old mindset. Plus he&rsquo;s missed a lot of games due to injury. I cant find it now but I saw a comparison of how much even an average shooters like Trae young are way ahead in makes at the respective stages of their careers. So it&rsquo;ll probably only take longevity and avergae shooting to get there.</p>

If he kept that pace for 20 seasons he gets 3530.. a good 200 short of Curry&rsquo;s current total after 15 seasons. Just do the math instead of assuming every player is automatically gonna become as good as Steph Curry because of &ldquo;mentality shift&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="ll569yp" class="commentText"><p>The point was that Young has a head start in totals while shooting significantly worse % than Curry. It was to highlight how many fewer 3s Curry was shooting early in his career. Not that Trae Young was gonna break the record. All you have to do is imagine a player shooting mid to high 30s, which is average in the NBA, instead of low to mid 30s like Young, and you can see how the numbers would translate.</p>

I think they&rsquo;re pretty much level through the first 6 years, Curry ahead by probably like 20-30 though he missed almost an entire season one of those years.</p>

<p>I think the big argument against Doncic getting close though is he doesn&rsquo;t need 4000 3s to pass him in all liklihood I think he&rsquo;ll need closer to 5000.</p>

<p>Puts him level with Hakeem and Durant and he&rsquo;s already ahead of players like Curry, Dirk and David Robinson.</p>

      <label for="ll4ydxe" class="commentText"><p>I tried to dispute this but the closest active player I could find that has a chance is Trae Young, who at best, has &ldquo;only&rdquo; made 3.4 3s in a game in a season.</p>

<p>Adjusting this to Steph&rsquo;s current age of 35 gives him 9 more years + 82 games, that&rsquo;s 2509 more 3s to his current 1059 for a total of 3568 3s.</p>

<p>So even in this best case scenario, he&rsquo;s still 179 short of Curry&rsquo;s current record. Just wow.</p>

      <label for="ll54izw" class="commentText"><p>Yeh its actually staggering. He averages 3.9 3s a game for his career so far, which is so far ahead of the next closest person, and even tho he missed 2 years due to injury, he has still played 13 full seasons. That adds up to a current career mark that will probs only be surpassed by an efficient volume 3pt shooter who can play at a high level for 20 seasons. The closest person to that is buddy hield, and i dont he&rsquo;ll play 20 seasons at that high of a level. And it doesnt even take into account that Curry could possibly play at an elite level for possibly another 3 to 4 years. So i wouldnt be surprised if his career 3 pt total reaches 4500 +.</p>

He already has 1200 made in 6 seasons and he made 284 last season. Assuming he makes around 250 per year from now on, he would be at 3700 in 10 years.</p>

      <label for="ll4smfh" class="commentText"><p>Well Steph has 3 years on his contract, and I think he&rsquo;ll probably be good enough to go another year or two after that if he chooses and stays fit.  Luka it&rsquo;s harder to project.  I doubt he&rsquo;ll make 40, but if he does he&rsquo;ll likely break a few records and this might be one.</p>

      <label for="ll54z1p" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s probably worth tracking where Luka&rsquo;s volume winds up, because he&rsquo;s only made over 250 3&rsquo;s in one solitary season (last year). Last year was an outlier in volume and efficiency so far. If any guy has the skill to keep it up, it&rsquo;s him, but it&rsquo;s probably early to assume he&rsquo;ll do a thing he done once for the next decade.</p>
