</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>“Smh it was a crazy year playing in China! Shanghai Sharks by far worst organization l&rsquo;ve ever been a part of…Very unprofessional. They still owe me my playoff bonus from <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> season. They also still owe me the remaining balance of my salary for the <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> season.</p>

<p>“I was dealing with an injury during the season and it was taking longer than expected for me return. The Sharks tried to rush me back many times and told team doctors and doctors outside of the team to lie to me and tell me l&rsquo;m ok to play. I sent my MRI results to doctors in the states and they had different opinions and confirmed I wasn&rsquo;t ready to return to play. Because the injury was taking too long the Sharks were trying to find ways to terminate my contract on a fully guaranteed deal. They wrongfully terminated the contract on February 26th, 2024.</p>

<p>“They started off sending out warnings to my Chinese agents saying I wasnt showing up to practice. Chinese agents never responded to any of the warnings when I told them to. After the third warning the Sharks sent the agents a termination notice. The Sharks called board members from the CBA office to come in and investigate to see if their claims to terminate were valid. The league saw based off of security footage they were wrong and should of never terminated the contract. I was present at practice everyday.”</p>

<p>“After my contract was wrongfully terminated, CBA All Star weekend was a couple days away. I decided it was a good idea to go. The general manager of the Sharks was informed I was gonna be attending and was nervous and scared of what could happen. He called for a meeting at the All Star Hotel to try and get me back to the team, but the terms he presented were not in my best interest. He wanted to fly back to Shanghai together and go back with this Kumbaya story like everything was all good but I wasn&rsquo;t with it.”</p>

<p>“In March the third and final stage of the season begins. I&rsquo;m asking for meetings with the team to figure out how to get my remaining salary since I&rsquo;m on a fully guaranteed deal and they no longer want me on team. I want all my money since I&rsquo;m on a fully guaranteed contract, but know based off my previous experience they&rsquo;re gonna be on some BS and not give everything so I decide l&rsquo;ll take a bit less. They declined the requests for meetings and always have excuses for why. I told them many times I want to handle it peacefully and we can go our separate ways but they didn&rsquo;t want to. I goto a couple games and the fans and everyone is wondering what is going on because they don&rsquo;t want to release a statement on the situation after the league told them they have no right to do what they are trying to do such as terminating the contract and issuing unnecessary fines. “</p>

<p>“I get back to the hotel after attending one of the games. Now the General manager wants to have my room canceled. The general manager tells the hotel to send people to my room to force me out of there. There&rsquo;s six people coming to my room trying to break in and grab me out the room.
“They using weapons to try and break in and threatening me saying all kind of things.</p>

<p>“This what they was using to enter while was sleep. Put this thru the peep hole&hellip; snatched it when I heard the noise at the door”</p>

      <label for="lasi7ai" class="commentText"><p>Wait until you find out the clown show involving former rocket legend Zhou Qi. The team Xinjiang quit the league as a protest because of some shady decision made by the Chinese basketball association (whose chairman was Yao Ming btw) regarding Zhou Qi’s signing right. Zhou Qi basically refused to sign with Xinjiang and actually went to play in Australia for one year.</p>

<p>The whole thing is a crazy story. Look into it. The league is run by amateurs. There were stories like a foreign player got suspended in the playoff, and team would purposely lose game to wait for the suspension to be over so the player can be ready for next round (because the league is dominated by foreign players). Crazy stuff, look into it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just that the league is bad, the entire Chinese basketball circuit is a clownshow.  People think the AUU is bad but the Chinese youth sport academies basically have all the negative qualities of the AUU dialed up to a hundred with a side of extreme amounts of nepotism, bribing and bullying.  It&rsquo;s the same with soccer.  It&rsquo;s really sad since a country of 1.3 billion people with a significant basketball fanbase should be shitting out talent but the development programs in China have been so bad that only Yao Ming (who&rsquo;s a one out of a million genetic freak) became anything in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lasmefp" class="commentText"><p>I feel like a rich, tall, mildly famous basketball player could have a great life playing in the Euroleague in some Mediterranean beach city. You can just chill on the beach and run through hot European models if that’s your thing. Unless they’re paying a lot more, I don’t know why one would choose to live in China if given the choice. </p>
