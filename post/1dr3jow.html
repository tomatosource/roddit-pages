</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>“Smh it was a crazy year playing in China! Shanghai Sharks by far worst organization l&rsquo;ve ever been a part of…Very unprofessional. They still owe me my playoff bonus from <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> season. They also still owe me the remaining balance of my salary for the <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> season.</p>

<p>“I was dealing with an injury during the season and it was taking longer than expected for me return. The Sharks tried to rush me back many times and told team doctors and doctors outside of the team to lie to me and tell me l&rsquo;m ok to play. I sent my MRI results to doctors in the states and they had different opinions and confirmed I wasn&rsquo;t ready to return to play. Because the injury was taking too long the Sharks were trying to find ways to terminate my contract on a fully guaranteed deal. They wrongfully terminated the contract on February 26th, 2024.</p>

<p>“They started off sending out warnings to my Chinese agents saying I wasnt showing up to practice. Chinese agents never responded to any of the warnings when I told them to. After the third warning the Sharks sent the agents a termination notice. The Sharks called board members from the CBA office to come in and investigate to see if their claims to terminate were valid. The league saw based off of security footage they were wrong and should of never terminated the contract. I was present at practice everyday.”</p>

<p>“After my contract was wrongfully terminated, CBA All Star weekend was a couple days away. I decided it was a good idea to go. The general manager of the Sharks was informed I was gonna be attending and was nervous and scared of what could happen. He called for a meeting at the All Star Hotel to try and get me back to the team, but the terms he presented were not in my best interest. He wanted to fly back to Shanghai together and go back with this Kumbaya story like everything was all good but I wasn&rsquo;t with it.”</p>

<p>“In March the third and final stage of the season begins. I&rsquo;m asking for meetings with the team to figure out how to get my remaining salary since I&rsquo;m on a fully guaranteed deal and they no longer want me on team. I want all my money since I&rsquo;m on a fully guaranteed contract, but know based off my previous experience they&rsquo;re gonna be on some BS and not give everything so I decide l&rsquo;ll take a bit less. They declined the requests for meetings and always have excuses for why. I told them many times I want to handle it peacefully and we can go our separate ways but they didn&rsquo;t want to. I goto a couple games and the fans and everyone is wondering what is going on because they don&rsquo;t want to release a statement on the situation after the league told them they have no right to do what they are trying to do such as terminating the contract and issuing unnecessary fines. “</p>

<p>“I get back to the hotel after attending one of the games. Now the General manager wants to have my room canceled. The general manager tells the hotel to send people to my room to force me out of there. There&rsquo;s six people coming to my room trying to break in and grab me out the room.
“They using weapons to try and break in and threatening me saying all kind of things.</p>

<p>“This what they was using to enter while was sleep. Put this thru the peep hole&hellip; snatched it when I heard the noise at the door”</p>

      <label for="lauufpj" class="commentText"><p>Probably going to another Asian league like Taiwan or the B-League in Japan. Going to China is for players to get bigger contracts then they would also anywhere else while getting to be the clear guy for a team. European leagues obviously vary in talent outside to EuroLeague and the money isn’t great unless you can get into one of the top 12 licensed teams.</p>

<p>Will have better luck picking up a big contract in East Asia.</p>

<p>This is why I laugh when I read about Redditors who think it&rsquo;s all sunshine and roses to emigrate from the US to play abroad. Redditors think it&rsquo;s like a paid vacation.</p>

<p>In reality, there are a huge number of social and cultural issues with emigrating, and the conditions are often nowhere near the level of the US. Europe will be a lot better, but there are still a lot of challenges that you don&rsquo;t understand until you do it.</p>

No injuries but weird ass communication and then just randomly being cut off and not being paid money you are owed. He said he had at least 3 contracts where he want paid what he was supposed to be. And that there&rsquo;s a lot of under the table things that go on too</p>

      <label for="latzcvh" class="commentText"><p>I mean you get the friends POV, same here with Vonleh. Other times theyll have clauses in contracts that mean the team is right, communication issues with agents and the team. This is believable and would happen anywhere really tho, NBA is just too rich and got too many eyes on it to fully be like that, but teams will still find ways to cut corners especially on fringe guys. From my small local European teams&rsquo; history with foreign players, theres multiple where they setup contracts to come and play but then dont even show up, since theyve basically signed a multiple deals with multiple different teams in different countries just looking to collect signing bonuses and any possible freebies. Its not just teams, but also lot of players and agents that scheme like that all the time everywhere. Its just greed, all the same everywhere.</p>

<p>Most redditors couldn’t tell you the difference between any European leagues though. There is tiers of teams that range in structure, payroll, and popularity. Massive difference playing for a Barcelona, Real Madrid, Monaco, or Olympiakos, vs a mid tier Lithuania or German team.</p>

<p>That guys who can break into the top 12 Euro teams typically has a far different experience than then most overseas players.</p>

<p>China is a different beast due to the extreme cultural differences and business practices. A lot of western players have been going to the B-League in Japan for awhile which has exploded in popularity. Australia’s NBL has also grown a ton in international recognition and reputation.</p>

The team Xinjiang quit the league as a protest because of some shady decision made by the Chinese basketball association (whose chairman was Yao Ming btw) regarding Zhou Qi’s signing right. Zhou Qi basically refused to sign with Xinjiang and actually went to play in Australia for one year.</p>

<p>The whole thing is a crazy story. Look into it. The league is run by amateurs. There were stories like a foreign player got suspended in the playoff, and team would purposely lose game to wait for the suspension to be over so the player can be ready for next round (because the league is dominated by foreign players). Crazy stuff, look into it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just that the league is bad, the entire Chinese basketball circuit is a clownshow.  People think the AUU is bad but the Chinese youth sport academies basically have all the negative qualities of the AUU dialed up to a hundred with a side of extreme amounts of nepotism, bribing and bullying.  It&rsquo;s the same with soccer.  It&rsquo;s really sad since a country of 1.3 billion people with a significant basketball fanbase should be shitting out talent but the development programs in China have been so bad that only Yao Ming (who&rsquo;s a one out of a million genetic freak) became anything in the NBA.</p>

<p>The biggest issue isn&rsquo;t nepotism, bribing and bullying. The main issues are parents pulling their kids out of becoming professional sports players (basically very few people practice during highschool due to prepping for gaokao).<br>
And that compounded with the next issue of lack of ambition. A lot of CBA players don&rsquo;t train really hard because the chances of leaving China and playing in the NBA is slim. Also despite the fact that they make less in China (around 1 - 2 million USD), they get more sponsorships with a cheaper cost of living. This makes them go with the belief in that, they don&rsquo;t have to be the best basketball player in the world, they just have to be good enough where they don&rsquo;t get replaced.</p>

      <label for="lat766e" class="commentText"><p>Nah nepotism, bribing and bullying is a root cause of those things you mentioned. The chances of leaving China and playing in the NBA is slim because of the clownshow development system that doesn&rsquo;t reward merit which explains the lack of ambition.</p>

<p>And China does well in a lot of other sports despite &ldquo;parents pulling their kids out of becoming professional sports players&rdquo;. The basketball/soccer programs being complete jokes despite being the most popular sports, is mostly on the programs being crap, and not on the parental culture.</p>

<p>Even if the parental culture is bad for sports, the size of the population would overcome that easily. Just as a numbers game. For example, Iceland had a great run making the fifa world cup in a much harder fifa region than China. Yet china hasn&rsquo;t made it there in forever. Iceland is a country of 400k people, meaning even if the parents in china are 3,000 times less likely to support their kids in sports, they should still have a talent pool advantage. But population can&rsquo;t overcome lack of organized and merit based programs. Which is why Iceland is better than China there.</p>

On the court, the Liaoning Flying Leopards have won the championship for the last three years, sweeping the finals 4-0 every year. The only reason I know this is that the former whipping boy on Tulane’s team is a forward named Zhang Zhenlin or Kevin Zhang as he was called in the US who has somehow carved out a decent career over there. Always rooted for him because Ron Hunter seemed to hate his guts for no reason lol</p>

      <label for="lat80f8" class="commentText"><p>The problem is being a mildly famous basketball player doesn&rsquo;t mean you can make it in Euroleague. A lot of notable NBA players failed to sustain a career there. It&rsquo;s not a retire into the sunset type of league. Obviously euroleague is the first choice if you&rsquo;re out of the NBA. The foreigners playing in China, most wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make a career in Euroleague.</p>

      <label for="lataydn" class="commentText"><p>Just because both are &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t mean the competition level is close to similar. Euroleague isn&rsquo;t CBA, there is a bigger gap between CBA and Euroleague than the Euroleague and the NBA. If you&rsquo;re living like that while playing for an Euroleague team you&rsquo;re gonna be out of contract after a few rounds, not only because it&rsquo;s a lot more competitive league, but also because Euroleague coaches don&rsquo;t tolerate unprofessional behavior, especially from high-paid players that are supposed to carry the team. You could maybe do that for a team that doesn&rsquo;t compete in a continental competition, but the salary then would be close to minimum wage in the US. CBA pays a lot, and players there are putting superstar numbers without a lot of effort because the local talent is awful, and while Vonleh situation is terrible, a lot of guys prefer it that way instead of competing and fighting for their spot in a stronger European league.</p>

Played against him at Assembly Hall back in 2013 when he was a freshman at Indiana and being touted as a potential lottery pick in the draft. It&rsquo;s sad to read this about his experience with the Sharks, but honestly not surprising at all. I played professionally in Europe and can confirm there are some wild operating stories from the international franchises because I have friends that have played all over Europe, China, Japan, and Russia. As a personal anecdote, our team did a 2.5 week preseason in China one year in the middle of the country and that experience confirmed that I don&rsquo;t have any desire to deal with China ever again in life if possible. I know Chinese basketball is the place to be for the most money, but quality of life just sounds so much worse. I would choose ACB (Spain) or BBL (Germany) <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times if I were in the position of a guy like Noah or other former-NBA players.</p>
