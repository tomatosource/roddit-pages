      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dv72ne/if_its_the_basketball_hall_of_fame_and_not_the/"><p>If it’s the Basketball Hall of Fame and not the NBA Hall of Fame, why isn’t Christian Laettner in it?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Literally the GOAT college player of the modern era. Four year starter that went to the Final Four for four straight years, playing in 23 of a possible 24 tournament games (winning 21 of them). National Player of the Year. One of the most iconic buzzer beaters in the history of basketball. You absolutely can’t “tell the story of basketball” without him.</p>

<p>For kicks, he also won a Gold Medal (technically is in the Hall for being on the Dream Team but that obviously doesn’t count the same way), and was a legitimate NBA contributor for over a decade including an All-Star appearance.</p>

<p>I’m told that Al Horford is a Hall of Famer in part because of his 2x NCAA titles, yet the most decorated NCAA player not named Kareem or Walton isn’t in it? Explain.</p>

One of the parts that always gets me is Vlade talking about the incident where he took away the Croatian flag from a fan who ran on the court after a game they’d won. It just seems like an impossible situation.</p>

<p>When John Wooden won NCAA player of the year as a Senior, did he go pro? No, he jumped right into coaching at the college level. The NBA was not the well established league it is today.</p>

      <label for="lbminqs" class="commentText"><p>Yes they do, but it has only been the <em>swing vote</em> for 2 players in the history of basketball: Ralph Sampson and Calvin Murphy. Otherwise it counts very, very little.</p>

<p>The OP used Laettner as an example, but I think the best example is <strong>Joakim Noah.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Had an even better college career than Al Horford. They were teammates on the same 2xNational Champions, but Noah was the leader and won a MOP (Horford didn’t). </p></li>

<li><p>Had a good NBA career. Includes multiple All-Star games, a First Team All NBA, 3xAll-Defense, and a DPOY. </p></li>

<li><p>Has international achievements, such as winning a Eurobasket Silver. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>That’s a resume way better than Christian Laettner. His college career was elite, one of the better ones ever (not many 2xNational Champions and MOP winners). But since college means almost nothing, he’s never getting in despite having a good pro and international career too. </p>

<p>Another good example is Rip Hamilton for someone with an elite college career and respectable pro career (better than Laettner’s pro career) who is never getting in. </p>

<p>EDIT: With all that said, I can see Horford being the 3rd ever player whose college career is a swing vote because his pro career (including longevity) and international career are good enough to get in with that alone. </p>

<p>EDIT2: Also forgot about Danny Manning. All-time college career (National champion, MOP, National POY, 3xAll American, 3xBig Eight POY, USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year), with 2xAll Stars and 14 years in the NBA but no shot at the HOF.  </p>

But I always thought Lee Humphrey should have gotten those awards in both Final Fours bc he was lights out from deep for two straight seasons lol. Noah and Horford and Brewer were just dominant and they couldnt be zoned up bc of Humphrey. That team was impossible to guard.</p>

      <label for="lbmql7r" class="commentText"><p>Yes Noah’s peak was super high because he made First Team All-NBA. But he had too many injuries and his team only had a few good years. </p>

<p>Also your point about Florida also shows that team accolades is about teammates too. So Horford wasn’t as individually dominant the way some might think. Definitely a huge part of 2 national championships but it helps to have great teammates. It’s a lot different than say Kemba’s national championship. </p>

<p>I don’t think Noah, Rip Hamilton, or Danny Manning will ever get into the Naismith Basketball HOF (all will or already have been inducted into the college basketball HOF though). </p>

<p>There’s actually a ton of examples of elite college basketball players (not as good as Laettner but still very elite) with better pro careers than Laettner who won’t get in. </p>

<p>I forgot about Danny Manning in the above post but he was one of the greatest college basketball players of all time with a historic senior year, went on to become a 2xAll Star, and people don’t even consider him a semifinalist for the HOF. </p>

<p>the &ldquo;average&rdquo; NBA player is never lasting a decade nor achieving an all star appearance, the &ldquo;average&rdquo; guy has a cup of coffee on a few summer league rosters and 14-16th man spots before he washes out the league and goes to Europe</p>

It can&rsquo;t be your only claim to fame. The Horford thing is a sweetener to a solid professional career, not the reason he would go in.</p>

<p>Laetner has a 0.2% HOF probability based on his pro career, Horford has a 23.8% HOF probability based on his pro career. The argument for Horford is that 2 NCAA championships make him worthy of being in the one quarter that would receive the nod with similar pro careers.</p>

But if you add his college ships to his nba resume, he’ll likely get in. Joakim Noah won defensive player of the year, was a 2 time all star, and almost certainly won’t make it. If Noah doesn’t make it based on NBA/college resume, do you really think Laettner should?</p>

<p>ETA: saw from the other comments that I’m not the first to make the Noah comp. Good job on the sanity check y’all!</p>

<p>The college football hall is also kind of a joke. Tim Tebow wasn’t a first ballot HOFer. Mike Leach, Pete Carroll, and Howard Schnellenberger are all permanently ineligible for it because of arbitrary cutoffs for win percentage and seasons coached (in Leach’s case it’s literally by one game and if you exclude the COVID season or include the bowl game his team played after he died he makes it).</p>

I’m ignorant, but are there many euroleague players getting in the hall without NBA achievements? NBA is the highest level league, so how can players without a good NBA resume make it to the hall of fame? I’m sure there’s some euroleague lifer legends than have made it in without NBA, but it’s the “hall of fame” not the “hall of very good”</p>

There’s also a huge issue in US sports where many fans do not have local teams, so support a college instead. And thus value them higher than they should.</p>

<p>I think the fact that Luka, Jokic and giannis are players who never played in college yet are valued almost unanimously in the top 5 best players in the world shows that college isn’t everything.</p>

<p>Top level talent used to stay in college until their Junior year. Then, when you add in ball’s explosion in popularity after ‘92, Balkan and Baltic development principles spreading around the globe, and the fact that euro-pro leagues have grown men filling out their rosters (many who played in college in the US). Those leagues should be better than power 5 or whatever ncaa teams.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>One would think that NIL would somewhat reverse this trend, but the fact that the NBA has kept its age requirement at 19 plus the fact that the NBA pays very well means that even a two-way contract is a much better option financially for most prospects since not everyone is guaranteed to make millions off of sponsorship deals.</p>

      <label for="lbm5pm5" class="commentText"><p>Not sure if you’re younger or not- so don’t take this as an attack.  But, when Laettner was playing college basketball, college basketball was an absolute monster.  Most guys stayed at least three years.  That Duke run was iconic in a way that is difficult to understand these days with college basketball’s relative irrelevance.  </p>

<p>This is all to say that college basketball achievements from that time frame should be weighed much more heavily than more modern college basketball achievements.  Like, exponentially more. </p>

      <label for="lbmlyxe" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the BASKETBALL HOF, not Pro, not NBA, just Basketball. So counting a college career as much as a pro career is absolutely fine, if it&rsquo;s a standout career. I hate Laettner, and I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m making this case, but I feel like, based on his college career and the Dream Team and his NBA career, he&rsquo;s worth a nod for the BHOF.</p>

      <label for="lbli593" class="commentText"><p>Because Laettner’s college career alone wasn’t enough to get him in. If he had the Al Horford NBA career he would have been a lock. It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>Look at it like getting an extra All-Star for each great college season and it makes sense. Laettner gets 2x extra. 3x if you want to be super generous. Add that to his 1x in the NBA and it’s a total of 3-4. Not enough.</p>

<p>Horford gets 2x extra. In addition to his 5x in the NBA. 7x total gets you in.</p>

<p>Same as JJ Redick. And Bobby Hurley. And Grant Hill. And Kyle Singler. And Chris Duhon. Actually pretty much every Duke player.</p>

<p>The only Duke players I can think of who were hated less while in college are Kyrie and Jahlil Okafor. Grayson Allen is about the same. Oh, and Dahntay Jones for Lakers fans.</p>

<p>You absolutely can’t “tell the story of basketball” without him.</p>

<p>This is about as good an argument as &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of only two players mentioned by name on &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Up Doc (Can We Rock)?,&rdquo; Shaq&rsquo;s 1993 collaboration with Fu-Schnickens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Depending on how long you make the story, you &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; tell the story of basketball without bringing up Kermit Washington, Lenny Bias, or Robert Horry.  But none of those players belong in the HOF.</p>

<p>And could write several volumes on the sport without mentioning Dan Issel or Alex English, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not HOFers.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;story of basketball&rdquo; is an entirely arbitrary concept.</p>

<p>I will agree that he might not be the college GOAT, but at least in the discussion. Even more so, at least Top 25.</p>

<p>I think he&rsquo;s around 5, but easily top 10 best/most accomplished/iconic college basketball player of all time. Being just in the top 50  All Time makes you great&hellip;and he was a lot more than that.</p>

<p>His personal offensive stats don&rsquo;t tell the whole story. He was also great defensively and made his whole team a lot better. But if you want to bring up stats&hellip;my favorite is that during the iconic Kentucky Final Four game, he was 20-20 shooting.</p>

<p>He made one of the biggest and most famous shots in basketball history&hellip;and was 20 for 20 that same game&hellip;right before winning ANOTHER title.</p>

<p>Yeah, he was better than &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lbm9vwi" class="commentText"><p>The reason a great college career is not enough is that it is not long enough. You cannot make the HoF is you were only a really good player for 4 years, regardless of level.  I think a good example of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> great years not being enough regardless of level is Penny Hardaway, who was really good to great for his first 4 years prior to injury, including 2 1st teams, but is not in the Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>Also, Lateneer was just a role player in his freshman year (8.9 ppg and 4.7 rpg), so he only really had 3 great years. He also only won the ACC player of the year 1 time. Just off the top of my head, I think anyone looking at the individual performance would say Tim Duncan was a better college basketball player. Of course Wake Forrest did not have the same quality of teammates around Duncan that Laettner had, so they were not nearly as successful. Duncan did not play with any lottery picks, and just 2 drafted players total. Laettner played with 7 drafted players, including the 2, 3, 7, and 12 overall picks.</p>

Hockey, football, and basketball have all considered accomplishments outside the NHL/NFL/NBA, but they treat them proportionately, because not every competition is the same. Christian Laettner is like the Doug Flutie case: CFL MVPs can only get him so far when he was largely a mediocre NFL player. If say, Mark Price or Shawn Marion had those college accomplishments, it could get them over the line. It&rsquo;s not enough to carry Laettner.</p>

      <label for="lbmaeqf" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Telling the story of X sport&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t what the Hall of Fame is for, nor has it ever been. That narrative started about 5 years ago to argue for the legitimacy of Eli Manning&rsquo;s case to get into Canton. It&rsquo;s an idiotic criteria that has never and should never be considered in any sport. That&rsquo;s not the point. A HOF is made to celebrate excellence, not interesting storylines. You also can&rsquo;t tell the story of basketball without mentioning JR Smith&rsquo;s infamous rebound in the 2018 Finals. That doesn&rsquo;t mean he belongs anywhere near the HOF.</p>

<p>For Laettner himself? Not enough of a career afterwards. Having a great 4 years against much less impressive competition and then being much worse in a better league isn&rsquo;t worthy of the HOF. He was on the Dream Team but he could have very easily not been, it&rsquo;s not like he was dropping 20 ppg. He had, by a huge margin, the fewest minutes on the 1992 Olympic team with the exception of John Stockton&hellip; who broke his leg two weeks before the games started. Most people only remember Laettner being on the Dream Team because they lament that it was a mistake to pick him instead of Shaq.</p>

<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, Horford has had a better career (also extremely impressive college run with two championships as a central part of an all-time NCAA team, NBA championship, 5 All-Star appearances, an All-NBA and All-Defensive appearance, playing for longer and still putting up meaningful minutes) and has a 23% estimate for making it into Springfield per Basketball Reference. So he very probably isn&rsquo;t making it into the HOF and he&rsquo;d already have a much better case than Laettner if he retired tomorrow.</p>

He&rsquo;d have won rookie of the year in almost any other year, he lost to SHAQ.   If you were to redraft the 1992 draft it still goes Shaq, Mourning, Laettner.   Anyway, his college career, his nba career, and his olympic career should be just enough to get him in.</p>

      <label for="lbn8hf6" class="commentText"><p>He’s in the Hall of Fame as part of the Dream Team, not that he deserved to even be on the team. With Ewing’s injury, it should have been Shaq. Heck, without Ewing’s injury, it should have been Shaq.</p>

<p>First of all, he’s a Curt Schilling case and while he is only a jerk and not a bigot, or so I think, he doesn’t have nearly the stats of Schilling. The Hall’s standard for non-NBA stars appears to be this: if you could prove yourself against NBA competition or played before the NBA was big, you can get in. If you were injured a lot but shined brightly when you played, you can get in. If you flat-out busted, you’re out.</p>

<p>Another thing with Laettner is that despite his long list of injuries in the NBA, his game was never predicated on athleticism, so the injuries shouldn’t have hampered him. I’ve seen Sampson and Manning thrown around as reasons why he should get in. Sampson was better than Laettner as a college player and was better in the NBA before the injuries. Manning carried that Kansas team to a championship (Laettner was good, but he was on super teams) and won a 6MOTY in the NBA.</p>

<p>Also, it’s not the Hall of Very Good. A member needs to have succeeded in all aspects, which Laettner clearly did not. Do you want us to put in Joe Barely Cares and Sam Bowie??? You want a college player? How about Rip Hamilton? He’s more deserving on both ends than Laettner. There <em>are</em> Duke players whose collegiate success will help get them in, though, such as JJ Redick. But putting in an NBA bust like Laettner would have horrible implications: think about the Harold Baines debacle with Cooperstown.</p>

      <label for="lblpaaf" class="commentText"><p>Because the skill gap between the NCAA and the NBA means being the GOAT of the NCAA isn&rsquo;t worth much.</p>

<p>This is also consistent with other sports.  Its also called the &ldquo;Pro Football Hall of Fame&rdquo;, and even though a player like Doug Flutie was a Pro Bowler after he became the GOAT of the CFL, and a Hall of Fame level NCAA career, he isn&rsquo;t a serious candidate either.  Someone like Anthony Calvillo set the all time professional football passing yards record, but he did it in the CFL, when the NFL is the premier league, so he isn&rsquo;t considered.</p>

<p>If you did open up the basketball hall of fame to lesser leagues, then you&rsquo;d have to seriously consider how you rank the NCAA to say, other leagues.  For example, the Carleton Ravens in Canada&rsquo;s university system have won 16 of the last 19 national championships and had an 87 game winning streak from 2003-2006.  So should we be inducting a bunch of them because they dominated a lesser league?  What about all the European leagues and their GOATs?</p>

Euro and college accomplishments are great but you gotta have a longer career. Derrick Rose might not make it in.</p>
