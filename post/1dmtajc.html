      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dmtajc/90s_nba_viewers_why_wasnt_the_karl_malone_scandal/"><p>90s NBA Viewers, why wasn&rsquo;t the Karl Malone scandal a bigger deal back then when Jerry Lee Lewis&rsquo;s Career was tanked by something similar?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>So obviously, everyone knows what happened with Karl Malone that I don&rsquo;t need to delve into the details. What I am curious about, however, is NBA fans here from the 90s days who were watching him become this two-time MVP winner and one of the corner stones of both the Dream Team and Jordan&rsquo;s Finals Runs - why didn&rsquo;t it affect him? It&rsquo;s not like scandals of this nature were unknown or downplayed: decades before, Jerry Lee Lewis had a career loss from marrying his underage cousin.</p>

<p>How did Malone manage to evade the scorn and outright become one of the most popular players of the 90s?</p>

But when the picture started becoming more and more obvious it was like OK well, I’m just going to take this jersey down and quietly buy an Andrei Kirilenko one to replace it. Woo AK47</p>

Around a decade ago there was a pretty disgusting rape case involving his students, and once the digging started, we learned he himself once got off a group rape case where several of his buddies were convicted - Why? Because he couldn&rsquo;t get hard.</p>

<p>There was lot of back and forth, some people leaving his teams and some schools breaking affiliation with him, but he still has UFC fighters happily getting coached by him.</p>

<p>I started watching the NBA in the early 80s, read sports sections and magazines religiously, and I wasn’t aware of Malone’s shit until after he retired.</p>

Why did it take 30 years for R Kelly to finally get punished while basically everyone knew that dude was doing illegal shit for at minimum the past 20 years. The stuff with Aaliyah was going on in the 90s. Dave Chappelle was making jokes back in the 2000s.</p>

<p>Same with Diddy. Everyone has known he’s a giant piece of shit since the 90s. Nobody did anything.</p>

<p>It’s like the world finally woke up in the past 10 years and started going after guys like Weinstein and Spacey. When is it Chris Browns turn?</p>

She said he gave her dating advice and would text her about how he misses her so much. The guy was 31 and she was 14 at the time btw. Not creepy at all&hellip; But yeah theres a few other curious cases.</p>

<p>Theres the time he showed up at Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s 16th birthday party and kissed her on the cheek, he texted Billie Eilish when she was I believe 17</p>

<p>And finally, by far the creepiest one of them all, theres this time where he (23 at the time) brings up a girl on stage asks her age, she says 17, and Drake says he cant go to jail yet. He proceeds to call her thicc, then says her breasts feel good, and he kisses her multiple times (on the hand, on the cheek, and on the lips). That list of events might be out of order, but they did all happen (Im not watching the whole video to make sure I got them in order). Here is a video of said incident:</p>

Like let’s say Steph Curry kicks his dogs and beats his maids. Unless one of the maids came with a video it wouldn’t make TMZ. If she had actual doctors records and witnesses she’d settle out of court for millions and the vast majority of people would forget it about it/ say well he wasn’t proven guilty! (Sorry Steph I know you don’t kick dogs!)</p>

<p>~7 minutes, he meets his first cousin’s 12-year-old daughter Myra</p>

<p>~10 minutes, he takes her into town “for a movie” but actually marries her at age 13</p>

<p>~11:15, Myra goes to London and gets asked by a reporter who she is; she says she’s Jerry’s wife because she doesn’t know any better but lies and says she’s 15</p>

<p>Anyway, nothing like that happened in real time with Karl Malone. Not a family member, no marriage, no international trips where his rape victim talked to the press.</p>

<p>Oh, and also the bigamy.</p>

<p>Jerry Lee Lewis was not just a piece of shit but <em>loudly</em> and <em>unapologetically</em> a piece of shit in a way that’s very rare. And he still had a long profitable career because the entertainment industry is an industry and money is all that matters.</p>

      <label for="l9ysj28" class="commentText"><p>No, it’s not a better-worse thing. It’s more to do with expiration date.</p>

<p>If you notice, in the music industry, nothing really comes out about someone until their sales drop and the money spigot turns off. Marilyn Manson and R. Kelly were known about for years, but they had to become has-beens for the whole ecosystem feeding off of them to dry up and stop protecting them.</p>

<p>Athletes have a lot smaller window, and except at the very top level, there’s always someone else up next. “Replacement level player” is a thing, there’s only so many roster spots, and the number of games are already guaranteed. It’s a lot easier to drop a horrible player and move on to someone with less baggage unless they’re in that Karl Malone/Kobe Bryant tier.</p>

<p>Sports isn’t more moral when it comes to owners, for example, or executives and such. They don’t have a ticking clock in the same way, so they will be protected for much longer like with the Dallas Mavericks culture of sexual harassment.</p>

<p>Anyway, “industry” is always the key thing because so long as you can externalize costs and harm on people who don’t matter (and young women and girls almost never matter) you can make a lot of money under capitalism.</p>

<p>Prior to that there rumors he had other kids than the ones he had with his wife. But people thought it was maybe some woman he was in school with. Similar to say Larry Bird or Magic, Dr J situations. They had babies with random women before they were famous with woman in their hometowns.</p>

<p>The stuff was very common back then for Men in General. No DNA testing, no real way to track people if they moved more than 50 miles away. I mean not everyone had SSN back then. Drivers Licenses lacked photos even.</p>

<p>My Grandfather had two separate families in a fairly large MW city back in the 60s. Best way to describe it&hellip;</p>

<p>Say I worked in Manhattan as a doorman. I could have a family in Harlem then another one in Brooklyn. As long as I sent the woman whatever agreed upon amount she wouldn&rsquo;t care. Plus she would get welfare.</p>

<p>Either way these men had a woman and children we all saw for camera and then another child(ren) that was around, but not on camera, Courtside, etc.</p>

<p>Who have to remember these guys were young&hellip;Bird won his first championship at 25?? His second or 3rd year in the league&hellip;by that point the woman and child were distant memory.</p>

<p>Just think Jayson Tatum is a similar age, we know he dropped one GF for the new one, and now he has another..Deuce is still by his side&hellip;40 years ago, Tatum would have been in college when that baby was born and would less inclined to bring him out in public.</p>

<p>I remember when Bronny was born and Lebron was playing with him Courtside after a game one-time after a Sunday game&hellip;people were livid because they felt the NBA were promoting out of wedlock births&hellip;</p>

<p>In an interview Lebron&rsquo;s second or 3rd year, a reporter asked him if him and Savanah were married his was response was &ldquo;if a chick is living your house you are married to her&rdquo;. In 2004-2005&rdquo;. that was controversial&hellip;it was a different world back then.</p>

<p>When ESPN Sports Century Documentaries was done&hellip;which was done in 1998-2000 counting down the top-100 athletes of 20th Century, it actually came up in his interview.</p>

<p>They actually interviewed his oldest daughter and she discussed at length how hard her and her mom struggled and how Larry absolutely refused any sort of relationship with her.</p>

<p>Larry just said and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing &ldquo;I know the truth and I don&rsquo;t worry about what people think&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yes a high profile beloved public figure having a child everyone knew about and he didn&rsquo;t take care of her was shocking to people.</p>

      <label for="l9z7k2z" class="commentText"><p>People weren’t shocked or outraged. It was basically a non-story. “Oh NFL player X has 8 kids with 8 woman and… Larry Bird has a kid from his first marriage? Ok…”</p>

<p>The only time it gets brought up is now, 45 years later, by oddballs on Reddit comparing a guy who had a daughter with his wife and got divorced to damn Karl Malone, who impregnated a 13 year old.</p>

<p>Like how broken is your sense of proportion?</p>

<p>Now, because people read these threads I should point out that Larry Bird is very private and doesn’t think he has to explain himself to you, but he did talk about it once. He explained that his ex wife was emotionally abusive to him and in his words she ruined his life causing him anxiety and intimacy issues that lasted half a decade. He did financially support his daughter but stayed out of her life as to avoid this woman.</p>

<p>Your strange mischaracterization of Bird’s situation and insertion of it in a thread about a rapist because you hate the Celtics or for whatever reason,  is pretty ugly behavior tbh.</p>

      <label for="l9zaoas" class="commentText"><p>Whoa&hellip;thats not what I&rsquo;m insinuating&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m saying, that when the story broke, it ran counter to Bird&rsquo;s image and it shocked people. It made people uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Just like when Jordan was hit with that paternity suit but it ended up being an extortion attempt it shocked people. Even though it was very public information that Jordan was a womanizer.</p>

<p>Just like when Dwight Howard knocked up a cheerleader it shocked people, it ran counter to his image. Now he has children all over the place&hellip;so nothing shocks anyone.</p>

<p>When Barry Sanders had a random baby in the mid-90s it shocked people here in Detroit, because it ran counter to his image.</p>

<p>Understand that in the 80s and 90s hearing that sports stars had children and they were not taking care of them and they were viewed as fairly well off was bad for the NBA&rsquo;s image.</p>

<p>When Shawn Kemp dropped 4 babies during the NBA lockout it shocked people and everyone knew he was a low-life.</p>

<p>The point is in Bird&rsquo;s situation this information was not public. It became public. It was covered. ESPN during his Sportscentury Profile felt it was important to interview her and discuss it. In no way am I trying to put that on the level of Karl Malone.</p>

<p>If Malone having a baby with 12 year old is a 8 on the Scumbag scale. A baby he refused to acknowledge basically until they became adults and pro athletes. Bird is 4, he still had a child and refuse to acknowledge her or raise her. Magic&rsquo;s is like a 1 and Dr. J is a 3 (I believe he cut a check, and was involved with the child once it became a teenager or he retired).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry everyone knew Lawrence Taylor was reckless and irresponsible. But when it came out Marshall Faulk had 6 babies by 5 different woman it took people by surprise.</p>

<p>If it came out Peyton Manning had 2 bastard children people would be shocked. On the flipside Ben Rothelesberger people would say &ldquo;man those are rookie numbers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If Lebron popped up with some extra kids it would hurt him. Meanwhile Carmelo is dropping babies all over the place&hellip;no one even cares.</p>

      <label for="l9ys0yl" class="commentText"><p>2000s NBA Viewers, why weren&rsquo;t the Kobe and Derrick Rose scandals a bigger deal back then when Jerry Lee Lewis&rsquo;s Career was tanked by something similar?</p>

<p>So obviously, everyone knows what happened with them that I don&rsquo;t need to delve into the details. What I am curious about, however, is NBA fans here from the 2000s days who were watching them become these one-time MVP winners and one of the corner stones of both the Redeem Team and many Finals Runs - why didn&rsquo;t it affect them? It&rsquo;s not like scandals of this nature were unknown or downplayed: decades before, Jerry Lee Lewis had a career loss from marrying his underage cousin.</p>

At the end of the day, America&rsquo;s a money driven society. Malone had the backing of people with shit loads of money. Nobody who knew about it was going to speak out about it because they no doubt would&rsquo;ve faced retaliation for it.</p>

<p>Even nowadays rich people caught doing fucked up shit usually get a slap on the wrist for it compared to normal people.</p>

<p>I don’t think we even knew he had older kids until the late 90s when a tabloid reported on it. And nobody took anything from tabloids very seriously then either. I’m pretty sure Malone also denied all of it until we’ll after he retired as well.</p>

But it&rsquo;s also kind of sad because people seem to really have no idea how little the bulk of the population of the U.S. gave a shit about sexual assault of Black people until very recently.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m watching back the 1997 and 1998 NBA Finals. Bob Costas (who i usually like a lot as a broadcaster) is trashing Rodman nonstop for his off the court antics. Malone is getting praised like the best human in the world.</p>

<p>NBA wanted to highlight Malone as a blue collar guy/hard worker for his on court work during his MVP run. Even in defeat, he&rsquo;s portrayed as this guy that reps everything good about basketball being gracious in defeat lol</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rodman was the devil for wearing a dress and having a wrestling career. TDLR: Media liked/protected Malone by giving him full benefit of doubt.</p>

It was also the same reason lots of nasty people at the top of their field get to hang around with open secrets like that. They simply are either especially irreplaceable or especially powerful. Neither lasts forever and that’s when things turn for them.</p>
