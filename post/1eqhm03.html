&ldquo;I would not rule out KD playing, and I talked with Team USA officials, and they would give him a provisional yes right now,&rdquo; ESPN&rsquo;s Brian Windhorst revealed during Monday&rsquo;s episode of The Hoop Collective (49:50 mark).</p>

<p>Plus he can easily transition into being one of the most OP spot up shooters ever if he chooses to do so, and on that US team, it would be an easy role for 5-10 minutes per night.</p>

      <label for="lhrthow" class="commentText"><p>I think KD has had more injuries at his age than LeBron has had all time, that&rsquo;s a factor to consider as to whether he can weather 4 more years of basketball and STILL be an elite contributor in the Olympics. Now he has as good a shot as any at the age he&rsquo;ll be because of how well his game will age, but I would say it&rsquo;s still less likely than more likely.</p>

      <label for="lhrxxpr" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think he will want to come back if he isn’t elite. Players like KD, Bron, Steph, I don’t think they wear out their welcome. They aren’t like harden or Westbrook or cp3 where they’re missing something. When the game goes down a level, I suspect they retire. Lebron probably the only one that might stay an extra year if his second son is draftable, outside of that I don’t think we live in a world where Lebron averages less than 20 a game.</p>

He is such a basketball obsessive, I think he&rsquo;s going to have a hard time letting the game go.

<p>LeBron is a one of one outlier for longevity and productivity at this age.</p>

<p>Even if KD looks like he’s on a LeBron track now, I wouldn’t expect him to stay on it (not rooting for injuries at all, just being realistic)</p>

<p>Also, I think we over-project how shooters will age. Very few great shooters remain productive late into their careers.</p>

<p>Now again, I’m not betting against KD and he’s a one of one in his own right. But personally I’d say it’s a low chance he competes in 4 years</p>

      <label for="lhs0hi6" class="commentText"><p>no not really. kawhi woulda been the best player that coulda played. probably best on the team as well seeing how everyone performed. bron will always run the offense whenever hes on a team i think its clear by this point. he plays well with aggressive players that can create for themselves but also that doesnt have too high on ball usage to let bron initiate offense. kyrie dwade ad. ofc these guys would be good with anyone as would bron as his skills cover so many different styles and positions. and personally i think brons best position would be on the wing off ball but i mean there was no way anyone was gunna get him off ball on that team lol</p>

<p>How old is Bam, he will be there.</p>

<p>Halliburton, Booker, Young</p>

<p>That guy that is supposed to go First overall next year</p>

<p>Banchero plays for USA right?</p>

<p>Donovan Mitchell will only be 31.</p>

<p>There’s also guys like Scottie Barnes, Cade, Mobley, Garland, Chet Homgrem, Fox</p>

<p>Even Embiid and Davis will be mid 30s like Durant, Curry rn. They could come back too</p>

<p>The big name star power of Curry,Durant and LeBron won’t be there</p>

<p>But the USA talent pool is deep. There’s no reason they couldn’t get another gold easy.</p>

<p>The women’s coach just refused to play the players who can’t provide ball pressure instead of scheming for them.</p>

<p>Which is especially egregious in Griner’s case, because she an excellent defensive player as long as you aren’t making her go out on the perimeter.</p>

      <label for="lhsblo8" class="commentText"><p>Meh, the last game she had real minutes in (quarterfinals), she was pretty good, even if she didn’t shoot good. Then she never got actual minutes again.</p>

<p>Also, Curry was awful - until he wasn’t. She’s a shooter and was capable of going off from three too. She’s had multiple 6+ 3 pointer games this season.</p>

<p>That being said, absolutely not playing Sabrina and BG was the worst choice. Sabrina has been the league’s best guard this season, brought shooting and play making - and BG is just a huge advantage.</p>

<p>It’s just..when the team is panicked, can’t shoot, and can’t pass…giving the games best 3 point shooter, one of the best passers, and most experienced player a shot would be a good choice, especially if for whatever reason Reeve didn’t seem to trust Sabrina.</p>

<p>USA was actually lucky Serbia missed shots at the end and USA iso offense produced, but that isn&rsquo;t a recipe for success at all.</p>

<p>They need to swing the ball better, player movement and have a more fluid offense. It was stale at dangerous times.</p>

<p>Coach decisions absolutely fucked with the women&rsquo;s teams mental. They were fucking up layups and making horrible shots. That gold medal game was a race to the bottom and I hope that forces the women&rsquo;s team to get a new coach and inject new blood at the next olympics. im still mad</p>

      <label for="lhs39sc" class="commentText"><p>Plenty of time for new names i believe. A lot of players are coming into age in the next 4 years and a lot of them have special potential. Here are my top picks:</p>

<p>PG: Scoot, Reed Shepperd
SG: Jalen Green
SF: Scottie Barnes, Keegan Murray, Brandon Miller
PF: JDub, Banchero, Evan Mobley
C: Chet, Lively, Kessler, Duren
Special mentions: Jaime Jacquez, Podz, Cason Wallace</p>

<p>I know, I know - none of these guys is close to the level required to be on the team now, but 4 years is a hell of a lot of time and I can see at least 5 of them making it onto the squad. If I had to put my money on it, I&rsquo;d pick Barnes, Banchero and Chet, but at the same time I&rsquo;m very bullish on Brandon Miller, Jacquez and Scoot.</p>

Winning 5 golds by yourself is different than 5 golds as part of a team. Hell Taurasi is at 6 now and people aren’t celebrating that achievement as much as Lopez’s 5.</p>

<p>If Durant goes for 5 that’s amazing for him but he isn’t chasing Mijain Lopez. If anything he is chasing Taurasi.</p>

I would love to see it but I don’t expect it, especially with his injury history</p>

<p>This would also be two years after his current contract ends, we don’t even know if he wants to play until 2028</p>
