      <label for="lib0fsh" class="commentText"><p>The best paint scorer and transition player of this generation is definitely a top 10 offensive player. Milwaukee has had a top 10 offense every year during Giannis’ prime and top 5 offense multiple seasons. </p>

<p>Giannis has averaged about 30 points/6 assists on 63 TS% since becoming an MVP caliber in the league. All time great driver, paint scorer, foul drawer, and transition player. There are not 10 players this past decade, who have better production or team effectiveness than that.</p>

      <label for="lib5kwt" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. However having listened to this, their rationale on giannis was playoffs. They argue that his efficiency drop off plus how other teams are able to scheme against him counts against this exercise. They cited the 2021 finals as an incredible series, and that if he had a couple more series as good as that he&rsquo;d be up there.</p>

<p>Giannis had what, 2 inefficient games in the Brooklyn series that championship season?  Feels disingenuous for them to act like he&rsquo;s only been an unstoppably destructive force in 1 series in his career.</p>

      <label for="libdui8" class="commentText"><p>There’s more to offense than scoring points. Giannis is a great transition finisher, but he doesn’t really create offense that much. If we were to look at career ORAPM for all the top guys except SGA (since he got a lot of his value last season and it hasn’t been updated for the last season yet) and Giannis, this is what we get:</p>

<p>Curry: 7.3</p>

<p>Jokic: 7.5</p>

<p>LeBron: 6.5</p>

<p>Luka: 4.8</p>

<p>Durant: 5.7</p>

<p>Harden 6.6</p>

<p>CP3: 5.9</p>

<p>Kawhi: 4.7</p>

<p>Lillard: 7.3</p>

<p>Giannis: 3.0</p>

<p>Giannis is an excellent all-around player, but he gets almost as much value from his defense as he does from his offense. His raw scoring totals don’t represent how much he lifts an offense.</p>

<p>This is the source. Giannis would be punished a bit for the slow start to his career but he probably has a higher percentage of prime seasons than someone like Harden or CP3 who’s already in their decline phase. SGA actually has a higher ORAPM than him too even with last season not included.</p>

      <label for="lic9nt8" class="commentText"><p>As someone without much experience with RAPM, what is the justification for the ranking having guys like Tony Allen, Brian Cardinal, and Joe Ingles ahead of guys like Love, Wade, Kobe, Kyrie, etc? Or why is Verajao right behind Marc Gasol and Dwight and ahead of Pau?</p>

<p>Even if its per minute and youre a Kobe truther or whatever, there&rsquo;s no way that playing X amount of Brian Cardinal minutes is better than playing the same of Wade or Love minutes or whatever. Obviously none of these all in one stats are perfect, but it feels like it &lsquo;correctly&rsquo; picked about half the players and then randomized the rest.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious what it tends to reward/penalize if a guy like Barkley can be as low as 162 behind Dragic and so on.</p>

      <label for="licogca" class="commentText"><p>It rewards scoring more points than the other team and penalizes scoring fewer points than the other team.</p>

<p>Model basketball as a linear equation. Add up the ratings for the 5 offense players, subtract the ratings for the 5 defense players (+ home court advantage + whatever else).</p>

<p>O1 + O2 + O3 + O4 + O5 - D1 - D2 - D3 - D4 - D5 = result</p>

<p>Now you look at the actual games - what the lineups were, and how many points were scored. Now do this for every single lineup in every single game. Run a giant linear regression (with regularization - basically assume most players are ~average).</p>

<blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>The eye test is misleading, especially for somebody like Kobe. He scored a bunch of points and looked really cool. But apparently his teams weren&rsquo;t actually that much better with him on the floor than off the floor (at least, when compared to other all-time greats).</p></li>

<li><p>This can be noisy, especially with low sample sizes and collinearity (hard to distinguish Steph vs Draymond since they play so much together). However, over huge multi-year samples it&rsquo;s basically correct. See point #1.</p></li>

      <label for="licqtz0" class="commentText"><p>Hmm. While interesting, it feels like there would be some need to be able to separate players by role/usage to get a better list of players from best to worst (not that this is what the stat is trying to do).</p>

<p>For example, a great role player who fits his roles very well will do very well here - your Derek Fishers, Jrue Holidays, Brian Cardinals, Luol Dengs, Nurkics, etc.</p>

<p>But obviously, if you made a team full of those guys, theyd be mediocre at best and trash at worst, while Wade-Ray Allen-Barkley-Pau-Dwight would be championship favorites, even with a far lower combined score.</p>

      <label for="licuohw" class="commentText"><p>Yep, it&rsquo;s context-dependent impact rather than raw skill. The value of a great role player is that you can put them next to an offensive star and they will still provide valuable impact.</p>

<p>I would argue that a Draymond (star-level impact with low offensive usage) is better than a lot of &ldquo;star&rdquo; offensive players. You win games by putting players together synergistically. The suns have KD and Booker, they were better off without trading for Beal even though Beal is a &ldquo;star&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Also, Charles Barkeley might be better than this. The 1997+ range doesn&rsquo;t include his peak.</p>

      <label for="lib544s" class="commentText"><p>When you look at his on-offs and how it affects his teams offense he lags behind a lot of other star players, probably due his poor outside shot and relatively limited playmaking. Similar to embiid a higher prorportion of giannis&rsquo; relative value comes on the defensive end despite the high ppg numbers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The team offence also becomes a stagnate 4 out catch and shoot lineup, which limits the ability of the rest of his team.</p>

<p>Giannis looks good with that simple lineup, but it is very easy to scheme against and when coaches try to switch it up, it is never quite as effective since Giannis doesn&rsquo;t have that much flexibility in his offensive game.</p>

<p>Probably why the breakout games for the other stars like Dame and Middleton tend to happen when he&rsquo;s off the floor.</p>

<p>I’m not sure where he was by the end of the year but in February he was fourth in the league in <a href="https://x.com/JADubin5/status/1758497218556764517" target="_blank">unrealized assists</a> and the looks he was creating for his teammates were far better than Jokic’s.</p>

      <label for="licu8l1" class="commentText"><p>This podcast looks to specifically talk about players who create &ldquo;pace and space&rdquo; rather than just offensive players overall.  I have now listened to part of the podcast, and they talk about big men like KAT, Love, how Blake Griffin was quite good and then Giannis (starts at about 15:10 and ends at 24:30).  They give him his flowers for sure, talk about how they will be gored by The Deer when this comes out, and Cody casually says &ldquo;Yes, I hate Milwaukee basketball&rdquo; in his sarcastic way.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk on this, they mention that they evaluated based on regular season and playoffs statistics with efficiency and his just didn&rsquo;t match up with the others on the list with their specific criteria.</p>

That said, giannis has improved tremendously as a passer, I was very impressed with that part of his game in the 2023 playoffs even though they lost to Miami. Paired with his goat level transition game and rim pressure, it can elevate him overall as an offensive package.</p>

      <label for="lib5cks" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. I don’t think it’s a knock on harden to be behind those guys. Luka is super productive and has a more robust bag. He’s just as good of a passer as Harden but he adds in postups, better finishing within 10ft, really fun circus shots etc. Lebron is…Lebron.</p>

<p>I get that Luka has a bit more of a bag, but Harden was statistically a better scorer at his peak (even if you adjust it by possessions)</p>

<p>In his four years without D&rsquo;Antoni, Harden&rsquo;s offenses ranked 6th, 4th, 12th and 7th as he averaged 27/5/7, GREAT numbers, but not exactly ground breaking. Then D&rsquo;Antoni walks through the door in 2016 and basically Harden becomes Steve Nash 2.0 in terms of offensive impact, leading the Rockets to the 2nd, 1st, 2nd and 6th best offenses in a four year stretch while averaging 32/7/9, something that definitely would put him among the five greatest offensive players ever. He was a part of another No.1 ranked offense in Brooklyn in 2021, but it needs to be said that he only played 36 games that year and the Nets had a Top 3 offense with him off the floor either way.</p>

<p>I do think Harden is one of the 4 best offensive players of the last 10 years and i&rsquo;d definitely rank him ahead of Doncic given that Luka only played in six of those years, but one can make an argument that Harden&rsquo;s rise to become a generational offensive player came from D&rsquo;Antoni&rsquo;s offensive system, as before he was &ldquo;just&rdquo; a really good offensive player.</p>

      <label for="libjx62" class="commentText"><p>Thinking Basketball literally has an indepth video including advanced statistical analysis of various great players and Harden ranks among the very lowest.</p>

<p>It is not about the result of whether he can beat 3-4 all stars by himself, that&rsquo;s not even the argument.</p>

<p>It is literally in his numbers. Both the advanced numbers, the raw numbers, the basic numbers, and even the eye test paint Harden as one of the worst playoff underperformers in NBA history [compared to other stars] in his prime. That&rsquo;s not against one team, but many many teams in the playoffs as a Rocket..</p>

<p>It is straight up delusion for anyone to consider Harden as not a playoff underperformer. Let me repeat, <em>every</em> statistical analysis from advanced stats to basic stats all point to Harden&rsquo;s decline, and it&rsquo;s not just a normal decline, but a <em>steep</em> decline. And then to top it all off it is backed up by the eye test.</p>

<p>Okay. Well please point out these stats to me if every single one of them says so.</p>

<p>I would like to see the unbiased statistic that is able to measure how Harden is the biggest underperformer relative to his peers. That sounds really interesting to be honest. Mostly because I have a master in statistics and can’t for the life of me comprehend how you would create a statistical framework for measuring something like that.</p>

<p>Both are impressive and if you have Embiid over Kawhi I get it. I’m just saying I didn’t find his inclusion odd or anything.</p>

      <label for="libzhjn" class="commentText"><p>Embiid&rsquo;s health has a lot to do with his post season regression, it&rsquo;s probably who he is atp but he&rsquo;s been an absolute beast when healthy. </p>

<p>Also yeah, I didn&rsquo;t realise how good Kawhi&rsquo;s post season numbers were so mb. It&rsquo;s not Kawhi in particular it just feels odd to not have Embiid in the top 10 at all, I&rsquo;d probably bump Shai out.</p>

      <label for="lic05pf" class="commentText"><p>Tbh I was impressed by his postseason numbers in spite of his injuries!  Like I knew he was really good abasing the Knicks this year but I forgot how well he played overall in some of those other series.  I was thinking he’d have like 56% TS or something, but his numbers are still pretty damn good.</p>

<p>100% agree on SGA.  They didn’t include Giannis and Embiid because of the postseason stuff but SGA barely has a playoff resume so it doesn’t really seem fair to me, plus his scoring dipped quite a bit in the middle of this season when the refs stopped calling fouls.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t too much here to really scrutinize. Also, this is OFFENSIVE players. I&rsquo;m kinda shocked he has Kawhi as high as he does. After all, a lot of the value that comes from Kawhi is that he is an elite 2-way player.</p>

<p>And honestly, I&rsquo;d rather Joel, Russ, or Trae over either of SGA or Kawhi.</p>

<p>In fact, LeBron’s on-court offensive rating of 118.2 in the playoffs was not all that far from Steph’s on-court offensive rating of 119.0 in the <em>regular season</em>.</p>

<p>And if we limit it to just the regular season, Steph and LeBron shared an identical +13.6 offensive on/off (both of their teams had a offensive rating 13.6 pts higher with them on the court).</p>

<p>Here’s a fun fact: the 2015-17 Cavaliers had the 3rd  highest relative offensive rating in the playoffs ever for a 3 yr span, and the highest ever using common offensive rating (both metrics that adjust for opposing defense quality). That’s with Love/Kyrie injured in 2015 and LeBron nursing a back injury.</p>

<p>LeBron was much better than people think he was during Steph’s peak; Steph was just the new kid on the block so obviously gets more attention.</p>

      <label for="lics5id" class="commentText"><p>Just an FYI, Thinking Basketball constantly emphasizes that Kawhi isn&rsquo;t an elite 2-way player in the way that we often fantasize him to be (DPOY + Mid-range Iso Master). Mainly because those 2 versions of Kawhi never really existed at the same time. I don&rsquo;t really like Kawhi that high either, but they generally value how stable his offensive game is regardless of the playoff defense adjustments made on him.</p>

<p>Although I haven&rsquo;t listened, I know they tend to skew their value towards playoff performance AND general playstyle adjustability. Curry/Jokic/LeBron can all adjust to different reads and coverages extremely well, while still maintaining their value. This tends to be valued very highly by the podcast. Whereas someone like Harden, who has shown to be schemed against successfully in the playoffs, gets docked quite a bit. Joel, Russ, and Trae have shown that inability to adjust to some degree as well. It&rsquo;s probably also why Giannis got knocked down as well. SGA is an odd take for me, because there&rsquo;s just no data on the guy.</p>

<p>but at some point it really is just about getting it done, and no one got it done like 2012-2020 lebron in the playoffs</p>

<p>even at 39 he just averaged 28/7/9 on 64% TS</p>

<p>and at some point it&rsquo;s about who&rsquo;s just the most unstoppable, and it is LeBron, he can legit handle the ball every time down, playmake, be a roll man, post up, shoot threes, and he&rsquo;s the greatest driver of all time</p>

      <label for="liau67f" class="commentText"><p>Well the greatest offensive player ever is not the most unstoppable player, it&rsquo;s the player that increases your teams offensive rating the most on average. If you look at it that way it makes sense that Jokic and Steph are at one and two. All three of them have a pretty good argument so it&rsquo;s kind of splitting hairs but I do think Jokic and Steph have reached the highest highs offensively post 2014. Though there is probably more uncertainty with Jokic and especially Curry&rsquo;s low range, which is Lebron&rsquo;s best argument here.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how you have to think when isolating offense ONLY like this is because just saying &ldquo;well LeBron has been to the Finals X times&rdquo; also brings defense in the picture</p>

      <label for="licl3mz" class="commentText"><p>But I won&rsquo;t put him over James Harden.</p>

<p>A Prime James Harden had the greatest scoring season we have ever seen from a player.</p>

<p>He had no offensive weakness those season in Houston.</p>

<p>Steph, was basically a ticking time bomb. He got 30 with ease.</p>

<p>Jokic provides more value as a passer when comparing him to the other players.</p>

<p>Lebron in 2018 was the single greatest personal achievement that any player in the history of the sport will ever achieve when he became the first player to take a team that didn&rsquo;t have a single 15 point scorer outside of LeBron. Beat the Pacers, Raptors and Celtics. Had one of the greatest finals game 1 ever only to be chocked on by JR Smith.</p>

<p>Became the first player to lead both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks against 4 HOFs.</p>

      <label for="lic5c4c" class="commentText"><p>If you were to remove the 2.5 epm season where he only played 5 games, his total accumulated epm would go down but his avg offensive epm would go up. Accounting for the total missed games would not reflect positively or negatively on total or avg offensive epm. It would just indicate that it was done on less total volume. The accumulation value I used may have been better represented by total offensive effective win shares instead of adding together estimated offensive +/- values that are averages for each season.</p>

      <label for="libojjw" class="commentText"><p>The podcast was named incorrectly imo. They weren&rsquo;t talking about a body of work, more like the best season or two for each player. Because otherwise Shai shouldn&rsquo;t be mentioned. But then on the other hand, when talking about negatives, they seemed to use the body of work. So that also benefited Shai since he&rsquo;s barely been in the playoffs.</p>
