      <label for="l9socvq" class="commentText"><p>Also not that swimming is an obscure sport by any means but I just rarely see people discuss this&hellip; Katie Ledecky is so wildly dominant in the history of women&rsquo;s swimming that it&rsquo;s hard to process. She&rsquo;s the Bradman, the Gretzky of women&rsquo;s swimming.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s too many fucked up, unbelievable stats about her to list even a fraction of them but I&rsquo;ll pick just one as an example. </p>

<p>At the 2016 Olympics she broke the women&rsquo;s 800m freestyle world record in the process of winning the gold medal. This record being one that she had set herself the previous week, and not for the first time. With her new record, she now held the <em>13</em> fastest times for the event, having repeatedly broken it and lowered her time by 11 seconds (a ridiculous amount in the context of swimming) over the past 3 years. She was 19 years old at the time. </p>

Again probably a stupid line to draw, but it helps me compartemalize sports better.</p>

      <label for="l9szwm7" class="commentText"><p>I’m not going to argue that Ledecky isn’t the women’s swimming GOAT (she is), but I don’t think it’s as cut and dry as most people think. She’s been absolutely dominant in distance free, and one of the best in the world at mid distance free. But that’s just one stroke, and not even all of the distances of that stroke. There are definitely more well rounded female swimmers (Katinka Hosszu might get my vote). Sun Yang is probably the greatest male freestyler of all time, but no one is gonna put him ahead of guys like Phelps or Lochte.</p>

<p>NBA players face similar criticism. Shaq might have been more dominant at his peak than LeBron, but LeBron is the better and more complete player.</p>

<p>Also can be applied within individual sports it&rsquo;s harder to be the best basketball player today than 1970 because the player pool has expanded by the millions.</p>

Barring people with certain disabilities, everybody can theoretically compete in the 100m and 200m dash. And yet Bolt holds the WR in both (and the top 3 times in the 100m).  And it doesn’t seem like anyone is going to be challenging those records for awhile.</p>

      <label for="l9su9ls" class="commentText"><p>I still contend it’s harder to be the best sprinter. Anecdotally but my elementary school growing up had a race every year where every student in your classroom would compete in a sprint and then all the winners would race to see who the fastest kid in school is. I imagine lots of schools/towns across the world have similar “who is the fastest” where almost everybody competes. Soccer requires some level of access to get into the ranks whereas sprinting can get anybody on the planet noticed.</p>

<p>Of course, there are more people competing in soccer in a formal capacity, but I’d argue more people globally have competed in a race against others than have competed in some form of soccer.</p>

<p>And to extend the conversation to other kinds of wrestling, in Sumo there&rsquo;s Hakuho, whose accomplishments are similarly chamberlain-esque, being tied for the most consecutive championships, having the most undefeated championships (in tournaments where you wrestle multiple times and best record wins) by double what the next guy has, the most career championships at 45 (and if you only counted those 13 he has over the next guy that would still place him as the 8th most ever) , the most career match wins, the most top division wins, the most wins in a single year tied with <em>himself</em> (He also ties for the 4th &amp; 6th spots) the list just goes on and it doesn&rsquo;t even fully cover how insane this dude was.</p>

      <label for="l9stw7y" class="commentText"><p>This actually already happened. As part of their 100th anniversary celebrations, the league launched a new Stats site and did a massive audit of all stats prior to like 1989 or something. This included a few adjustments and because they were reviewing game tape, it also included recording stats that weren&rsquo;t introduced until years later. Gretzky&rsquo;s stats should all be considered accurate at this point.</p>

<p>They also did an in-season audit this season on their Hits stat for the season because they didn&rsquo;t feel it was as accurate as it should be.</p>

<p>I agree that Kobe has global appeal, but I&rsquo;ve been to several countries where I even didn&rsquo;t see a court, Basketball is not a houshold sport in every country.</p>

<p>Thats not the question, the question is stardom/starpwer and he was the most famous football player in the world, with football being the biggest sport in the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He made his debut on 31 March as a substitute against Los Angeles FC in the inaugural El Tráfico derby, where he scored twice, including a 45-yard (41 m) half volley and a header in stoppage time, helping the Galaxy come from three goals down to win the match 4–3.[182] After his match-winning performance, Ibrahimović said, &ldquo;I heard the crowd saying &lsquo;We want Zlatan, we want Zlatan&rsquo;, so I gave them Zlatan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jordan/Frank Thomas are the only two I can think of, but neither Thomas/Ortiz are close to Ohtani&rsquo;s popularity.</p>

<p>Sammy Sosa was though. Easy to forget now but he was mega popular during his peak. The home run chases with him, McGwire, and Griffey were the biggest things going in American sports. I&rsquo;m not sure if MJ/Sosa &lsquo;98 was bigger than Lebron/Ohtani, but it&rsquo;s definitely close.</p>

<p>If you google any &ldquo;most well known or most popular &rdquo; person in the world list, messi is top 5.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet at least 4 billion people on earth knows who messi is, and that&rsquo;s a conservative estimate. Last world cup final alone had 1.5 billion viewers live, they have to know him.</p>

<p>Final game of mass and Celtics had 12.2 million.</p>

<p>Billion vs millions. It&rsquo;s not even a question, nba doesn&rsquo;t scale like that. You are correct.</p>
