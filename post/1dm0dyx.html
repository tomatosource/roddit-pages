      <label for="l9socvq" class="commentText"><p>Also not that swimming is an obscure sport by any means but I just rarely see people discuss this&hellip; Katie Ledecky is so wildly dominant in the history of women&rsquo;s swimming that it&rsquo;s hard to process. She&rsquo;s the Bradman, the Gretzky of women&rsquo;s swimming.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s too many fucked up, unbelievable stats about her to list even a fraction of them but I&rsquo;ll pick just one as an example. </p>

<p>At the 2016 Olympics she broke the women&rsquo;s 800m freestyle world record in the process of winning the gold medal. This record being one that she had set herself the previous week, and not for the first time. With her new record, she now held the <em>13</em> fastest times for the event, having repeatedly broken it and lowered her time by 11 seconds (a ridiculous amount in the context of swimming) over the past 3 years. She was 19 years old at the time. </p>

Again probably a stupid line to draw, but it helps me compartemalize sports better.</p>

      <label for="l9szwm7" class="commentText"><p>I’m not going to argue that Ledecky isn’t the women’s swimming GOAT (she is), but I don’t think it’s as cut and dry as most people think. She’s been absolutely dominant in distance free, and one of the best in the world at mid distance free. But that’s just one stroke, and not even all of the distances of that stroke. There are definitely more well rounded female swimmers (Katinka Hosszu might get my vote). Sun Yang is probably the greatest male freestyler of all time, but no one is gonna put him ahead of guys like Phelps or Lochte.</p>

<p>NBA players face similar criticism. Shaq might have been more dominant at his peak than LeBron, but LeBron is the better and more complete player.</p>

      <label for="l9su9ls" class="commentText"><p>I still contend it’s harder to be the best sprinter. Anecdotally but my elementary school growing up had a race every year where every student in your classroom would compete in a sprint and then all the winners would race to see who the fastest kid in school is. I imagine lots of schools/towns across the world have similar “who is the fastest” where almost everybody competes. Soccer requires some level of access to get into the ranks whereas sprinting can get anybody on the planet noticed.</p>

<p>Of course, there are more people competing in soccer in a formal capacity, but I’d argue more people globally have competed in a race against others than have competed in some form of soccer.</p>

      <label for="l9t5isr" class="commentText"><p>I think part of the discussion should also be the fact that sports with contention for GOAT status are a little diminished just because multiple people are capable. Like in soccer you have Messi and Ronaldo, and if you go further back people like Pele, but going back runs into the same issue with other sports like basketball where Lebron and MJ are in contention but Lebron had to do it against objectively better players and teams than MJ did. Same with Chess and Magnus+Kasparov. Magnus is clearly better and has played against much better opponents, but he did it in the age of the supercomputer and Kasparov didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>With sports like running or swimming or whatever, there are literal clear GOATs and there is no if ands or buts about it, because those people were so dominant over their competitors that even if you put them back in time they&rsquo;d almost assuredly do the same.</p>

      <label for="l9sooji" class="commentText"><p>If it’s a “biggest star” discussion, yeah. If it’s “best athlete”, then imo it should be about how many people give  the sport enough of a try to know whether they’d be great at it. </p>

<p>For example, outside of the Olympics, hockey might be as popular to watch as track and field, but the talent pool is tiny compared to the 100m.</p>

In my opinion he is the most dominant sportsman, at least in a team sport, of all time.  His dominance and his origins considering the nature and history of Cricket makes it even more absurd.  The glory he led his country to against the English and what that meant only adds to his absurd legend.  I highly reccomend anyone look further into it if you&rsquo;re interested in sports history.  I don&rsquo;t watch cricket or anything but I love learning about paradigm destroying figures who come from humble origins.</p>

<p><sup>887</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in his career with 3 Olympic Gold Medals, one Silver</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the loss to Rulon Gardner at that Olympics was complete bullshit. The rules of wrestling are of course pretty simple, you score points to win by pinning someone, throwing them, or pushing them out of the ring. However, <em>for just that Olympics</em> they added a new rule called the &ldquo;clinch rule&rdquo; which said that if you clinch your hands together around your opponent and then your hands come unclinched then your opponent gets a point basically for stopping you. So the finals pit Aleksandr Karelin, the greatest wrestler who ever lived, who had been undefeated for 13 years and hadn&rsquo;t even had anyone score a single point against him for 6 years versus Rulon Gardner whose strategy was to be too fat and sweaty to fight. During their match, Karelin tried to flip Gardner over but his hands came unclinched because of how fat and sweaty Gardner was and just like that Gardner managed to score a point and win 1-0. The rule was immediately removed afterwards because everyone realized how fucking stupid it was.</p>

      <label for="l9stw7y" class="commentText"><p>This actually already happened. As part of their 100th anniversary celebrations, the league launched a new Stats site and did a massive audit of all stats prior to like 1989 or something. This included a few adjustments and because they were reviewing game tape, it also included recording stats that weren&rsquo;t introduced until years later. Gretzky&rsquo;s stats should all be considered accurate at this point.</p>

<p>They also did an in-season audit this season on their Hits stat for the season because they didn&rsquo;t feel it was as accurate as it should be.</p>

<p>I agree that Kobe has global appeal, but I&rsquo;ve been to several countries where I even didn&rsquo;t see a court, Basketball is not a houshold sport in every country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also is Beckham a top 10 all time in his sport? Lol</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats not the question, the question is stardom/starpwer and he was the most famous football player in the world, with football being the biggest sport in the world.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia summary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He made his debut on 31 March as a substitute against Los Angeles FC in the inaugural El Tráfico derby, where he scored twice, including a 45-yard (41 m) half volley and a header in stoppage time, helping the Galaxy come from three goals down to win the match 4–3.[182] After his match-winning performance, Ibrahimović said, &ldquo;I heard the crowd saying &lsquo;We want Zlatan, we want Zlatan&rsquo;, so I gave them Zlatan.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9td7mv" class="commentText"><p>Never have I ever heard <em>anyone</em> refer to OC as “LA suburbs”. LA has suburbs of their own. Completely different vibes, municipalities, and geographical makeup. OC stretches from La Habra to fucking San Clemente. If it was one city or two, sure, but we’re talking about an entire county here.</p>

<p>If you google any &ldquo;most well known or most popular &rdquo; person in the world list, messi is top 5.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet at least 4 billion people on earth knows who messi is, and that&rsquo;s a conservative estimate. Last world cup final alone had 1.5 billion viewers live, they have to know him.</p>

<p>Final game of mass and Celtics had 12.2 million.</p>

<p>Billion vs millions. It&rsquo;s not even a question, nba doesn&rsquo;t scale like that. You are correct.</p>

<p>Jordan/Frank Thomas are the only two I can think of, but neither Thomas/Ortiz are close to Ohtani&rsquo;s popularity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sammy Sosa was though. Easy to forget now but he was mega popular during his peak. The home run chases with him, McGwire, and Griffey were the biggest things going in American sports. I&rsquo;m not sure if MJ/Sosa &lsquo;98 was bigger than Lebron/Ohtani, but it&rsquo;s definitely close.</p>

<p>Edit: The people who say they don’t know who Walter Payton is; he was one of the greatest players in NFL history, he broke Jim Brown’s career rushing record and it stood until it was passed by Emmitt Smith. Payton was the star player on the historic 1985 Super Bowl shuffle Bears.</p>
