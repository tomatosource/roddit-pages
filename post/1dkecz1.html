<p>In the David Beckham documentary he talked about how he wanted to quit soccer due, to his dad basically forced him and criticizing him to the point where he was crying every day due to verbal abuse after games. But like his “conclusion” was that it was the right thing to do since he became a great player due to it</p>

<p>Tbh I can understand being frustrated that a clearly talented kid isnt giving it 100% but tbh I don’t think sacrificing a kid childhood is worth the slim shot of greatness</p>

I think he would’ve been great still without the more intensely abusive moments, but probably not without his dad being so involved and committed to his basketball development, instilling discipline and setting a high standard. Even if his dad was more abusive than he needed to be, I feel like it’s at least better than being absent.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people with abusive parents never become highly &ldquo;successful&rdquo; because of how difficult it is to overcome that abuse as a child. How come they didn&rsquo;t they all benefit from the luxury of having that &ldquo;discipline &amp; higher standard&rdquo;?</p>

      <label for="l9hlefe" class="commentText"><p>I’m not condoning the abusive parts or suggesting they in particular helped him…. ? I’m saying clearly not all of it was abuse.  Some was just tough, work ethic-oriented parenting.  Like waking him up, making sure he practices, instilling discipline, trying to teach him a tough mentality.  And just being there, being present, being a leadership figure in his life, coaching his teams.</p>

<p>It’s hard to parse it out and say his father was a net negative influence on his life, just because he took parts of it too far.</p>

<p>No one is going to admit that because it&rsquo;s a lie perpetuated by abusers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry because it&rsquo;s clear you were raised this way&ndash;it&rsquo;s unfair for a child to ever have to deal with this.  Learn from it and NEVER repeat it to your kids.  If you don&rsquo;t think you can, don&rsquo;t have kids&ndash;you owe them that much, at least.</p>

<p>I recommend watching them on YT if ppl are interested. (Ppl seem to have the idea that JT was a rich, AAU prodigy-type kid with an easy background just bc he worked with Drew Hanlen from his teen years onwards or something lol, but these interviews go super in depth to what his life was actually like. It was pretty much the opposite of that stereotype that many ppl, especially those who hate him, seem to have).</p>
