<p>The dress code is not really enforced anymore and Young black rich fashion has changed a fair bit too. But It was back then, if you didn&rsquo;t come to games in formal attire, a suit or something close to a suit. You would have to sit in the locker room.</p>

AI was very polarizing. Both on and off the court.</p>

<p>In basketball circles coaches appreciated his effort and willingness to force action when it was obvious the NBA was going in a different direction style wise. But they disliked his decision-making, shot selection, defensive effort and one-man show style.</p>

<p>Cultural it was very divided&hellip;on one hand, he represented a very present street culture that was always around the NBA but was sanitized. Iverson leaving Georgetown after his sophmore year was a seismic shift in player development. Before when guys left that early it was they had nothing left to prove. Magic won a title, so did Isiah Thomas. CWebb went to back to back Final Fours and everyone saw he was a man amongst boys in the NCAA. So guys leaving early typically were seen as, media friendly, and great players.</p>

<p>AI was the exact opposite&hellip;baggage plus we didn&rsquo;t know how the game would translate. Plus Georgetown never made a Final Four. So, historically a player like AI who fell just short in a Regional Final would comeback in 1997 with an epic showdown looming with Kentucky or UNC in the East or South Regional Final. AI would have been presumed #1 Pick in his Junior Year, and it would have been basically a full year marketing campaign.</p>

<p>AI and KG really ushered in the era of&hellip;look these guys are poor, from tough situations, have no interest in academics so they should just get paid. Before them, schools really did care that these players come to college mature as young adults, and enter into the NBA ready to succeed.
That model had fallen apart years ago, but it was always pointed to drugs (think of 1986 draft class).</p>

<p>AI and KG was the sportsworld admitting openly &lsquo;college aint for everyone&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Huh? That&rsquo;s a made-up narrative. Iverson didn&rsquo;t start that movement, it was already in full swing by 1996.</p>

<p>Chris Jackson/Mahmoud Abdul Rauf went pro after his soph season in 90. Kenny Anderson went pro after his soph season in 91. What did they prove in college, that they had nothing left to accomplish at that level?</p>

<p>You mention Webber - the guy drafted after him was Shawn Bradley, who entered the draft after his freshman season.</p>

<p>The following year, Jason Kidd went pro after his soph season.</p>

<p>The year before Iverson, the top 5 of the draft went: Joe Smith (soph), Antonio McDyess (soph), Jerry Stackhouse (soph), Rasheed Wallace (soph), Kevin Garnett (HS).</p>

<p>In Iverson&rsquo;s draft year, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stephon Marbury, Antoine Walker, and Lorenzen Wright also went in the top 10 as freshmen or sophomores.</p>

<p>Not all these guys were poor either. Kidd was from a rich family and was big in AAU circles.</p>

<p>AI&rsquo;s feud with David Stern came to a head because of an anti-gay and anti-women rap song. I don&rsquo;t know how you would justify that as being african-american culture. He had an album full of it that he cancelled.</p>

<p>It was way more than that but people just grabbed parts they liked to be outraged.</p>

      <label for="lmcvbln" class="commentText"><p>Yeah not surprising at all if you watch any game from then.</p>

<p>FTs largely came from packed paints + post up scoring. The rate of paint scoring hasn&rsquo;t changed at all either. So you can&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;jumpshots&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I love this era, basketball is so free flowing atm. You have tight playoff games where both teams take a total of like 25 FTs.</p>

<p>I remember growing up watching Finals games where both teams would collectively take like 70-90 FTs. It was exhausting.</p>

He paved the way for players getting paid ridiculous sums now and creating far more household names. He professionalized the NBA.</p>

<p>Boogie always played well, Kings were just shit. Boogie is just not an MVP level player, he&rsquo;s not going to turn a 20 win team into a 45 win team. He was just taking a 15-20 win team and making them 30ish wins.</p>

<p>We saw that as soon as he went to the Pels, they were awesome. Sadly he just got injured.</p>

<p>Agreed. And if you put Iverson in the 2010s West instead of the late 90s/early 00s East, we&rsquo;d be saying something similar about him.</p>

<p>This is a lie. He literally contributed heavily to winning. His teams struggled hard without him, they could not win without him there.</p>

<p>The 22 win team was led by Stackhouse, not Rookie AI and the fact that you&rsquo;re using a rookie season to prove your point says it all mate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No we would not, because that would mean him playing without handchecking. Which means he wouldn&rsquo;t be bogged down by the isolation heavy offense sticky defense of the time.</p>

<p>Kings didn&rsquo;t struggle because they were in the 2010s West. They were not a 2009 Warriors or 2015 Thunder type team. They were just shit. Boogie was not good enough to carry a team to anything past 30ish wins.</p>

<p>Not to mention, we literally saw Russ carry teams in the west during that same decade. One season to 45 wins and another to 47. This is what AI led teams would have looked like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yep. And they only made it out of the 2nd round once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that meant to prove your point. You called him Boogie&hellip;. Boog couldn&rsquo;t even lead his team to a winning record, let alone make it out of the first round.</p>

<p>The 22 win team was led by Stackhouse, not AI</p>

<p>Weird because Iverson played more minutes and took more shots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that would mean him playing without handchecking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We saw Iverson play in the post hand-checking era. He was basically the same guy he ever was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we literally saw Russ carry teams in the west during that same decade. One season to 45 wins and another to 47. This is what AI led teams would have looked like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have it your way then. Russ was crazy overrated too.</p>

      <label for="lmekikd" class="commentText"><p>Looking through Iverson&rsquo;s stats through his &lsquo;01 Finals run, he was efficiently the Sixers worst player. Dude had a horrible series against the Bucks, shot 34% and it went all the way 7 games. Show me an example of another player shooting 34% while averaging 30.5 PPG, it&rsquo;s absurd. He didn&rsquo;t carry no team, the league carried him to the Finals.</p>

<p>East has been weak for 26 years. Time to let it go. Finals runs are impressive.</p>
