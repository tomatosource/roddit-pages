Prior to the draft, free agency, and trades, which 5 teams do you think will miss the playoffs? Mavs, T’wolves, Nuggets, Thunder,  Clippers, Suns Lakers, Pelicans, Kings, Warriors, Rockets, Jazz or Grizzlies?</p>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Next season in my opinion will be extremely interesting. I’m very curious to see if teams such as the Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings,and Golden State warriors make a comeback. I’m also expecting some of those younger teams like the Houston Rockets, and Utah Jazz to make a legit playoff push.</p>

<p>Jk we’re in a 1 team race for last. What an insane lineup of teams. You can expect a team or two to fall out due to injury, and I don’t think the Jazz will be in the race at the end, but that is 12 good teams for 8 spots</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot about the Spurs. Along with the Jazz I expect them to be somewhat competitive but fall out of the race</p>

      <label for="l6xsxzk" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve lived for well over a decade in both the DC area and Portland. The fan and team culture of the Blazers is light years better than the Wizards. The Blazers have been on a downturn for several years now, because Paul Allen died and his sister runs the team as a financial asset. But it&rsquo;s a much stronger franchise, with a way more competitive culture and engaged fanbase. And even though both teams have just one &lsquo;chip, in the &lsquo;70&rsquo;s, the Blazers have been consistently competitive since then, while the Bullets/Wizards have consistently sucked.</p>

On one hand you are 100% right that GSW is set up to hit the FA/trade market hard. On the other&hellip;who&rsquo;s out there that can keep the Warriors from facing the same fate that has to come to any dynasty?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going on a decade of low/no R1 draft picks (except for the Wiseman disaster). They have two (3?) nightmare salaries on the books in Paul, Wiggins, and Dray. And the other guys are still toss-ups as to what they are/how good they could be (Moody, Kuminga, Podz).</p>

<p>Just feels like too much wasted cap &amp; too much to fix to get a real contender around Steph. Might even argue you need to strip down EVERYTHING but Curry and build it from scratch.</p>

Wemby is only 20 and it&rsquo;s not like the roster is only one piece away from contention.  Better off just sucking for another year or two and building a core of good young talent.</p>

      <label for="l6xh9fy" class="commentText"><p>The least injured. I think the ones you can probably bank on are the good, young deep teams like the Mavericks, Thunder, Wolves. I also think you can put the Nuggets here because they had the Murray injury and were still really great even losing depth too.</p>

<p>Teams reliant on older guys like the Clippers, Warriors, Lakers, Suns I&rsquo;d be wary about unless they find upgrades that can help carry the load.</p>

<p>Pelicans and Grizzlies are often injured but good enough to jump the 4 older teams imo if they stay healthy.</p>

<p>Kings and Rockets have a solid foundation but there&rsquo;s still something about them that has me hesitant to move them out of play-in caliber which is just down to 1 game.</p>

<p>I think just based on talent, Jazz and Blazers are going to miss it again, and the Spurs are dependent on how dominant Wemby is and if they get him some help.</p>

<p>#11 and #12 will be whoever is dealing with the most injuries, like what happened to the Grizzlies this year.</p>

      <label for="l6xds6f" class="commentText"><p>The Lakers and Warriors are two teams with older players who are clearly on the decline. The Warriors just barely made the play-in this year so I think the chance of them making the playoffs isn’t that high. Although Lebron’s decline has been slow, it was pretty obvious last year and I would be that it continues next year. AD is great, but I don’t think I would bet on them to make the playoffs with how stacked the West is.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the following teams make the playoffs as constructed presently: Mavs, Thunder, Nuggets, T-Wolves, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Suns, Clippers.</p>

      <label for="l6xq6z8" class="commentText"><p>We may see a full changing of the guard. The old guys played the most games they&rsquo;ve played in years. And it didn&rsquo;t even get any of them past the first round.</p>

<p>GSW - healthy Steph and Klay, could it make it out of the play in. All three of their top guys showed a bit of decline. Steph looked straight up gassed in the play-in.</p>

<p>LAL - it is crazy how healthy and productive lebron and AD were. There is no way that is repeating itself. And that team struggled to make the playoffs.</p>

<p>LAC - how many games do you think you&rsquo;re getting from their top three players?</p>

<p>Phoenix - never mind the fact that they looked like a dumpster fire in the playoffs. That team has some massive issues. Not to mention KD just played the most games he has since his Achilles injury.</p>

<p>I think of two of these teams make it to the playoffs next year that would be pretty miraculous. I think it&rsquo;s almost as likely that all four of those teams drop below the line.</p>

<p>If the Clippers stay healthy they should be in there as well, but that is a massive if. Same for the Pelicans.</p>

<p>Suns probably have too much talent to miss the playoffs.</p>

<p>For the final spot I like the Kings the best.</p>

<p>So the teams I have missing out are the Lakers, Warriors, and Grizz. I don&rsquo;t think the Rockets, Jazz or Spurs are really in contention.</p>

<p>If all remains roughly the same? My 5 would be
GSW

<p>all 3 of these teams need to make some kind of move, Suns need a bench and a real PG not named Bradley Beal, Lakers need more reliable depth and Kings need to upgrade HB&rsquo;s position, potentially replace Monk if he walks and someone to help with non-Sabonis minutes.</p>

<p>Im gonna give the warriors a playoff spot, they have a lot of assets and ability to make changes and I think this will be the summer they do, not sure exactly what those changes will be but I can see something coming for them</p>

<p>Im a little worried about putting the rockets or lakers there because I think both are primed to make a star trade but that’s gonna be tough to project</p>

      <label for="l6xl0wi" class="commentText"><p>in no particular order:</p>

<p>-Clippers have real aging/injury concerns with few stretches of being fully healthy in their Kawhi/PG tenure. As the West gets better the Clippers <em>need</em> to be healthy to make the playoffs.</p>

<p>-Warriors have similar issues to the Clippers with maybe more glaring roster construction issues. some young guys might only get better and help carry them when guys miss time. Draymond and Klay have been regressing as time marches on. Steph goes down and it’s over for them.</p>

<p>-Lakers relied heavily on an aging Lebron and a healthy AD this year to squeak into the playoffs. Maybe some minor roster tweaks and a new coach will give the team an identity but even that seems like a <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> chance at best of happening. It’s not even guaranteed Lebron returns if he opts out of the player option (i fully believe he will). if AD or Lebron miss 20+ games i have a hard time believing they make the 8.</p>

<p>-Suns have so many issues their roster construction that it will be surprising if they don’t address any of it this offseason and make some tweaks. I’m confident they do get better to be honest. Even if Beal, Booker, and KD are trotting out there with a barely cut above a G League roster of misfits. if coach Bud can help their top-3 guys get out of their own ways to help the team they could become the force we thought they’d be.</p>

<p>-Kings i’m high on Keegan Murray and think he’ll only get better. His fit with Fox and Sabonis has been really great. The supporting cast of the Kings regressed a good bit this year outside of the top 2 guys so gotta see if everyone can step it up and maybe some roster tweaks will help them find the next step they need to take. However, roster tweaks can easily go awry. The Kings have a tough offseason and some decisions to make with a front office that is difficult to trust.</p>

<p>-Rockets I believe will make the playoffs unless they get ahead of themselves and rush to trade young guys for some star that doesnt ultimately move the needle for them. just let the team mature, invest in savvy vets, take your lumps and be patient. <em>if</em> they make the playoffs next year call it a successful season. don’t rush it. i’d be surprised if they’re not a play-in team at least.</p>

<p>-Jazz, it’s too early for them. Idk if there’s a move to pair Lauri with a running mate but i’m sure it’s out there and i’m sure Ainge is evaluating everything. but adding one other star or quality guy doesn’t solve everything for the Jazz who seem to have frontcourt issues and a very young backcourt. another team that ought to be patient whether they make a move or not (not at all against them trying to pry a star from a team but feel that isn’t enough right away)</p>

<p>-Pelicans are such a mixed bag of talent, health, logjams, youth, and veterans that it’s really tough to know what direction they’re heading but i fully expect them to shake it up somehow and not run it back. that said, no idea if that makes them better right away or if it’s a long term plan. CJ or not this a year to find direction which means discomfort in the short term.</p>

<p>-Grizzlies, ok Ja the pressure is on now. He’s had a year of being away from the metaphorical smoking gun of public ire with his off court issues. Can the Grizzlies stay healthy? Please? Can they address frontcourt depth and not rely heavily on Steven Adams please? Very chippy team who maybe casual fans forgot about but i’m sure most of us are looking at them and expecting a competitive team that ought to be in range of 50 wins <em>if healthy</em></p>

<p>Mavs, Twolves, Nuggets, and Thunder would all have to have wildly misfortune seasons to miss the playoffs next year — it happens but not going to predict it</p>

      <label for="l6xcqbt" class="commentText"><p>I think the relatively safe bets to make the playoffs, based on their current rosters and assuming no injuries, are the Nuggets, TWolves, Mavs, Thunder.  That’s 4.</p>

<p>I would be surprised if the Clippers didn’t make it, barring injuries, making 5.</p>

<p>You didn’t list them but I think the Spurs will make enough moves to get Wemby his all-star and playoff appearance next season.  I’ll make them my 6th.</p>

<p>Suns, Lakers, Warriors are all teams where it would not surprise me if they made a deep playoff run but also would not surprise me if they lost in the play-ins or missed the playoffs entirely.  I think at least 1 of them will make the playoffs though.  So that’s 7, maybe 8 slots.</p>

<p>If only one of the 3 above makes it, I’d say the Grizzlies, Pelicans, Kings, or Rockets will in decreasing order of likeliness for the 8th team to make it.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Jazz make it unless they make some sort of trade.</p>
