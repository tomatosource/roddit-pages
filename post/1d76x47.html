Prior to the draft, free agency, and trades, which 5 teams do you think will miss the playoffs? Mavs, T’wolves, Nuggets, Thunder,  Clippers, Suns Lakers, Pelicans, Kings, Warriors, Rockets, Jazz or Grizzlies?</p>
</a>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Next season in my opinion will be extremely interesting. I’m very curious to see if teams such as the Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings,and Golden State warriors make a comeback. I’m also expecting some of those younger teams like the Houston Rockets, and Utah Jazz to make a legit playoff push.</p>

<p>Pels, Kings, Warriors, Clippers, Suns and Jazz will miss next season. Rockets and Grizz are your play-in winners and the Spurs are a 1-6 seed (probably 6)</p>

      <label for="l6yz9tm" class="commentText"><p>The Spurs have never really made big free agency splashes and are pretty notoriously patient with player development. I do not think this is the season for them to make big moves that will improve their wins by 25+, it doesn’t make a lot of sense. Wemby is a generational defender right now, but he’s not a generational offensive player, which is what it would likely take for them to make a huge jump. The 2025 FA class has a lot more potential, and there’s no real reason to rush things for next season. No chance they make the top 6, and pretty unlikely they make the top 8.</p>

They also have two top 10 lottery picks this year, which is still huge for them despite the draft being widely considered “weak”. To your point, next year may make more sense for them</p>

<p>Wemby can be elite as he wants he’s not dragging that current roster to 49 wins. Which is basically what it takes to be a 6 seed in west.</p>

If Steph or LeBron or Luka or Jokić or SGA miss 6 weeks with an injury that could be the difference between contending for home court advantage in the first round and the play-in.</p>

<p>Jk we’re in a 1 team race for last. What an insane lineup of teams. You can expect a team or two to fall out due to injury, and I don’t think the Jazz will be in the race at the end, but that is 12 good teams for 8 spots</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot about the Spurs. Along with the Jazz I expect them to be somewhat competitive but fall out of the race</p>

<p>Why does our whole fanbase believe this despite all the stuff pointing towards the opposite?  She forked up for the Gleague team we&rsquo;ve needed for years.  The team just put in a new state of the art kitchen for the players. The people around the team say she&rsquo;s invested.  Why are you so certain she&rsquo;s not?</p>

You think a state of the art kitchen is a top priority for a team devoid of talent at every level.

      <label for="l6xh9fy" class="commentText"><p>The least injured. I think the ones you can probably bank on are the good, young deep teams like the Mavericks, Thunder, Wolves. I also think you can put the Nuggets here because they had the Murray injury and were still really great even losing depth too.</p>

<p>Teams reliant on older guys like the Clippers, Warriors, Lakers, Suns I&rsquo;d be wary about unless they find upgrades that can help carry the load.</p>

<p>Pelicans and Grizzlies are often injured but good enough to jump the 4 older teams imo if they stay healthy.</p>

<p>Kings and Rockets have a solid foundation but there&rsquo;s still something about them that has me hesitant to move them out of play-in caliber which is just down to 1 game.</p>

<p>I think just based on talent, Jazz and Blazers are going to miss it again, and the Spurs are dependent on how dominant Wemby is and if they get him some help.</p>

<p>11 and 12 will be whoever is dealing with the most injuries, like what happened to the Grizzlies this year.</p>

If he plays like he did against the Wolves against the Clippers, it&rsquo;d have been a clean sweep. And no, this isn&rsquo;t some &ldquo;He was guarded better&rdquo; thing. He was literally not running for the first 10ish games of the post season.</p>

      <label for="l6yc4lm" class="commentText"><p>I think we’re aiming for a Thunder arc; in 2021 they had SGA and went 22-50, 2022 they went 24-58, 2023 they went 40-42 for the play-in, and this year they had legit playoff aspirations from the jump. Not saying we’ll be 1 seed material in 3 years, just the progression of 2 years lotto -&amp;gt; one year playin -&amp;gt; playoffs seems to be attainable.</p>

<p>I think this year was our equivalent of their 2021, I’d expect us to be emulating their 2022 season next year, bigger moves next offseason to get us to play-in competitiveness, and full-blown playoff aspirations in three years with some real bigger moves if the right opportunity comes along to acquire a star.</p>

<p>That’d put us at playoff competitiveness at the end of Wemby’s rookie deal which seems reasonable (though hopefully some of our young guys pop off earlier than expected and we get there even faster)</p>

<p>We had the greatest franchise turnaround between seasons and that was with an entire new set of coaches, culture and direction mixed with a long list of injuries.</p>

<p>The guys are more acclimated to the new system. Tari, Amen will finally be healthy. We&rsquo;ll be adding Adams, which is a steroid injection into our rebounds and already stellar/budding defense. Al-P will be better conditioned to hoist the team on his shoulders. Cam will be getting PT from the jump. The biggest question mark will be Jalen, if he&rsquo;s still with us.</p>

<p>I truly believe the only thing that&rsquo;ll keep up out of the post season will be injuries</p>

What are they playing for with Markennan as their best player? that&rsquo;s not a future championship core that needs experience. they really need to just sell and properly tank imo. idk they keep hovering around the 11th-12th seed for. fuck it just bottom out. i know the odds are not that much better but why not? i love LM but he&rsquo;s not a superstar #1 option u build around.</p>

      <label for="l6ye4hc" class="commentText"><p>I think they wanted to fully tank the season right after trading Rudy and Donovan, but then Lauri and Kessler were way better than expected so they rode it out. This year they definitely should&rsquo;ve traded away guys sooner, though it seems like the draft is pretty rough anyways so it might not matter a whole lot. Will be interesting to see the plan this year&ndash;tanking makes the most sense for sure</p>

      <label for="l6xds6f" class="commentText"><p>The Lakers and Warriors are two teams with older players who are clearly on the decline. The Warriors just barely made the play-in this year so I think the chance of them making the playoffs isn’t that high. Although Lebron’s decline has been slow, it was pretty obvious last year and I would be that it continues next year. AD is great, but I don’t think I would bet on them to make the playoffs with how stacked the West is.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the following teams make the playoffs as constructed presently: Mavs, Thunder, Nuggets, T-Wolves, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Suns, Clippers.</p>

The only difference is he can&rsquo;t single handedly carry the team anymore. That being the case the Lakers making the playoffs is predicated on LeBron coming back and him and AD being healthy. They should focus on getting get rid of Dlo asap and get another decent starter.</p>

      <label for="l6ya97c" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, I bet on the Suns joining the Warriors and the Lakers if the Pelicans and the Grizzlies are even somewhat healthy. Booker ended up playing 68 games even though he missed some early games, and I honestly don&rsquo;t expect him to play many more even if he&rsquo;s healthy the whole season. KD played 75 games, which is not something I see replicated at 36, especially without a hit to his game to game production.</p>

<p>We had the worst coach in the league and missing half the roster to injury and still made 7 with great healthy seasons from Lebron and AD. So they can maybe move up 1 spot if everyone else was healthy as well.</p>

The proposition that MEM is a lock for top 5 seed under the hypothetical where <em>all teams</em> - not just MEM - are fully healthy just seems way too much to me given Ja&rsquo;s time off, loss of Steven Adams, etc.  Do I think they would be a top 5 seed under those circumstances?  Yeah probably, I think I would put them down as the 5 seed.  But is it a lock?  No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

But he’s honestly one of the 6 or 7 best players in the West, has had ton of time off and the team was just gifted a free season of development for guys that had already helped him get top seeds in the West when they were all young. The Grizzlies are in the same tier as OKC and Minny as young teams with young stars. Ja was doing what SGA and Ant are doing this year two or three seasons ago.</p>

      <label for="l6yavne" class="commentText"><p>The first 5 teams he named have either a ridiculously good player or enough depth that they should limp to the playoffs ala 2021 Nuggets/2020 Mavs or at least make the play-in even with zero plans to win like last year&rsquo;s OKC squad.</p>

<p>The only exception is if they literally have so many players injured that they can&rsquo;t fill their starting 5 up without signing 2-way and 10 day contracts like the Grizzlies this season.</p>

      <label for="l6z6wpj" class="commentText"><p>The term “lock” is so out of place here.</p>

<p>One could say based on present information, it seems like those are the top 5 teams by power ranking, but they are absolutely not locks for top 5 seeds (even using your health stipulation). Teams are ascending and descending more rapidly than ever before. Think about how dramatically the Timberwolves and Thunder exceeded preseason expectations. Hell even Dallas missed the playoffs last year. Zooming out, I believe I saw that only 2 total teams in the league who were in Vegas’s preseason top 10 advanced to the conference semifinals</p>

<p>I think rapid change is the new normal, especially in the west</p>

<p>If the Clippers stay healthy they should be in there as well, but that is a massive if. Same for the Pelicans.</p>

<p>Suns probably have too much talent to miss the playoffs.</p>

<p>For the final spot I like the Kings the best.</p>

<p>So the teams I have missing out are the Lakers, Warriors, and Grizz. I don&rsquo;t think the Rockets, Jazz or Spurs are really in contention.</p>

Blazers bottom. Jazz who knows what they’re doing they quietly tanked last two months of the year back to back and no one has said anything. Suns &amp; Clippers all down to health they have to be creative. Kings &amp; Pelicans will be 7-10 range I reckon.</p>

      <label for="l6xq6z8" class="commentText"><p>We may see a full changing of the guard. The old guys played the most games they&rsquo;ve played in years. And it didn&rsquo;t even get any of them past the first round.</p>

<p>GSW - healthy Steph and Klay, could it make it out of the play in. All three of their top guys showed a bit of decline. Steph looked straight up gassed in the play-in.</p>

<p>LAL - it is crazy how healthy and productive lebron and AD were. There is no way that is repeating itself. And that team struggled to make the playoffs.</p>

<p>LAC - how many games do you think you&rsquo;re getting from their top three players?</p>

<p>Phoenix - never mind the fact that they looked like a dumpster fire in the playoffs. That team has some massive issues. Not to mention KD just played the most games he has since his Achilles injury.</p>

<p>I think of two of these teams make it to the playoffs next year that would be pretty miraculous. I think it&rsquo;s almost as likely that all four of those teams drop below the line.</p>

      <label for="l6xl0wi" class="commentText"><p>in no particular order:</p>

<p>-Clippers have real aging/injury concerns with few stretches of being fully healthy in their Kawhi/PG tenure. As the West gets better the Clippers <em>need</em> to be healthy to make the playoffs.</p>

<p>-Warriors have similar issues to the Clippers with maybe more glaring roster construction issues. some young guys might only get better and help carry them when guys miss time. Draymond and Klay have been regressing as time marches on. Steph goes down and it’s over for them.</p>

<p>-Lakers relied heavily on an aging Lebron and a healthy AD this year to squeak into the playoffs. Maybe some minor roster tweaks and a new coach will give the team an identity but even that seems like a <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> chance at best of happening. It’s not even guaranteed Lebron returns if he opts out of the player option (i fully believe he will). if AD or Lebron miss 20+ games i have a hard time believing they make the 8.</p>

<p>-Suns have so many issues their roster construction that it will be surprising if they don’t address any of it this offseason and make some tweaks. I’m confident they do get better to be honest. Even if Beal, Booker, and KD are trotting out there with a barely cut above a G League roster of misfits. if coach Bud can help their top-3 guys get out of their own ways to help the team they could become the force we thought they’d be.</p>

<p>-Kings i’m high on Keegan Murray and think he’ll only get better. His fit with Fox and Sabonis has been really great. The supporting cast of the Kings regressed a good bit this year outside of the top 2 guys so gotta see if everyone can step it up and maybe some roster tweaks will help them find the next step they need to take. However, roster tweaks can easily go awry. The Kings have a tough offseason and some decisions to make with a front office that is difficult to trust.</p>

<p>-Rockets I believe will make the playoffs unless they get ahead of themselves and rush to trade young guys for some star that doesnt ultimately move the needle for them. just let the team mature, invest in savvy vets, take your lumps and be patient. <em>if</em> they make the playoffs next year call it a successful season. don’t rush it. i’d be surprised if they’re not a play-in team at least.</p>

<p>-Jazz, it’s too early for them. Idk if there’s a move to pair Lauri with a running mate but i’m sure it’s out there and i’m sure Ainge is evaluating everything. but adding one other star or quality guy doesn’t solve everything for the Jazz who seem to have frontcourt issues and a very young backcourt. another team that ought to be patient whether they make a move or not (not at all against them trying to pry a star from a team but feel that isn’t enough right away)</p>

<p>-Pelicans are such a mixed bag of talent, health, logjams, youth, and veterans that it’s really tough to know what direction they’re heading but i fully expect them to shake it up somehow and not run it back. that said, no idea if that makes them better right away or if it’s a long term plan. CJ or not this a year to find direction which means discomfort in the short term.</p>

<p>-Grizzlies, ok Ja the pressure is on now. He’s had a year of being away from the metaphorical smoking gun of public ire with his off court issues. Can the Grizzlies stay healthy? Please? Can they address frontcourt depth and not rely heavily on Steven Adams please? Very chippy team who maybe casual fans forgot about but i’m sure most of us are looking at them and expecting a competitive team that ought to be in range of 50 wins <em>if healthy</em></p>

<p>Mavs, Twolves, Nuggets, and Thunder would all have to have wildly misfortune seasons to miss the playoffs next year — it happens but not going to predict it</p>

      <label for="l6yc3ua" class="commentText"><p>I think PHX is imploding and if KD is traded they could miss the playoffs pretty easily with an injury to Booker or Beal (both injury prone). They would need some serious depth from a KD trade because they have no picks and one pick for the draft this year from a trade wouldnt fix the issues. This iteration of the Clippers also seems pretty dead. Rumors about PG getting traded are pretty prevalent but even if he stays having your two best players average 30+ missed games a year is a recipe for disaster. Harden also seems to lose focus/interest pretty easily. I think Pelicans definitely trade away some of their wings and then a Zion injury could knock them out (being a fringe team to begin with). The Lakers and Warriors are both pretty much irrelevant without some major moves. They might sneak into the playoffs if they stay healthy and other teams dont but they are first round exits. I dont think MEM is necessarily a shoe in but I have more faith in them than the other teams mentioned. Rockets should make it. I would say the Jazz have less of a chance than SA but neither make it imo. DAL, MIN, OKC and DEN should all be locks barring major injury. SAC dont excite me anymore and put them in a category with LAL and GS except they are more likely to stay healthy. I think SAC have an easier path to improvement tho if they make a move in the offseason.</p>

<p>Im gonna give the warriors a playoff spot, they have a lot of assets and ability to make changes and I think this will be the summer they do, not sure exactly what those changes will be but I can see something coming for them</p>

<p>Im a little worried about putting the rockets or lakers there because I think both are primed to make a star trade but that’s gonna be tough to project</p>

      <label for="l6xw5n5" class="commentText"><p>Whoever is the most healthy. If all are healthy, it&rsquo;s in 3 tiers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Solid: OKC, DEN, MIN, DAL, LAC</li>
<li>Scrape into 6ish seed: LAL, PHX, NOP</li>
<li>Play-in contender: SAC, GSW, MEM, HOU, UTA</li>
</ul>

<p>The top tier is obviously just a solid team that can contend for WCF again.</p>

<p>The scrapers have things going for them and against them (top talent vs. age/health).</p>

<p>The Play-in contenders are just not who they once were (GSW/MEM) or missing some talent/oomph. Even with major growth from a role player (a la Jalen Williams on OKC), I&rsquo;m hard-pressed to see much change next year. In terms of those leaps, maybe SAC with Keegan/Keon, HOU with Jabari/Amen, etc. It&rsquo;s just not enough for me to justify moving them up</p>

      <label for="l6ysx30" class="commentText"><p>Top 4 is debatable. I think Zion puts them in the top 5-ish but tbh a healthy CJ and Ingram can take you out of games just as much as win them, so I would say it&rsquo;s a net 0 for their health. I also think LAC still has the better &ldquo;Big 3&rdquo; in PG/Kawhi/Harden (because they&rsquo;re healthy too in this scenario). You can maybe argue Zion as the best player over Kawhi but the next 3 are easily PG/Kawhi/Harden vs. whoever you want to stack up in NOP</p>

      <label for="l6yutqt" class="commentText"><p>I disagree that a HEALTHY Ingram can take you out of games. We have only really seen him struggle when he is coming back from injury. Clips def have the better big 3, I wouldn&rsquo;t try to argue against that, but I think the supporting cast is better in NOLA than it is for the Clips. I suppose you&rsquo;re right all in all that it is debatable, and obviously I&rsquo;m higher on my own team that most, but I still will stand by it that if both teams are fully healthy, the pels are better than the clips.</p>

      <label for="l6y5669" class="commentText"><p>My four that I’m pretty sure will make it, provided no injured superstars or mass amounts of injured players, are the Mavs, TWolves, Thunder and Nuggets</p>

<p>After that it becomes a little dicey.  Pelicans, Clippers and Grizzlies probably make it if they can stay healthy, but these teams I can’t exactly trust to stay healthy unlike the four mentioned above</p>

<p>I expect a bounce back season from the kings, they are a good team that can stay relatively healthy</p>

<p>I don’t think Lebron/KD/Steph have that much left in the tank, and would expect a slight decline from these 3.  Also doesn’t help that the roster around these guys is straight up ass cheeks.  If I had to pick one of these teams to make the playoffs, I’d say the Suns, just because the sheer talent can get through the bottom half of the league even if they never develop chemistry</p>

<p>Rockets and Jazz I think are one-two years away still, though I could see the rockets making a breakthrough</p>

<p>Final Prediction: Mavs Nuggets TWolves Thunder Clippers Grizzlies Kings Suns (in no particular order)</p>

<p>And one of Lakers/Suns/Kings</p>

<p>all 3 of these teams need to make some kind of move, Suns need a bench and a real PG not named Bradley Beal, Lakers need more reliable depth and Kings need to upgrade HB&rsquo;s position, potentially replace Monk if he walks and someone to help with non-Sabonis minutes.</p>

  Rockets could make some noise they will make play ins at worst at best  5-6 seed if other teams are injured they at least have young depth
 Suns are competing at best 4-6worst 7-8 seed
 Pelicans could go anywhere 5-10 depending on zions health and what they get for ingram Lakers will push to make play in at least i put them 7-10 
Warriors will improve (dubs fan so call me biased) they had the most clutch games and donkey draymond missing a lot of games for suspensions hurt. Barring injury to curry or dray I put the warriors as 6 seed worst case 10 significant injury to curry or dray they could miss entirely
 Clippers 4-7 
Mavs top 5

<p>I would be surprised if the Clippers didn’t make it, barring injuries, making 5.</p>

<p>You didn’t list them but I think the Spurs will make enough moves to get Wemby his all-star and playoff appearance next season.  I’ll make them my 6th.</p>

<p>Suns, Lakers, Warriors are all teams where it would not surprise me if they made a deep playoff run but also would not surprise me if they lost in the play-ins or missed the playoffs entirely.  I think at least 1 of them will make the playoffs though.  So that’s 7, maybe 8 slots.</p>

<p>If only one of the 3 above makes it, I’d say the Grizzlies, Pelicans, Kings, or Rockets will in decreasing order of likeliness for the 8th team to make it.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Jazz make it unless they make some sort of trade.</p>

<p>The West playoffs is overrated af. It always is.</p>

<p>Superteam Suns got 4-0d</p>

<p>Lebron and AD got 4-1d</p>

<p>The idea of these series is always better than the actual result and had been some</p>

      <label for="l6xmtmw" class="commentText"><p>Murray and KCP were both injured.</p>

<p>Suns got steamrolled by the Wolves because the Wolves are really good. Suns would have been a top 4 seed in the East and would have been in the conference finals.</p>

<p>Lakers were a play in team that got beat by the defending champs. Lakers still would have been no worse than a 6 seed in the east</p>

<p>😂😂😂😂😂 East is JV and has been for a decade. The only thing that helped stave off the West&rsquo;s absolutely dominance was prime LeBron.</p>

<p>But at least East fans don’t pretend dogshit teams are good to feel better about their own team.</p>
