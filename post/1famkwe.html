You can clearly see in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adI4ALF8-dw" target="_blank">highlight reel of Game 3</a> where Dirk scored 39 that KG isn&rsquo;t anywhere near Dirk for most of his buckets. In fact, Nash and the Mavs are pretty much targeting the areas of the court where KG isn&rsquo;t. A few times here KG does get involved in the action and surprise surprise the Mavs don&rsquo;t score as easily.</p>

<p>KG put up 24.0-18.7(lol)-5.0-1.7-1.7</p>

<p>so you have a rebounding advantage, a clear defensive advantage, and a big assist and playmaking advantage</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This cuts to what I mean. You can say KG had the more <em>impressive</em> performance due to the difference in rosters. But you said he arguably had better numbers, which is a different argument. Dirk&rsquo;s numbers were more efficient, and he had a considerable advantage in ORTG and game score. So from a purely numbers perspective, I don&rsquo;t agree. From a performance level, that&rsquo;s much more debatable and mostly favors KG.</p>

<p>those stats are based on the team around them&hellip;. 5v5 not 1v1. More rebounds and assists while playing defense so much better that adjectives won&rsquo;t do it justice is arguable. We are doing it right meow</p>

<p>i get you are trying to split hairs here, but i meant statistically (the performance part is obvious), the context of the numbers is part of the numbers too</p>

      <label for="lluzh6q" class="commentText"><p>A performance can be better in context, but there is no &ldquo;better numbers in context&rdquo;. The numbers are what they are, so you either feel those numbers are better or you don&rsquo;t. Also, assists are accounted in some of the numbers that say Dirk had a better series, that&rsquo;s just how ridiculously efficient he was in the series. For reference, a guy averaging 30 on 74TS% with 4 assists on 1-2 TO would post better numbers than a guy averaging 26 on 51TS% with 7 assists and 4 TO. While yes, the 2nd guy is creating a lot, his numbers aren&rsquo;t necessarily <em>better</em> because he&rsquo;s giving up so much ground in efficiency.</p>

<p>putting up x numbers while not playing defense is not equal to putting up x numbers while playing incredible defense. Context absolutely is involved with looking at and comparing numbers (or else we would just speak math). What if player A was set up for every shot they took vs player B initiating the offense and handling the ball primarily, that also changes how you interpret the basic numbers</p>

      <label for="llv14wo" class="commentText"><p>If a lesser player goes <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on 3s, and score 30 points, that&rsquo;s better scoring numbers than a guy that goes <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> and score 23 points. Yes, the <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> might be a better player and may be in a worse situation (player A has more shots created for him) but his scoring numbers still aren&rsquo;t better, you&rsquo;re just more impressed by his performance given his role on the team. You&rsquo;re making more of an appeal to how tough Garnett&rsquo;s situation was and how he got the numbers, rather than establishing that the numbers themselves are better.</p>

      <label for="llv1kh0" class="commentText"><p>this is way too extreme and not related to what we are comparing.</p>

<p>I already demonstrated how the numbers are themselves arguable, the context where those numbers come from is another part of the argument, because these numbers exist from 3 basketball games that were played, and I watched</p>

<p>you can value efficiency and scoring without accounting for teammates and schemes and defensive pressures, and i can account for those differences and value the extra rebounding and assists (playmaking with context) and the less statistically relevant defensive side of the ball into those same offensive boxscore numbers, this is us arguing about which player put up better numbers</p>

      <label for="llv2a8i" class="commentText"><p>OK, but you&rsquo;re focusing less on what the numbers <em>are</em> (Garnett arguably having <em>better</em> numbers) and focusing more on how he got to those. Like someone could make an argument that Lebron in the 2015 playoffs had a more impressive performance, given the circumstances, than he did in the bubble playoffs. But it would be pretty hard to argue his numbers were better in the 2015 playoffs.</p>

<p>There is no denying that KG is a much better defender and much better rebounder. A better passer as well, while still dropping 24 PPG.</p>

<p>Garnet put up 24, 19 and 5 on 43% FG and 73% FT&rsquo;s, Dirk had 33, 16 and 0.7 on 53% from the field and 89% from the line and was 8-11 in the series from 3 on nearly identical FG &amp; FT attempts, whilst having just one less total block and 4 more steals with half the turnovers, there&rsquo;s no argument to be made there.</p>

I&rsquo;m not saying one out-performed the other but Dirk&rsquo;s job that series was shoot a target practice and he did it amazingly. KG&rsquo;s job was to be half the offensive while being like 80% of their defense. Dirk then had to go face an actual playoff team next round and shot 51%TS against the Kings. Does that mean Webber is a better defender than KG just because they play the same position?</p>

      <label for="llwt8vq" class="commentText"><p>Well Dirk did evidently outplay Garnet they took the same amount of shots with Dirk being vastly more efficient, obv not the only factor to Mavs winning that series but it&rsquo;s fair to say it was a pretty decisive one, especially G1 that was close until the end where KG shit the bed with 6-18 and 6 to&rsquo;s, Mavs were favourites and the better team but the comments in this thread makes it seem like it was Jordan against the 86 Celtics or something, KG had a point guard in Chauncey Billups who went on and became a hall of famer that won finals MVP making multiple all-nba and defensive teams, Wally Szczerbiak was also an all-star that same season, they averaged 22 and 20 pts each, both on better FG than KG. And no clue where you got the notion that i was insinuating that Dirk played better defense, was just listing of their respective statlines, as far as the Kings series yeah Nowitzki shot very bad and got outplayed, therefore Mavs lost handily, kinda like for KG and the Wolves no? Billups himself said he was confident going into the series about Garnet stiffling Dirk&rsquo;s offence.</p>

<p>better rebounding and assists are a thing, why do you folks need this repeated so much? Matchups and defensive assignments and schemes are a thing too, having Nash pass you the ball is like the number 1 way to have better offensive numbers and efficiency, we have more than a decade of tape and numbers to back that up</p>

<p>what happened to dirk&rsquo;s shooting and scoring next round against a not injured and not bad team?? weird right, like maybe basketball is a 5v5 game?</p>

When did MJ or KD get shut down by a matt barnes/stephen jackson/al harrington/haslem level player? He&rsquo;s pretty clearly in the next tier but as a shooter he&rsquo;s probably even more elite</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a good enough post game to get wings off of him in the playoffs until the last few years of his prime. His great athleticism was gone by then. The shooting is tippy top tier, so that part i get, but he only shot a few threes a game, much more of a midrange player than most people imagine</p>

<p>does dirk even have a scoring title?</p>

KG was never good enough at that to lead undermanned teams to upsets, which is super important in close playoff games that end up boiling down to just giving the ball to the best offensive player and relying on them to score for you</p>

<p>like, is it helpful to have? yeah. but plenty of teams have won championships without an elite iso scorer on the roster. that&rsquo;s what, uh, every other action in basketball is for</p>

The guy was an offensive monsters and definitely got stonewalled by MJ Bulls but Malone basically had a Chris Paul State Farm commercial in his pocket for his entire career. Giannis and Barkley are also questionable because they were amazing at what they did but ultimately, their lack of versatility means building the perfect team around them is harder and it took Giannis the best defensive star PG to actually get it done.</p>

<p>He was here from ages 18 through 30. Outside of a strike shortened season, he played over 75 games a season and averaged damn near 40 minutes a game. He had stiffs for teammates for a majority of it, and for like 5 years the team didn’t have a first round draft pick because of some dumbshit the front office pulled. </p>

<p>All I’m saying is don’t act like KG’s plight in Minnesota was even remotely similar to Dirk’s tenure in Dallas. </p>

<p>KG wouldve killed to play with the likes of Nash, Finley, Chandler, Marion, Terry, Howard, etc. through out his prime.</p>

<p>You know what he got? One season of old ass Sam Cassell and Chauncey Billups before he was Chauncey Billups (and of course Minny didn’t bother retaining him).</p>

<p>Duncan was probably better, but KG was definitely right there with him during pretty much the entire aughts.</p>

<p>Dirk was more of the 2nd half of the aughts like you said (he wasn’t first team NBA until 2005 and won his MVP in 2007). He was a couple of years younger than the other two and hit his stride a bit later.</p>

<p>Lmao at sour Tpups fans. You know you&rsquo;re on the interwebs right? Reddit? Where you discuss things? Y&rsquo;all fckin act like someone posts this everyday.</p>

<p>And lol @ the takes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;KG more complete, I&rsquo;d take him over Dirk&rdquo;
&ldquo;Id start a team with KG over Dirk&rdquo;</p>

<p>No you mother fckin wouldn&rsquo;t. KG as a 2nd or 3rd fiddle tho? Sure, y&rsquo;all got an argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dirk lucky he won a ring&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muthafckaz what did KG do before he got help?</p>

<p>Dirk clears KG in PF rankings and All time rankings. Dirk in top 20. Top 25 if you wanna be salty. Where KG? Lolol</p>
