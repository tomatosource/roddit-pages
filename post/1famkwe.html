You can clearly see in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adI4ALF8-dw" target="_blank">highlight reel of Game 3</a> where Dirk scored 39 that KG isn&rsquo;t anywhere near Dirk for most of his buckets. In fact, Nash and the Mavs are pretty much targeting the areas of the court where KG isn&rsquo;t. A few times here KG does get involved in the action and surprise surprise the Mavs don&rsquo;t score as easily.</p>

<p>this is the weirdest internet myth that has ever existed, nobody talked about this series like this back then. 3 games where Dirk gets hot covered by sam mitchell and chauncey billups isn&rsquo;t anything more than that&hellip;..</p>

<p>The mavs had Nash, Finley, and Van Exel destroying minnesota&rsquo;s perimeter defense every time down, Dirk was basically taking practice shots the whole 3 games lol, just watch it</p>

<p>would love for somebody to find more than 5-6 plays where they guard each other, based on TORCHED you would think it was the whole game&hellip;.</p>

<p>KG put up 24.0-18.7(lol)-5.0-1.7-1.7</p>

<p>so you have a rebounding advantage, a clear defensive advantage, and a big assist and playmaking advantage</p>

<p>Dirk has a scoring and efficiency advantage</p>

<p>then the roster differences should account as well, context</p>

<p>Seems arguable to me??</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This cuts to what I mean. You can say KG had the more <em>impressive</em> performance due to the difference in rosters. But you said he arguably had better numbers, which is a different argument. Dirk&rsquo;s numbers were more efficient, and he had a considerable advantage in ORTG and game score. So from a purely numbers perspective, I don&rsquo;t agree. From a performance level, that&rsquo;s much more debatable and mostly favors KG.</p>

<p>assists mean something</p>

<p>those stats are based on the team around them&hellip;. 5v5 not 1v1. More rebounds and assists while playing defense so much better that adjectives won&rsquo;t do it justice is arguable. We are doing it right meow</p>

<p>i get you are trying to split hairs here, but i meant statistically (the performance part is obvious), the context of the numbers is part of the numbers too</p>

      <label for="lluzh6q" class="commentText"><p>A performance can be better in context, but there is no &ldquo;better numbers in context&rdquo;. The numbers are what they are, so you either feel those numbers are better or you don&rsquo;t. Also, assists are accounted in some of the numbers that say Dirk had a better series, that&rsquo;s just how ridiculously efficient he was in the series. For reference, a guy averaging 30 on 74TS% with 4 assists on 1-2 TO would post better numbers than a guy averaging 26 on 51TS% with 7 assists and 4 TO. While yes, the 2nd guy is creating a lot, his numbers aren&rsquo;t necessarily <em>better</em> because he&rsquo;s giving up so much ground in efficiency.</p>

      <label for="llv04h4" class="commentText"><p>what?? every single number literally has context. Defensive coverages, matchups, coaching decisions with lineups</p>

<p>putting up x numbers while not playing defense is not equal to putting up x numbers while playing incredible defense. Context absolutely is involved with looking at and comparing numbers (or else we would just speak math). What if player A was set up for every shot they took vs player B initiating the offense and handling the ball primarily, that also changes how you interpret the basic numbers</p>

<p>the game is played on the court</p>

Yes, the <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> might be a better player and may be in a worse situation (player A has more shots created for him) but his scoring numbers still aren&rsquo;t better, you&rsquo;re just more impressed by his performance given his role on the team.

<p>I already demonstrated how the numbers are themselves arguable, the context where those numbers come from is another part of the argument, because these numbers exist from 3 basketball games that were played, and I watched</p>

<p>you can value efficiency and scoring without accounting for teammates and schemes and defensive pressures, and i can account for those differences and value the extra rebounding and assists (playmaking with context) and the less statistically relevant defensive side of the ball into those same offensive boxscore numbers, this is us arguing about which player put up better numbers</p>

Like someone could make an argument that Lebron in the 2015 playoffs had a more impressive performance, given the circumstances, than he did in the bubble playoffs. But it would be pretty hard to argue his numbers were better in the 2015 playoffs.</p>

      <label for="llv13mb" class="commentText"><p>I think people go way overboard with Dirk as a scorer. When did MJ or KD get shut down by a matt barnes/stephen jackson/al harrington/haslem level player? He&rsquo;s pretty clearly in the next tier but as a shooter he&rsquo;s probably even more elite</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a good enough post game to get wings off of him in the playoffs until the last few years of his prime. His great athleticism was gone by then. The shooting is tippy top tier, so that part i get, but he only shot a few threes a game, much more of a midrange player than most people imagine</p>

<p>does dirk even have a scoring title?</p>

      <label for="llux54b" class="commentText"><p>Are you going to argue that KG spending 14 (12 originally) seasons with the Wolves, 6 in Boston, 2 in Brooklyn with his only championship in Boston is as meaningful as Dirk spending all of his 21 seasons in Dallas, including Dallas&rsquo; only championship?</p>

<p>KG certainty was loyal to Minnesota during some bad years, but these two are not equal in that aspect.</p>

      <label for="lluyxn3" class="commentText"><p>You discredited him for leaving lol. </p>

<p>He was here from ages 18 through 30. Outside of a strike shortened season, he played over 75 games a season and averaged damn near 40 minutes a game. He had stiffs for teammates for a majority of it, and for like 5 years the team didn’t have a first round draft pick because of some dumbshit the front office pulled. </p>

<p>All I’m saying is don’t act like KG’s plight in Minnesota was even remotely similar to Dirk’s tenure in Dallas. </p>

<p>KG wouldve killed to play with the likes of Nash, Finley, Chandler, Marion, Terry, Howard, etc. through out his prime.</p>

<p>You know what he got? One season of old ass Sam Cassell and Chauncey Billups before he was Chauncey Billups (and of course Minny didn’t bother retaining him).</p>

<p>Imagine dirk on Minnesota with all that bullshit for 12 years, do you think he stays “loyal”? Do you think the 2nd/3rd best PF to EVER PLAY would maybe like to compete at the highest level?</p>

      <label for="lluw9fg" class="commentText"><p>The thing is though, that even if he didn&rsquo;t win a championship with them, KG is still a God to Wolves fans. As much as Dirk is to Mavs fans? Who knows, don&rsquo;t really know how you&rsquo;d be able to calculate that. But the Wolves are a historically terrible franchise and KG is like their one saving grace.</p>

Cassell was still a decent co-star (if a bit past his prime, despite making his first All-Star team that year), but the roster after that was horrendous</p>

<p>Dirk was a superior shooter, and he was on a better run team with superior teammates.</p>

<p>But when it comes to rebounding, athleticism, defense, ball-handling, passing, motor, etc… they know what the fucking score is lol.</p>
