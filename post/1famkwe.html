You can clearly see in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adI4ALF8-dw" target="_blank">highlight reel of Game 3</a> where Dirk scored 39 that KG isn&rsquo;t anywhere near Dirk for most of his buckets. In fact, Nash and the Mavs are pretty much targeting the areas of the court where KG isn&rsquo;t. A few times here KG does get involved in the action and surprise surprise the Mavs don&rsquo;t score as easily.</p>

<p>this is the weirdest internet myth that has ever existed, nobody talked about this series like this back then. 3 games where Dirk gets hot covered by sam mitchell and chauncey billups isn&rsquo;t anything more than that&hellip;..</p>

<p>The mavs had Nash, Finley, and Van Exel destroying minnesota&rsquo;s perimeter defense every time down, Dirk was basically taking practice shots the whole 3 games lol, just watch it</p>

<p>would love for somebody to find more than 5-6 plays where they guard each other, based on TORCHED you would think it was the whole game&hellip;.</p>

      <label for="lluwyud" class="commentText"><p>it is plenty arguable. assists mean something and there is a huge gap there. KG was seeing way more defensive attention than Dirk while KG was also anchoring a defense</p>

<p>KG put up 24.0-18.7(lol)-5.0-1.7-1.7</p>

<p>so you have a rebounding advantage, a clear defensive advantage, and a big assist and playmaking advantage</p>

<p>Dirk has a scoring and efficiency advantage</p>

<p>then the roster differences should account as well, context</p>

<p>Seems arguable to me??</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This cuts to what I mean. You can say KG had the more <em>impressive</em> performance due to the difference in rosters. But you said he arguably had better numbers, which is a different argument. Dirk&rsquo;s numbers were more efficient, and he had a considerable advantage in ORTG and game score. So from a purely numbers perspective, I don&rsquo;t agree. From a performance level, that&rsquo;s much more debatable and mostly favors KG.</p>

<p>assists mean something</p>

<p>those stats are based on the team around them&hellip;. 5v5 not 1v1. More rebounds and assists while playing defense so much better that adjectives won&rsquo;t do it justice is arguable. We are doing it right meow</p>

<p>i get you are trying to split hairs here, but i meant statistically (the performance part is obvious), the context of the numbers is part of the numbers too</p>

      <label for="lluzh6q" class="commentText"><p>A performance can be better in context, but there is no &ldquo;better numbers in context&rdquo;. The numbers are what they are, so you either feel those numbers are better or you don&rsquo;t. Also, assists are accounted in some of the numbers that say Dirk had a better series, that&rsquo;s just how ridiculously efficient he was in the series. For reference, a guy averaging 30 on 74TS% with 4 assists on 1-2 TO would post better numbers than a guy averaging 26 on 51TS% with 7 assists and 4 TO. While yes, the 2nd guy is creating a lot, his numbers aren&rsquo;t necessarily <em>better</em> because he&rsquo;s giving up so much ground in efficiency.</p>

<p>He was here from ages 18 through 30. Outside of a strike shortened season, he played over 75 games a season and averaged damn near 40 minutes a game. He had stiffs for teammates for a majority of it, and for like 5 years the team didn’t have a first round draft pick because of some dumbshit the front office pulled. </p>

<p>All I’m saying is don’t act like KG’s plight in Minnesota was even remotely similar to Dirk’s tenure in Dallas. </p>

<p>KG wouldve killed to play with the likes of Nash, Finley, Chandler, Marion, Terry, Howard, etc. through out his prime.</p>

<p>You know what he got? One season of old ass Sam Cassell and Chauncey Billups before he was Chauncey Billups (and of course Minny didn’t bother retaining him).</p>

      <label for="llufjnm" class="commentText"><p>Kevin Garnett actually said on his podcast that around this time, he was dealing with plantar fasciitis in both of his feet. It was so bad at certain points that he had to crawl out of bed in the mornings to the bathroom.</p>

<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s dealt with plantar fasciitis before knows how painful that shit can be.</p>

      <label for="llum5i7" class="commentText"><p>There is no way people are acting like KG never guarded Dirk in that matchup. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF_ehaEogEY" target="_blank">3 minute highlight of Dirk torching KG when guarded by him that series</a>.</p>

      <label for="llurx1v" class="commentText"><p>This 3 minute highlight reel has only a handful of plays where KG is the primary defender on Dirk in isolation. Hardly evidence of Dirk &ldquo;torching&rdquo; KG for an entire series. Hell, there&rsquo;s a couple clips here where KG isn&rsquo;t even anywhere near Dirk.</p>
