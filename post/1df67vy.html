      <label for="l8gw63f" class="commentText"><p>Funnily enough the guys that really underwhelmed on the Celtics and got traded at the deadline went to their new teams and played really well. Stevens played well for the Grizzlies, and Delano Banton looked like borderline young asset on the Trilblazers.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny to me how the Celtics team have really excelled on getting every ounce of talent out of their players, yet those guys broke out on lesser teams. Guess they just needed different responsibilities and a change of pace.</p>

      <label for="l8h55kv" class="commentText"><p>Yeah he wasn&rsquo;t as puzzling for me for a couple reasons. One, they hadn&rsquo;t really gotten to maximizing all their bench talent like they have now. That was the years they were really searching for anyone to be decent as a bench piece from Waters, to Edwards, to Langford, to Hernangomez, to a billion other guys.</p>

<p>And two, it was pretty obvious Nesmith had talent, but had needed more experience. He had flashes but they were hidden behind sloopy inexperienced sped up play. When he was traded I was almost certain he would bloom under a new team.</p>

      <label for="l8h7crg" class="commentText"><p>For Nesmith, it was a combination of him getting into his head too much on his shot, and not having consistent minutes because said shot wasn&rsquo;t falling. Everyone knew we needed a shooter for the team, so we drafted the best shooter in the draft. Nesmith himself said that he knows he was drafted to space the floor for the Jays, and then when he wasn&rsquo;t shooting well because we wanted him to be a spark plug, it became a cycle where he got more frantic trying to force shoots that he felt he had to make, and then us not playing him because he took wild shots.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s doing better in Indiana though, I will say I love the fact that he always hustled on defense, as he wanted to make a positive impact on the team in any way.</p>

      <label for="l8gzfch" class="commentText"><p>Nah man Banton had a 46% TS, he was lowkey terrible. I really rooted for him, but he was so frustrating. He was a guy who would make a great play, but then finish it with a terrible play. I don&rsquo;t know how many times he crossed someone over, and blew by someone just to miss a point blank layup.</p>

<p>And Lamar Stevens wasn&rsquo;t as bad as Banton, but I had really hoped he could carve open a role for certain matchups. He should&rsquo;ve been an option for some small ball 5, or defending some big 4s but Brissett took that job away from him and he was never really able to earn minutes. I really had some high hopes for him, but he never really was able to make an impact.</p>

He moves well laterally and has great anticipation. You could throw a highlight reel together of small quick guards trying to iso him and not being able to shake him. I’m not saying he’s Draymond but I’ve always felt he should be getting more minutes because of his switchability.</p>

      <label for="l8h2y0g" class="commentText"><p>Not too crazy. I was surprised Tillman didn’t get more early minutes in the series actually, but Tingus was playing so well. X tho is the perfect combination of stocky and quick to switch onto a player like Luka. He moves his feet better than Horford, and has a great second jump.</p>

      <label for="l8haq8w" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s crazy at all. Brad has shown a knack for buying low on guys who are better fits for the Cs than their current teams. Tillman was hampered by Morant and Smart both being injured and the Grizz not having great distributors. Similar deal with acquiring KP and Horford when he was in OKC (though they already knew Al). Tillman is also, like Jaden Springer, a diet version of Derrick White, a player that is good now but could be a real steal for the Cs if they can develop into a more reliable outside shooter.</p>
