</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In the NBA, we tend to list &ldquo;<a href="https://money.yahoo.com/nba-legend-allen-iverson-pens-211544308.html" target="_blank">scoring titles</a>&rdquo; &ndash; and all statistical leaders &ndash; on a <em>per game</em> basis. (Provided they meet a minimum threshold of games.) That stands in contrast to other sports. In the NFL, the year&rsquo;s leading rusher is the running back with the most yards over the course of the season (not per game). In baseball, the home run leader has the most over the course of the season (not per game).</p>

<p>There are pros and cons to each method. It feels like we&rsquo;ve been accustomed to &ldquo;per game&rdquo; in the NBA &ndash; and those numbers are easier to visualize and digest. At the same time, it may slightly contribute to load management. NBA stars know that their stats are not affected by missing a handful of games here or there.</p>

<p>But how would the scoring title change if we viewed it the other way? By TOTAL points over the regular season? Here&rsquo;s a look through the 2000s, with the changed scoring leaders in bold.</p>

      <label for="lrplyct" class="commentText"><p>Nah the minimums to qualify for stats has been in place for at least 20+ years, its just very low. You need to play in 58 games out of 82 to qualify, or if your total stat is high enough that you would still lead the league even if you did play the 58.</p>

<p>Common example is Gerald Wallace won the steal title in 2006 even though he only played 55 games because he had enough steals that his average was still higher than second place Brevin Knight, even adjusting for Wallace playing the 58 minimum.</p>

<p>The minimum 65 games for awards was only introduced last year which is likely what you are thinking of.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find the exact start date of the minimum game requirement but I assume its not too long sfter King won</p>

<p>KD had stated at the all star break that he didn&rsquo;t care about the scoring title, just wanted a chip, and then he heavily dropped his FGA .. I mean, dude averaged 6.4 assists in April — more than twice as many as he had averaged in the previous 2 seasons 😂</p>

<p>T-Mac himself was at 52.6% TS that year. KG was 54.7%.</p>

<p>Peja’s scoring that season was probably among as big an outlier as we’ve had.</p>

If you look across the league that year, tons of guys had their FG% drop a few percentage points. But even Shaq and Kobe didn&rsquo;t clear the 2k mark because they shared the ball with Malone and GP, and they both missed a lot of games that year.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still enough games to skip out on that load management can be applied, but it makes things tight enough that the competition is still there.</p>

      <label for="lrnlwz2" class="commentText"><p>perhaps on a seasonal basis but per game numbers are far better at reflecting player skill when talking about entire careers&hellip;.a number of players have more career points than Jordan but only a neurologically impaired person would try to argue any of them were better scorers. Same can be said for Rodman, routinely talked about as a top three rebounder of all time, perhaps even <em>the</em> greatest, but he sits at just #24 on the career rebounding list.<br>
So maybe the NBA has it backwards? Award the seasonal scoring champion on total points but award the all time career scoring champion on per game numbers? If ever there was an advertisement that it was the right thing to do then it would be MJ because he was clearly the greatest scorer we have ever seen. Calling LeBron the all time scoring champ just feels wrong.</p>

      <label for="lroefip" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s obvious. If you&rsquo;re playing less games, you&rsquo;re presumably getting more rest, and not running your body down as much. If you&rsquo;re fresher in the games you do play, you should score more points. If you have the total points score record, your ppg has to be near the top of the league regardless. Being able to sustain that, while playing more games than other players, is a feat of scoring ability.</p>

<p>I would prefer totals, but I do understand the argument for ppg. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s without merit, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s obvious either. It does want to make me argue for points per minute, to see who the real best scorer is.</p>

      <label for="lrmh10p" class="commentText"><p>Because per game stats just make more sense in most contexts.</p>

<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t use per game stats to judge a baseball player&rsquo;s home runs. Saying &ldquo;He hits .20 HRs per game&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t really that useful. It would be more useful to say &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hit 20 home runs in 100 games this season&rdquo; A player might hit a home run in 5 consecutive games, and then go multiple weeks without hitting one. The same is true (though over different time scales) for most baseball stats. The exception being pitching, where walks per game, ER per game, or strikeouts per game <em>is</em> useful because those things will happen in the vast majority of games. (It should be noted that even these stats aren&rsquo;t typically rated on a per game basis though, instead being counted per 9 innings. A player who strikes out 3 batters in 3 innings would have a strikeout rate of 9)</p>

<p>The same is true of hockey. Players score less than a goal per game, so it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to record that as a per game stat, but it might make sense to record saves per game for a goalie.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are examples in football as well but I don&rsquo;t really follow it that closely.</p>

<p>In basketball, however, it makes perfect sense to use per game stats for the majority of stats because almost all of the major stats happen multiple times in every game. a 20 PPG scorer almost always scores around that number of points in every game, so it gives you an idea of what to expect, it isn&rsquo;t very useful to say that someone has scored 800 points in 40 games this season, it&rsquo;s not intuitive.</p>

      <label for="lrn7fhv" class="commentText"><p>For football yards are often shown as per game (or per attempt) stats, and that&rsquo;s pretty much it individually.  TDs, sacks, interceptions, fumbles, etc are all shown as totals.  On the team level you might have penalties/penalty yards shown as per game stats as well, and maybe some trivial stuff like plays run or first downs.</p>

<p>Going back to basketball, I like per game stats more than totals, but I like per 48 minute (or 36 minutes or whatever) most.  Having stats as per game rewards players for sitting out the entire game as a rest day as opposed to playing at least a small amount of minutes.  2 players could play the same amount of minutes and score the same amount of points over the same number of team games, but have different per game stats because one player plays a couple extra minutes each game, but then takes a full game off.</p>

<p>You could also have some caveat to counting games for per game stats, where if a player misses exactly 1 team game it counts towards per game stats.  The idea is that load management days get counted against you, while missing games due to an actual injury wouldn&rsquo;t.  That&rsquo;s probably too complicated and would punish players for genuine small injuries that only need 1 game off.</p>

      <label for="lrnsps8" class="commentText"><p>Also applies to careers as well. Rodman is clearly a top three rebounder of all time, with some putting him at the very top, yet he is just #24 on the total career rebounds list.  If it wasn&rsquo;t for the anomaly that is Andre Drummond, Rodman would be sitting at the top of the per 100 rebound list for his career. His per 100 total rebounds per game for his career sits at 21.4, second to Drummond&rsquo;s 22.8.<br>
Now if you want to use Drummond to argue <em>against</em> per game numbers, he sits 1300 rebounds short of of Rodman&rsquo;s total career rebounds and just signed a multi year contract with Philly. He pulled down over 700 rebounds last year and while he won&rsquo;t do that in Philly with Embiid taking most of the minutes he should still get around 500 per season so he will likely overtake Rodman eventually, given he&rsquo;s still just 31 years old.<br>
The current total career rebounds leader is Wilt Chamberlain. That won&rsquo;t be broken, probably ever. But his estimated per 100 career rebound number is just 14.6 per game. Bill Russell&rsquo;s numbers would be very similar. So yeah, there is good justification for putting Rodman above the likes of Wilt &amp; Russell as rebounders when looking at per game numbers instead of totals.</p>

      <label for="lrlgx26" class="commentText"><p>From 89 to 94 - 5 of the 6 years the leaders in PPG, RPG, APG, SPG and BPG were the same as the totals on each category.  Only exception was 1991 in blocks were Robinson won total blocks with 320 in 82 games (3.90 bpg) and Olajuwon won BPG with 221 blocks in 56 games (3.95 bpg).</p>

<p>Since 1994 to today, only 4 years this has happened:</p>

<p>2009 - Wade, Howard, Paul, Paul, Howard</p>

<p>2010 - Durant, Howard, Nash, Rondo, Howard</p>

<p>2019 - Harden, Drummond, Westbrook, George, Turner</p>

<p>2024 - Luka, Sabonis, Haliburton, Fox*, Wemby</p>

<p>*SGA and Fox were tie with 150 steals but Fox played 1 less game than SGA so his average was higher.</p>

<p>Edit: Now I dont get why Olajuwon is the BPG leader in 1991.  Minimum games played for leaders is 58.  <sup>221</sup>&frasl;<sub>58</sub> is 3.81, which would put him below Robinson.  Anyone know when the 58g rule come into effect?</p>

<p>Edit2: Up to 1998, the requirement was to get to 100 blocks no matter how many games you played.</p>

Even then, we know that 2,000 rushing yards specifically is a meaningful marker just for legacy (that it is almost guaranteed to win you that year’s rushing title is far less meaningful). We know that 5,000 yards passing is a marker. They’re fairly arbitrary as numbers - we do love round numbers in every sport - but they are considered milestone measures.</p>

<p>The only context we ever get along those lines in the NBA is when people point out pace during Wilt’s time, so his 50 ppg isn’t considered equivalent to MJ’s 30 or whatnot.</p>

TS% took a long time to catch on before it was seen on broadcasts etc, we’re in that preliminary stage with the NFL especially with eras are being more robustly defined. Stats beyond the traditional ones are telling us a lot more but that takes a while to catch on.</p>

<p>Leading the league with 5,000 yards passing and 3,500 yards passing are wildly different and that’s becoming more pronounced and acknowledged over time, again especially because of how short the NFL season is. These differences are far more amplified there than in any other major sport.</p>

      <label for="lrmx0z6" class="commentText"><p>Baseball and hockey have scoring rates in the single digit percents of the scoring in basketball.  Home runs per game isn&rsquo;t brought up because no one would ever hit 1 and saying .85 hrpg doesn&rsquo;t have a great ring to it whearas 25 ppg sounds better than 1900 points because of how hard it is to conceptualize 1900 quickly</p>

      <label for="lro2zon" class="commentText"><p>In 2018 Harden was awarded the scoring title for averaging 30.4ppg in 72 games played. He totaled 2191 points that season.<br>
The next best scorer was AD with 28.1ppg and 2110 total points.<br>
Under the points total scenario though neither of these players would have been awarded the scoring title. It would have went to LeBron with 2251 points and a scoring average of 27.4ppg.<br>
You would be good with that?<br>
There would likely have been a public outcry.<br>
Harden though would have been on the other end of it a couple of years prior when he totaled 2376 points at 28.98ppg. He would have won the scoring title over Curry by a solitary point when Steph totaled 2375 points but did it at 30.06ppg.<br>
Harden wins it by a single point despite averaging more than that <em>below</em> Curry&rsquo;s average. Now <em>that</em> would have been absurd.<br>
2015 we have a scenario that could be used in favour of the points total argument with, again, Harden being involved. He totaled 2217 points that season in 81 games at 27.37ppg. He lost the scoring title to Westbrook who totaled 1886 points in 67 games at 28.15ppg. He averaged just 0.78 more points per game but had 331 less points in total.<br>
There are other examples for and against either scenario but perhaps the most egregious example against the points total came in 2002. That season AI won the scoring title after averaging 31.38ppg with 1883 total points. He played just 60 games, 2 games more than the minimum requirement back then. But he would have lost the scoring title to Paul Pierce who averaged just 26.15ppg. That&rsquo;s 5.23 points per game LESS. PP totaled 2144 points in 82 games that season.<br>
In fact looking through all of NBA history produces more anomalies that would highlight the absurdity of having the total points winner be awarded the scoring title than it does the other way round. History supports the PPG leader being the scoring champ.</p>

He sprains his ankle game 75 sits out the last 6 games so he doesn&rsquo;t hurt it worse for the playoffs. Then Lamelo Ball plays all 82 games and beats steph by 1 point despite averaging a half point less a game. Who is the better scorer? Almost everyone in the NBA misses some games. It shouldn&rsquo;t be a contest of who played 74 or 76 games. Then it&rsquo;s just a durability contest. I think 65 game minimum and going by average makes perfect sense.</p>

<li>For this example to work their PPG have to be close. Taking around 30 PPG to win 0.5 PPG is 1.6% of difference. Using just from presented data: season <sup>2012</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>: in PG difference between Carmelo and KD was 2.1%. It decided, that playing 18% less game Carmelo won title. Meanwhile in scored points it was over 18% more scored by KD.<br>

<li><p>Availability is most important ability. For anything. Because no matter how good is player, if he is unavailable, he doesn&rsquo;t score, assist, block&hellip; He is worthless as scorer, assistent, blocker&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p>Rewarding per game creates negative incentive: rather than reducing minutes for load managment, and putting stars when they are needed it forces for resting them for whole game, rendering them useless even if they might be usefull.</p></li>

<li><p>PPG literally rewards cowardice: player who plays 82 games plays against best defenses in league. Meanwhile to get scoring champion easiest way is literally rest in this particular games.

<li><p>Fair example of the total points guy getting hosed. Did you look at 2016 where James Harden scored 1.1 fewer points per game but scored 1 more total point because he played 3 more games.</p></li>

<li><p>Availability is the best ability. That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t see a lot of guys on very good teams playing all 82 games because the best teams want their players available for games that matter. A 22 year old on a 22-60 team playing 82 games happens more than a 30 year old on a great team. Also players chase accolades naturally. It&rsquo;s much safer and better for the league if guys are sitting out games if they&rsquo;re banged up rather than worrying about playing every game because they&rsquo;re in line for the scoring title.</p></li>

<li><p>If someone wants to do that weak shit let them. For the most part great players who are load managing or whatever you want to call it sit against the bad teams and play against the best teams.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>82 games is way too many. If you average a full point more a game you should not be punished for missing 3 games. Total points rewards the most available player not the best scorer. The first time someone on a contender got hurt game 81 because they were playing through an injury to get the scoring title you&rsquo;d realize how truly silly of an idea this is.</p>

<p>And &ldquo;elites don&rsquo;t avoid&hellip;&rdquo; argument: after his traditional injury break in 2021-2 season Embiid missed 4 regular season games: 2 times against Memphis (6th defense rating), 1 against Heat (4th rating) and last game of the season (which tbf. was against Detroit so probably even could increase his PPG). So 3 out of 4 would almost certainly had negative impact on his productivity in PG status.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not a question the scoring title was created to answer. It&rsquo;s purely a reward for the highest scoring player. The argument is: does &ldquo;highest score&rdquo; mean most total points, or highest average per game. That&rsquo;s it. &ldquo;Best&rdquo; has nothing to do with it.</p>

      <label for="lrmuard" class="commentText"><p>Lol &ldquo;best&rdquo; is the whole argument. We are arguing about which of these ways is the best way to figure the scoring title. A reasonable person would assume that title would be ideally given to the best scorer for that season. I think (as does the NBA) the best way to figure that out is to use ppg. The batting title goes to the player with the highest batting average because they thought that was the best way to figure out who was the best batter that season. They don&rsquo;t use total hits.</p>

      <label for="lrm45eh" class="commentText"><p>Why does it make more sense?</p>

<p>Total points scored is the most important stat in the NBA. It&rsquo;s the stat that determines wins and losses. You don&rsquo;t win a game just because you have a better FG% than the other team. The team with more points scored always wins the game, though.</p>

<li><p>lots of points means you’d be dealing with giant point totals and still pretty big totals for other stats. someone else brought up how no one uses “home runs per game”, but those would be &amp;lt;1 for everyone. with basketball, you’re getting 25+ ppg for almost every leader, double digit rebounds and around 10 assists for their respective leaders, and even 2+ steals or blocks.</p></li>

<li><p>it serves to give you an idea of how much they’re doing in a given game as opposed to what they’ve done across the season. 2000 points could be 25 ppg for 80 games, or it could be almost 31 for 65 games. by totals, you just know these guys both scored 2000 points this season, but per game you know the second player was scoring a lot more, just less healthy</p></li>

And they didn’t retroactively change them once they switched. So if you look up a an all time list of scoring title winners, it goes by totals through 1969, and averages after that</p>

<p>Edit: I think 1968 and 1948 are the only years this impacts, at least for scoring. Zaslofsky had the most points in 48, but Fulks had the highest ppg.</p>

      <label for="lrmykq4" class="commentText"><p>It’s incredibly stupid the NBA rewards per game averages instead of total output. Especially while they’re trying to crack down on load management.</p>

<p>Imagine the home run leader in MLB being measured by HR per game.</p>

      <label for="lrnbrg3" class="commentText"><p>In the last 20 years yes if you don&rsquo;t count Curry. It&rsquo;s not greater than Jordan&rsquo;s 37.1ppg in 82 games straight just on the points, but they are different era&rsquo;s. Harden and Jordan are relatively close on 2 point %. Jordan is better at his peak with slightly less ppg.</p>

<p>But Steph&rsquo;s 30.1ppg year with 63% eFG is basically insane. Overall, it&rsquo;s hard to argue anybody was more efficient than him. He only averaged 5 fucking free throw attempts a game and shot three&rsquo;s at a 45% rate. That isn&rsquo;t going to be beaten by anybody for a long ass time IMHO. At least in how impressive it is from a shooting angle. Out of these players just by athletic prowess and sheer dominance Jordan is unmatched. He flew around the league like a fucking comic book hero and was absolutely nuts in his prime. Most people just can&rsquo;t understand how fast and agile he was in his prime years. 90-91 was basically his best and most mature year as a player. But in the late 80s he was probably even more athletic. Harden did this a bit more, but Curry obviously doesn&rsquo;t really have that in his game. He&rsquo;s just sheer numbers by 3s.</p>

<p>Jordan got a lot better at shooting the next season after 37.1 and averaged 35 a game. His eFG wasn&rsquo;t quite as good as Harden&rsquo;s until MJ&rsquo;s peak a few years later where he surpasses him, but altogether it&rsquo;s inconclusive because the era&rsquo;s were so different. Jordan saw the free throw line more than any time in his career, and he was also hacked up pretty damn good esp by the good teams like the Pistons. Harden never saw any of that kind of physical defense or very rarely, and also spent a lot of time at the line.</p>

<p>We also have to take into account the flopping style of play here as it was kinda weird and Harden obviously took advantage of it, but you get the point they each played a very different game in different era&rsquo;s with numbers that were fairly even in their best seasons. I would say just on understanding both styles of games, Jordan just looked way cooler doing what he was doing in that era. No question. Harden probably too often looked like an uber-efficient bum trying to draw fouls on flops a lot of the time. But he was damn good at it with slightly less eFG% than Jordan&rsquo;s 33ppg year but better than his 37ppg year.</p>

<p>Both players zipped the league shut though multiple seasons.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rank Curry highest just by sheer efficiency, Jordan the most dominant offensive force by weight of pure output and overall ability, e.g., steals, speed, dunks, drawing fouls, et cetera, and then Harden as kind of a combo of them with flops on the side.</p>

There’s a big difference between a person who plays 65 games and a person who played 80 games even if he score a little bit less per game. The one who played more games is generally more worthy.</p>
