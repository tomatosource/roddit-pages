      <label for="lmv4aub" class="commentText"><p>I think that&rsquo;s pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>The most league-ready NBA rookie (Sheppard) is on a team with some other guards who will get a lot of minutes.</p>

<p>Edey is the Grizzlies <em>only</em> center and it&rsquo;s a team that could find themselves on the top of the West bracket, so in that case he&rsquo;d be a pretty high profile rookie.</p>

<p>My real question is why Dillingham isn&rsquo;t even mentioned. I can&rsquo;t imagine putting him any lower than 3rd most likely to win the award.</p>

      <label for="lmv702e" class="commentText"><p>I think there&rsquo;s more shots for him than that, given that Milton averaged 4.2 FGA, Morris averaged 4.4, and Anderson averaged 5.5. If Ingles is healthy, he&rsquo;ll take some of that, but it wouldn&rsquo;t shock me terribly if Dillingham is 3rd or 4th on the team in average attempts next year. In the end, Naz Reid won 6th man last year on only 10 attempts off the bench.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately that if Dillingham performs, he&rsquo;s gonna get more credit for doing it for a winning teams playing games that matter, same as Edey.</p>

<p>We have a lot of depth at the 4 (Aldama, LaRavia, GG), so we can slide JJJ over if we have to. We also have a new 2 way guy (Josh Huff) who can apparently hold it down in a pinch.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre probably going to do a lot of experimenting early in the season to figure it out.</p>

      <label for="lmvqrg4" class="commentText"><p>very curious to see where the lineups land for y&rsquo;all.</p>

<p>Ja/Bane/Smart/Vince is such a strong rotation if that was just covering guard play, but it feels like Smart &amp; Bane are going to be asked to flex up into wings (Bane more on offense, Smart on defense), at least until GG comes back.</p>

<p>Lots of guards, not a ton of wings, lots of power forwards, not a lot of centers is an interesting puzzle to figure out.</p>

      <label for="lmvg546" class="commentText"><p>IMO JJJ isnt as effective at the 5. He cant rebound but he is a great paint protector. He is a decent scorer with like a 20 ppg. We really need a rebounder and high screen setter. BC does really well off the bench but hes not tall enough to go against most of the 5s in the league.</p>

      <label for="lmvnxpp" class="commentText"><p>Because he isn&rsquo;t starting or gonna have a huge role?  He&rsquo;s tiny too?  When is the last time a ROY came off the bench?  I truly don&rsquo;t remember one.  Probably Brogdon, but he still started like <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the season and is widely considered the worst ROY in recent memory, and that was also like 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I would be shocked in Dillingham wins, and I think putting him 3rd would be insane.  He&rsquo;s not THAT good, he has some clear weaknesses in terms of NBA size that will take some time to adjust to, and won&rsquo;t get a ton of minutes right off the bat.</p>

<p>It honestly makes no sense to me that anyone is confused by Dillingham&rsquo;s absence, unless they are way overrating his current ability.  Like I said, he&rsquo;s very small, he isn&rsquo;t THAT good yet, and isn&rsquo;t going to start.  He&rsquo;s like a Bones Hyland type of rookie to me, which is good for a 1st or 2nd team spot if he plays well but he simply won&rsquo;t get the minutes and counting stats to win ROY.</p>

      <label for="lmvqa9m" class="commentText"><p>Honest question, which rookies are locks to start this year?</p>

<p>Riscaher <em>maybe</em>?</p>

<p>Sarr, yes.</p>

<p>Sheppard, no (even though he should).</p>

<p>Castle, yes.</p>

<p>Holland, no.</p>

<p>Salaun, no.</p>

<p>Clingan, no.</p>

<p>Edey, clearly yes.</p>

<p>After that, I can&rsquo;t really find a clear guy, but maybe I&rsquo;m missing someone. Maybe Knecht?</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s 3 starters and 2 maybe starters in the top 10. I don&rsquo;t think Sarr will be efficient as a rookie, Castle will probably be more of a utility off-guard for a lot of his minutes to start. At least Dillingham will have clear role and need on a team with a real offensive structure and ecosystem around him.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m more high on him than I should be, but if you&rsquo;re telling me that the Wolves are going roll out a line up of Dillingham/NAW/McDaniels/Ingles/Naz against 2nd unit opponents, I think Rob is going to put up a <em>ton</em> of shots.</p>

      <label for="lmv67qw" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely fair.</p>

<p>No-one in this class is really getting to like 20ppg as a primary scorer this year (possibly even ever), and the guys on the tanking teams who would usually get  lot of minutes, are either not gonna be good enough offensively and/or competing with too many other young guys who also need development. (Possible caveats to this might be Bub or Clingan if their teams can somehow trade Poole/Ayton).</p>

<p>That means that it&rsquo;s very likely gonna be a Brogden-type year, but with no Embiid in the shadows. Someone who plays a positive role on a good basketball is probably gonna be enough.</p>

<p>If Edey averages like <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in 25mpg? That is probably enough.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, the likely alterntives would be if Sheppard commands that 3rd gaurd spot early and goes like 15ppg on great shooting? If Knecht is the Lakers 4th best player, goes like 12/4/4? Probably a bunch of guys who could put up similar type of numbers if given the opportunities (and as a Spurs fan I&rsquo;ll include Castle)- but I wouldn&rsquo;t really bet on anyone going for much more than this to seperate themselves obviously.</p>

<p>But, as long as Chris Paul is healthy, on the team and not being rested, Castle is only getting garbage time minutes at the point. So instead his year (at least until the trade deadline) will mimic UConn last year - basically his focus is to be a defensive gaurd who is an off ball cutter on offense. I think he will actually do well in that role (as long s the defence holds up) and it helps his long term development (if a future PG, it&rsquo;s almost certainly gonna be in the Jrue Holiday type of role, not as a full time primary playmaker/scorer)&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t think that role I gonn be conducive to numbers (and thus the ROY race) and I expect a lot of criticism from other fans even if he&rsquo;s actually doing lots of winning stuff on the court.</p>

      <label for="lmvmqq2" class="commentText"><p>That story about him missing numerous shots in practice is quite concerning. He has much room to improve but couple that with the questions about his mentality, it does make people more hesitant about his potential.</p>

<p>But he can be a really great player if he grinds and improves throughout his year. The concerns are why he fell in the draft but as a rookie he has a long runway to improve. Just may not be enough for him to get ROY or 1st team.</p>

<p>Although worst rookie bust may turn out be Sarr. Unless his horrendous play in summer league was a complete aberration, he is set up for a tough year. It&rsquo;s difficult to read too much into Summer League play but his performance was on a generational level of garbage.</p>

      <label for="lmv4mty" class="commentText"><p>Makes sense, He is coming into a pretty easy lock for a starting position, on a team that *Should* be a second round playoff contender in the west, Ja and marcus smart are both great at setting up their big men, so he will have the oppurtunity, being on a winning team, the &ldquo;story&rdquo; of the grizz bounce back year.</p>

      <label for="lmvfw52" class="commentText"><p>Brogdon was at least an NBA-ready player and outside 6MOY candidate who contributed a lot more than his statline. If it&rsquo;s a bad statline that wins it this year it might be from an older dude who brings a lot on defense and has great intangibles</p>

      <label for="lmvfi3u" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m sure he can be a similar to a bunch of other guys in that 10-12ppg range, but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on the Bulls being good enough for him to get heaps of ROY attention if guys like Edey and Shepherd do a bit better on better teams.</p>

<p>And assuming that you guys want to prioritise getting the ball in Giddey&rsquo;s hands (I mean why else trade for him), as well as continue to develop White, and probably try to rehab Lavine&rsquo;s trade value as well - it&rsquo;s not like there is a bunch of opportunity there for Buzelis to play on the ball.</p>
