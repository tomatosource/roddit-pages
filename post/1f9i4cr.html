<p>In the Lakers they were never the same level, Shaq just couldnt be bothered about regular season and Kobe was a maniac about the game <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. And yet Shaq were the better player.</p>

<p>By 2005 until the end, it was consensus that Kobe was better (ironic how Shaq was second at MVP voting that season), but before that it was all about Shaq.</p>

      <label for="llmigl9" class="commentText"><p>Always easy to spot those who never got to watch Shaq whenever they just dismiss his success as carried by his size lol</p>

<p>Shaq had like 70% of the fluidity of Joker, 70-80% speed of Giannis, decent handles and playmaking for a big around Embiid&rsquo;s level, great post moves and <em>feetwerk</em> and he was significantly stronger than any of Joker Embiid Giannis. And his defense for the type of ball in his era was good. Don&rsquo;t expect him to guard the pnr but he was great at holding down the paint.</p>

<p>He was a worse shooter and terrible FT shooter than any of them tho but that didn&rsquo;t matter much back then, bad FT shooting just held him back from could&rsquo;ve been GOAT-tier down to Top 10 and arguably most dominant in his peak even over the likes of MJ and Bron</p>

<p>Watching Prime Shaq was the perfect example of the formula Force = mass*acceleration. And he had hell of a lot of both mass and acceleration.</p>

      <label for="llnj19a" class="commentText"><p>2004-2005 was a &lsquo;bad&rsquo; year for Kobe as well. It was the first year without Shaq on the team; the Lakers sucked, and he hadn&rsquo;t grown to fill the void yet.</p>

<p>A lot of the awards were vibes, though. Shaq had just gone from the Lakers to the Heat, which elevated the Heat from mediocrity to the top of the division. While in retrospect, an ascendant Dwyane Wade had a lot to do with it, at the time Shaq got most of the credit.</p>

<p>That made Kobe having a meh year (by his standards) on a bad team shortly after the Colorado allegations look even worse. The Kobe vs TMac debate wasn&rsquo;t looking good for Kobe.</p>

<p>05-06, though, Shaq got hurt and Kobe ascended. The Heat won the championship that year, but the narrative had shifted.</p>

<p>If I had to pick a point where the two were equal, it would be the one game of the 05-06 season before Shaq&rsquo;s ankle injury. Surprisingly, I don&rsquo;t think it was all that close before or after that.</p>

      <label for="llow96i" class="commentText"><p>While some people do exaggerate Kobe fully carrying Shaq in multiple playoff series, I think it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that Shaq had already played 3 seasons (or 2.5 seasons if you are docking off time from the lockout season) with the Lakers before they finally won their first ring. Shaq never played bad, but it was obvious that the Lakers were missing a star player despite how dominant he was overall. It wasn&rsquo;t until Phil Jackson came onto the team and Kobe finally blossoming into a star (or even superstar) player that they finally won. The Finals may have been the Shaq show, but in the western conference playoffs they were truly a duo that was hell to deal with.</p>

<p>There are many moments where Kobe&rsquo;s heroics did save the Lakers from losing an advantage in a series, losing the series overall, or just having the better matchup that other teams couldn&rsquo;t handle (see Kings, Spurs, and Portland at the time). I think it&rsquo;s worth remembering those moments as those were the games that gave Kobe a lot of positive reputation as a basketball player in his early years. He became arguably, if not most definitely the best two way guard in the league and was the reason why he people really started comparing him to MJ to begin with.</p>

<p>Shaq simply played better&hellip;because he was better. They both upped their usage when the other was out, but Kobe did 30ppg/5apg on ~52-53 TS% and Shaq was doing 30ppg/4apg on 60 TS%.</p>

<p>But definite answer? After 2002.</p>

<p>People forget 2003 and 2004 exist.</p>

<p>Shaq played only 67 games in 2003 and was 5th in MVP voting. Kobe averaged 30/7/6 and was 3rd in MVP voting.</p>

<p>That was the first of the &ldquo;heal on company time&rdquo; years of Shaq and Kobe was a damn phenom putting up 28/5/5 with all NBA defense.</p>

<p>In a way, Kobe was right. Shaq was dominant as fuck but couldn&rsquo;t be bothered keeping professional 100% of the time. The 00 Lakers was the only time they won 62+ games, that should&rsquo;ve been the first of 2-4 years.</p>

<p>If Shaq kept himself in shape 2-4 years would have been just 50% of what they could have done together. I think Shaq was also ok with Kobe taking more responsabilities but they were still alfdogs&hellip;</p>

<p>Despite everything Shaq remained a great player basically till 2008 or 2009. Just maybe the Lakers could have won easily 6 or 7 chips.</p>
