</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Of course trade deadline and in season trades will be a part of this convo as season goes along. (Remember last season, Mavs GM Nico was praised for trading for PJ and Gafford)</p>

<p>But since, we only have the draft and the off season free agency signings, off season trades in our pockets.</p>

<p>Who is the best GM so far in terms of off season moves?</p>

<p>Imo, it is Sam Presti of OKC.</p>

<p>Trading Giddey for Caruso. And getting Hartenstein is lowkey genius to even strengthen the core of SGA/Jdub/Chet.</p>

<p>How about you?</p>

<p>Kerr was handed a blank checkbook with some of the best players to ever play the game and seemed to have a coaching method of, &ldquo;let my best players play&rdquo; which takes little to no basketball knowledge to implement. It&rsquo;s how he coached the Olympics. Forget adjustments, I&rsquo;m just gonna make some subs and take a seat.¬†</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m comparing their situations.  Kerr and Stevens both inherited ideal situations and maximized them, which is admirable, but it&rsquo;d be a guess to assume Stevens could right the ship at, say, Washington just because he&rsquo;s found success in Boston</p>

      <label for="llbs1g0" class="commentText"><p>OKC got exactly what they needed. Caruso is simply a better fit than Giddey and Hartenstein is going to help them with rebounding. Can‚Äôt really get much better than that unless they swung a huge trade with all their draft capital.</p>

<p>Boston might not get as much credit for it, but securing pretty much their entire team to long term deals means they don‚Äôt have to worry about shedding talent after winning a championship (like Bruce Brown left Denver for more money, or PJ Tucker left Milwaukee). It‚Äôs a good problem to have where they‚Äôve essentially locked up the best starting 5 in basketball for 2+ more years, improved their bench (a full year of Tillman, potentially Lonnie Walker) and still have plenty of young guys waiting in the wings (Springer, Queta, Scheierman, Walsh) that they can hopefully develop to keep this ball rolling through the Jay‚Äôs primes even if they need to shift off of guys getting older (Horford, Jrue)</p>

<p>Both Sam Presti and Brad Stevens have been excellent GM‚Äôs in the short and the long term</p>

<p>Trading Bridges for probably twice his value has a purely on the court player. Getting back draft capital in the best drafts in the future. And just picking a direction instead of other franchises in similar spots and sticking with mediocrity.</p>

      <label for="llbsvu1" class="commentText"><p>Morey got the biggest fish, some solid role players, and gave up no assets.</p>

<p>Presti separated the Thunder in the West imo, without giving up any assets.</p>

<p>Horst probably got the most out of what he had to work with.</p>

<p>Stevens kept the band together and got White on super valuable extension. Also, Walker on an Exhibit 10 deal, what?</p>

<p>I like how Dunleavey pivoted after Klay left, I actually think the team is better now.</p>

<p>Rosas should be mentioned for the Brunson deal alone.</p>

<p>And for not trading for Lauri Markannen or any other All-Star on the market. The Spurs aren&rsquo;t an All-Star starter away from competing for a championship. The Team still needs another year of development. Vassell and Sochan look amazing, but they still need improvement on consistency.</p>

<p>I personally think he&rsquo;s done fine, above average for sure, especially considering historical performance, but not in the conversation for best GM.</p>

<p>So pick between sam presti or Daryl morey.</p>

<p>Okc‚Äôs roster is unbelievably deep and at the same time they have star power. Okc imo should be the favorite to come out the west.</p>

<p>In Philly, getting Caleb Martin for so cheap was such a steal given his playoff performances. He‚Äôs gonna get a lot of open looks in Philly. And then Paul George is still a good wing.</p>

<p>Wild card is the Knicks. It‚Äôs hard to praise the Knicks because they gave up so much for mikal bridges. Mikal himself idk if he is worth so much. But when u consider mikal is gonna take a paycut, and he potentially puts the Knicks up there as real contenders it‚Äôs probably a good trade by the Knicks. Also don‚Äôt think a lot of gms would‚Äôve had the balls to do it so that is praise worthy.</p>

      <label for="llbz9i7" class="commentText"><p>Rafael Stone drafting Reed Sheppard could be considered one of the standout moves of the offseason for several compelling reasons, though it&rsquo;s important to remember that evaluating such moves often depends on how the player develops and contributes over time. Here‚Äôs why Sheppard‚Äôs selection could be viewed as a significant and savvy move:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>High Upside and Potential</strong>: Reed Sheppard has demonstrated impressive skills and potential during his college career. Known for his scoring ability, playmaking, and basketball IQ, he brings a lot of promise to the table. If he realizes his potential, he could become a cornerstone of the Rockets&rsquo; future.</li>
<li><strong>Fit with the Team‚Äôs Rebuild</strong>: Sheppard&rsquo;s skill set aligns well with the Rockets‚Äô rebuilding strategy. He can contribute both as a scorer and as a facilitator, which complements the team‚Äôs young core. His versatility adds depth to the roster and fits with the team‚Äôs long-term vision.</li>
<li><strong>Value Relative to Draft Position</strong>: If Sheppard was drafted at a spot where he was considered a steal, it reflects Stone‚Äôs ability to identify and capitalize on value. Finding a player with significant upside in the later rounds or at a lower position than expected can be a game-changer.</li>
<li><strong>Player Development Potential</strong>: The Rockets have been investing heavily in player development, and Sheppard‚Äôs potential for growth makes him a prime candidate for their developmental programs. His skill set could benefit greatly from the coaching staff‚Äôs focus on nurturing young talent.</li>
<li><strong>Marketability and Fan Excitement</strong>: Drafting a player with Sheppard‚Äôs profile can generate excitement among fans and create a buzz around the team. A promising young player can energize the fan base and increase engagement with the team.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Impact</strong>: If Sheppard turns out to be as good as projected, he could have a significant long-term impact on the team. Building around a talented young player can accelerate the team‚Äôs competitive timeline and help shape the future direction of the franchise.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, while drafting Reed Sheppard could be seen as a major offseason win for Rafael Stone, the true impact of the move will depend on Sheppard‚Äôs development and how he fits into the Rockets‚Äô plans moving forward.</p>
