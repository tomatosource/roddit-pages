<p>Judge Aileen Canon is the definition of a tool for the Republican Party, aimed at delaying trumps trial for treason until after the election. They hope that he gets elected, and can pardon himself.</p>

<p>Even if trump himself isn&rsquo;t planning this (VERY doubtful), you can bet your ass the people manipulating him are.</p>

<p>Once that happens, you&rsquo;ll see real fast who you really voted for.</p>

<p>Biden is not a great president, but he will observe the peaceful transition of power and there will be presidents after him.</p>

<p>Not so sure with trump though&hellip;</p>

They think he will fix America (line he did while he was president&hellip;oh wait he just made it socially acceptable to be a hate filled monster) and turn it back into a country run by god. Now the Evangelical leadership sees him as the perfect tool to turn America into a fascist Christian country that they can run from behind the curtain. Think sharia law but instead of Muslim extremists being allowed to stone 13 year old girls to death if they don&rsquo;t marry the 50 year old pedofile it will be Christian extremists&hellip;.stoning 13 year old girls to death because they got an abortion after being raped by a 50 year old pedofile.</p>

<p>If he gets elected again it will be the end of american democracy. There is no way he will allow himself to lose that power again after what has happened to him since he left office and his cult, the supreme court and his power hungry religious leaders will make sure he stays there until he dies then they will appoint a new leader or one of his douche bag sons will take over as emperor.</p>

These people are not American in any sense of the word, as most of them believe in some sort of dictatorship or monarchy replacing the current system would be better than ever having a democrat get elected ever again.

      <label for="l6k3elf" class="commentText"><p>Yes, but they still operate under the assumption that trump is aligned with their goals. Trump only tells them what they want to hear. Once he doesn&rsquo;t need their vote, he&rsquo;ll change virtually overnight and there will be no way to stop him at that point.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard to believe, but republicans are Americans too and many got swepped up in a cult. It could happen to us as well if we&rsquo;re were upset, felt disenfranchised and someone came and promised to fix everything and acted strong.</p>

<p>A lot of red states lost jobs and opportunities over the last 20 years. Also Immgration affects them much more than the northern states. Then there&rsquo;s the media that whips them into a frenzy every single day. Combine it all and it could happen to anyone given a enough time.</p>

<p>The problem is, trump will be everyone&rsquo;s problem if he seizes power and no longer needs votes. Red and Blue will be in the same boat at that point. It almost sounds unbelievable but is a distinct possibility if the people in power actively work to make it happen.</p>

<p>In such a land of abundant wealth there&rsquo;s no excuse for every citizen not being well educated enough to see plainly that <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> was an reenactment of the Beerhall Putsche, that &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; is literally Hitler&rsquo;s rhetoric (Lugenpresse), that normalizing political violence is the death of democracy.</p>

<p>Rather, there is in fact a downright sinister conspiracy to make the American public dumb. Koch financed propaganda is now in your red states primary schools.</p>

<p>The scary thing is this doesn&rsquo;t end with Trump. The influence and suspicious fortune of shady figures like Leonard Leo is downright disturbing. Frankly I fear our democracy has already been checkmated</p>

People act like he&rsquo;s useless, because he personally didn&rsquo;t give them everything they wanted plus a reach around. Honestly I feel like he&rsquo;s done a better job than Obama, but has done a much worse job of highlighting his accomplishments. When I voted for him in 2016 it was mostly a vote against Trump, but this election I&rsquo;m actively enthusiastic about another term.</p>

This administration has been better than Obama as far as working around their obstruction, IMO. I think now it is easier to do because republicans have gone out of their way to make it known that they refuse to govern or bargain in good faith.. But I think Obama should have been more adept at understanding where things were headed instead of trying to play nice and make everything bipartisan.</p>

<p>There are plenty of built in mechanisms that would stop what the Republicans have been doing. There are no laws that will stop people from just ignoring the law, enforcement and punishment is the issue. All the arguments about them being &ldquo;technically correct&rdquo; is just to try and claim authority that isn&rsquo;t supported by the law. &ldquo;Originalists&rdquo; don&rsquo;t give a crap about what the founders actually said; they merely adopt that term so that they can say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right and you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l6k5v29" class="commentText"><p>Any decent and ethical judge would have recused themselves either upon finding out the defendent was the person that appointed her to the bench or when there was a public perception that her existing relationship with the defendant would influence her rulings in this case. She should have never put herself in the position where even a subconscious bias could affect her ability to proceed over the case in an unbiased manner.</p>

<p>But she didn’t recuse herself because she is a hack. She avoided making rulings whenever possible because she didn’t want to rule against Trump. She has bent over backwards to give him every opportunity in the case because she is beholden to him. Why would you risk destroying your career to put your finger on the scale in such a public case? The only thing I can think of is that she is held back because she fears going against Trump for some reason. Maybe he promised to destroy her career, maybe he promised to appoint her to a higher court and she is afraid of losing that opportunity. Maybe she is afraid of pissing off powerful political donors that have made her promises about future wealth or power. Maybe they have compromising information on her, enough to ruin her career. I mean everybody has some sort of skeleton in their closet, it wouldn’t surprise me if she had one she is trying to keep secret.</p>

<p>The point is she has consistently ruled in a manner that has left legal experts baffled at her decisions. In the biggest case of her career you’d think she’d want to be as fair and balanced as possible, while maintaining the rule of law. This case could make her career and put her on the short list for SCOTUS. Why would she rule so often in a way that makes her look incompetent or corrupt?</p>

<p>I keep coming back to the possibility that she is compromised in one way or another. If she is I hope she is exposed sooner rather than later, because she is currently making a mockery of the bench.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll never know, they shut off the complaint system for anything received after May 16</p>

<p>Small correction in that they didn&rsquo;t turn off the complaint system they just won&rsquo;t forward a complaint that is similar to a complaint received before May 16. So a new type of complaint will be accepted. As in things she does in the future.</p>

<p>“Many of the complaints” against Cannon filed with the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals “request that the Chief Circuit Judge remove her from the classified-documents case and reassign the case to a different judge,” Chief Judge William Pryor wrote in a May 22 order posted on the appeal court’s website.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really what should have been done was Congress creating a separate federal court entirely with exclusive jurisdiction to handle cases involving Presidents, and fill that court with judges from around the country, or different Circuit Courts judges, or something. Anything is better than a single judge appointed by the same President who is being indicted.</p>

Trump has appointed something like 25% of all sitting federal appeals judges, and that would seriously impair the ability of each circuit to convene a panel.  An awful lot of cases involve the president (either directly because of his executive action or tangentially because they&rsquo;re brought against him as the named defendant).  It would be really hard to convene a panel in like the Fifth Circuit, for instance.</p>

<p>Instead, a case of this magnitude gets assigned to some random intro-level district judge.

Congress could bypass all of that with an exclusive-jurisdiction court, where decisions couldn&rsquo;t even be appealed to SCOTUS.</p>

<p>Amy Coney Barrett has never tried a case to verdict or argued an appeal in any court. She was an academic at Notre Dame and considered for SCOTUS. Trump put her on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals and three years later, SCOTUS.</p>

<p>Elena Kagen never tried a case either. She worked in the Clinton admin and then went academic. She was considered for president of Harvard at one point.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They haven’t received conclusive evidence she is delaying the case for improper reasons, nor have they been provided conclusive evidence she is ruling partisanly. This evidence would have to come from a reputable source generally (but not always) involved with the trial.</p></li>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to do the clown nose, because that&rsquo;s general. But a dick in her mouth? Now you&rsquo;re making it sexist / misogynist and we don&rsquo;t fucking need that shit. All you do is give ammo to the people trying to support that clown because you&rsquo;re giving <em>them</em> a piece of moral high ground. <strong>Stop it.</strong></p>

<p>After that it’s still up to Smith and his team to get Trump convicted but at least he won’t have a judge actively trying to ruin his case every step of the way.</p>

<ul>
<li>The judge didn&rsquo;t order the clerk to ignore any further complaints, only those that are similar to previously filed complaints.</li>
<li>Several complaints either have been or will be acted upon, apparently.</li>
<li>The ruling explains that several complaints are outside of the purview of the Judicial Committee, citing relevant rules.</li>
<li>The ruling explains that a Judge cannot be &ldquo;disqualified based
simply on the identity of the President who appointed him.&rdquo; Expert legal commentary has been pretty universal on this point, so this isn&rsquo;t a surprise.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s all very reasonable. The Judicial Committee doesn&rsquo;t have a magic wand.</p>

<p>in case anyone is thinking about filing a complaint.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised there hasn&rsquo;t been more focus on her other cases and how they are going. They might not have to deal with the convicted felon Trump but it would be interesting to see if she&rsquo;s handling things differently in those cases.</p>
