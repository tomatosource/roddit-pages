    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Has there ever been an era or time period with relatively few or terrible star players? For example if say the best players in the league for a season were on the skill level of someone like Middleton or Jrue Holiday instead of the big names like curry, bron, D wade and D rose previously.</p>

<p>Whether through injuries or a gap in time before new big names arrived, has this ever happened?</p>

Guys like Bob Lanier, Bob McAdoo and Elvin Hayes were stars back then.</p>

      <label for="ljfzcq4" class="commentText"><p>70s for sure. Weak era to begin with and NBA/ABA dilution left some superstars in different leagues like Dr J</p>

<p>After that I’d say most of the 90s and early 2010s were relatively weak. Late 80s, mid to late 2010s, and much of the 00s were quite strong</p>

      <label for="ljg21dj" class="commentText"><p>you say relative but relative to what? like relative to that era or relative to current era. if later i would assume talent got better with time. if former im not too sure i only watched since like 1998. i will say tho that era with like kobe tmac vc bron wade cp3 td kg ray etc etc might be the most. this is mainly because the blueprint to a good team was to have a wing superstar that was a bigger mj. so like t mac or kd. and have a dominate pf like td or kg. then have roleplayers pg, 3 shooter, defensive specialist, center. so basically most if not every team had at least 1 star. thats how stern wanted it. no mega team was going to happen. so current teams with these mulitiple studs woulda been superstars on solo teams. also 3 pt shooters are almost the stars now instead of athletic slashers that can shoot. also he mentality of players wanting to stick together instead of wanting to stars or alphas with own team. even 2 stars could be considered crowded then. like 2 gaurd or 2 bigs is automatic trade request. unlike a klay or whatnot.</p>

      <label for="ljfzn9u" class="commentText"><p>The post Jordan - Pre Lebron era was pretty lackluster.</p>

<p>The era was super physical and the biggest superstars, while still all time greats, were mostly big men that worked in the post. Shaq and Duncan were probably the two best players, and both were pretty boring. Kobe wasn&rsquo;t quite the Black Mamba yet. Players like McGrady, Carter and Grant Hill were second tier superstars. KG was more of a defensive superstar. Dirk wasn&rsquo;t quite at his prime yet. AI was special but the team around him was pretty bad.</p>
