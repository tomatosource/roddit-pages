      <label for="lizt0yx" class="commentText"><p>When Westbrook tried he could be a really good defender. The problem is he rarely tried. Seemed like he saved a lot of his energy for the offensive side. Leaving 3 point shooters wide open to sag in the paint waiting for a rebound was his specialty when he was a Laker. </p>

I’d argue some of his best defensive work was done with the Clippers when he took his step back and didn’t have to score all the time anymore. Especially in the series against the Suns dude was a menace.</p>

      <label for="lj0fq81" class="commentText"><p>The problem with Russ&rsquo; defense, even at its lowest points (in 2015, in 2017) was NEVER guarding stars on the ball, he was always able to do this, even on much bigger players. His problem was his off ball defense and the fact that when he guarded mediocre players he basically never ever tried &ldquo;oh It&rsquo;s DJ Augustin why would I bother trying to get over that screen even tho he&rsquo;s <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> from 3 right now, it&rsquo;s DJ Augustin, I&rsquo;m Russell Westbrook&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lj1nk5r" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re grossly overexaggerating. Every player in the NBA takes their foot off the peddle when guarding dogshit players, not to mention Russ was one of the few who actually played nearly 82 games while being the entire offensive engine for the team.</p>

<p>You could look at last season to see that a much older and diminished Westbrook is capable of elite on and off-ball defense now that he doesn&rsquo;t carry such a massive offensive load.</p>

<p>With Westbrook any flaw is magnified x100 and parroted like you to be some kind of unique phenomenon when it&rsquo;s just a small part of every players games.</p>

      <label for="lj1om9d" class="commentText"><p>I mean last year was the best defensive season he has had since like 2013, I have no problem saying that.</p>

<p>I love Russ, but no I won&rsquo;t let you act like he wasn&rsquo;t somewhere between mediocre and frankly bad in some seasons. A lot of stars are like that, not a lot of stars had the abilities that he had defensively tho, so yeah it&rsquo;s a bit of a waste</p>

      <label for="lj1pc3c" class="commentText"><p>I agree its a waste, and I truly wish that the Thunder didn&rsquo;t spend his entire career putting long boi athletes without any basketball skills (shooting, handling) dev projects in place of actual shooters to maximize his playstyle.</p>

<p>However, even at his worst (2017-18) he was never the defensive liability that so many other stars are. They actively lose their team&rsquo;s games by outright refusing to do anything that isn&rsquo;t on-ball offense.</p>

<p>Russ guarding the worst player, and dying on screens sucks, but it&rsquo;s not anything unique to him like it&rsquo;s framed so often. I&rsquo;m never going to call him a good defender in those years, but I&rsquo;ll not see him compared to the likes of Harden or LeCoast ever.</p>

      <label for="lj1qc2c" class="commentText"><p>I never compared him to Harden obviously. Lebron is a different case because even at his lowest points he still had the size and strenght to be a help defender on the backside, which a guard like Russ can&rsquo;t really do, so even tho Bron played with even less effort it&rsquo;s a bit different (Bron also did that later in his career not in his 20&rsquo;s).</p>

<p>I was totally fine with what Russ gave defensively in some seasons (the PG seasons in OKC for example) for a guy with that high of a usage, but he really had some seasons that were almost Harden lite from that standpoint (not quite to that level because he was still solid on ball and switchable)</p>
