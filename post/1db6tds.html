And you starting to watch ball in 08 means you missed the 2006 Wade run, Harden has been in a similar position and has never even scratched that level of a playoff performance, keep in mind Wade was having a similar playoff run the year before in 05, but got hurt in the ECF.</p>

<p>1% TS drop. That absolutely does not warrant people like you spamming this shit in every thread about him that gets made</p>

<p>His TS% for his career in the regular season is 61%. In the playoffs, he was easily one of the most hard-double teamed players in the NBA. For only a 2%TS drop getting picked up by two guys when he crosses half court, how is that worthy of this much disdain?</p>

<p>I honestly think people have just regurgitated all the trolling bullshit about him and they don&rsquo;t actually know anything about his playoff resume lmao</p>

<p>Those stats aren‚Äôt even accurate. And missing the full picture including horrendous turnovers during those games and horrible second half performance. He average 5.2 turnovers a game in elimination games for the rockets. 40% from the field. 32% from the free throw line. And inefficient in the clutch when it mattered most.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m including his stats as a starter on the Rockets up until his injury. That is very clearly his prime window.</p>

<p>do you not know how to use filters lmao. Something tells me you&rsquo;re one of those dummies that doesn&rsquo;t think to adjust for his time as a 6th man when you look at his playoff stats and just like seeing his numbers go down to go up with your make-believe fanfic about him</p>

      <label for="l7pct5k" class="commentText"><p>Did you watch those games? Did you watch the many turnovers he had in crucial moments. Did you watch the poor defensive effort he gave?  Did you watch how inefficient he was from the field and particularly in the second half? Did you watch how he didn‚Äôt elevate his game when his team needed him? Star players usually have worse efficiency in the  playoffs, but usually not worse volume which harden had in those games. There‚Äôs a reason he got rightfully shit on for his performances when they happened</p>

<p>ly scored  26 ppg when his regular season average was typically above 30ppg. He‚Äôs a horrible defender.</p>

<p>You want to talk about select games? How about 10 points, 2-11 from the field 6 turnovers, 6 fouls and losing by 39? Probably the single worst playoff performance by a superstar of all time.</p>

<p>Or how about elimination game against the warriors in 2015? 12 turnovers.</p>

<p>And why are we completely ignoring his time on the sixers? He was still an all star caliber player even if he wasn‚Äôt in his prime.</p>

<p>In the 5 game 7s after OKC he averages 33.7% fg% and 17% from 3.</p>

<p>How about his performance in second half elimination games: 9/3/4, 3 turnovers on 46% TS. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uoo9k3/hardens_second_half_elimination_stats_over_the/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uoo9k3/hardens_second_half_elimination_stats_over_the/</a></p>

      <label for="l7pdo8n" class="commentText"><p>You are literally just spouting off random nonsense without providing any actual references lmao. All you&rsquo;re doing is regurgitating r/nbacirclejerk bs.</p>

<p>You sound like a fucking bot. How did he not preform when his team needed him in game 7 vs LAC in 2015? He had a 19 pt second half to complete the upset. They were massive underdogs in that series. That doesn&rsquo;t count huh?</p>

<p>Game 3 vs GSW in 2019, Harden scored 41 points including 21 in the second half and 7 in OT on 75% shooting, clutch shot after clutch shot to avoid going down 3-0 against the GOAT team. Then in game 4, he scored 39 with another 20 pt second half to tie the series. Not a big moment huh? Going down 3-0 or 3-1 is just as bad as getting eliminated.</p>

<p>Before his injury in 2021, he averaged 28/7/11 on 77% TS against Boston in round 1.</p>

<p>Half of the drivel about &ldquo;elimination games&rdquo; comes from series where the Rockets won in 5 but teams like the Jazz and Timberwolves sold out their entire defensive scheme to stop Harden from scoring while the rest of the Rockets blew them out.</p>

<p>The sample size of games  that he does what you&rsquo;re saying is so ridiculously small compared to the rest of his post season history.</p>

<p>like the best playoff game of Harden‚Äôs career was probably Game 1 against the Celtics last year but all anyone remembers from that series is Tatum exploding and Embiid/Harden no-showing in Game 7</p>

      <label for="l7pbk3m" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s even really true, people just don&rsquo;t give him credit for them lol. For instance, people <strong>love</strong> bringing up how bad he was on game 6 vs LAC, but they always ignore that there was a game 7 where he was clearly the best player on the floor and controlled the game start to finish to complete the upset.</p>

<p>Games 3 and 4 vs GSW in 2019 included a dominant OT performance from Harden, scoring like 39 and 41 in back to back games to tie the series. Both games were insanely important to avoid going down 3-0 or 3-1. That&rsquo;s as &ldquo;big game&rdquo; as it gets.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Harden was ever losing series he was supposed to win. A lot of the &ldquo;elimination game stats&rdquo; people bring up are in games that the Rockets were beating teams like the Jazz or Timberwolves in 5 games where they were just busting out some gimmicky defense to stop Harden from scoring while they got dominated.</p>

      <label for="l7pdle7" class="commentText"><p>I agree he never really lost series he was supposed to win and he probably doesn‚Äôt get enough credit for getting series to that point in the first place. like Game 7 last year doesn‚Äôt happen without Harden basically singlehandedly winning 2 games. but from the other perspective it‚Äôs hard to ignore how many bad playoff performances he has on his resume. we‚Äôve already mentioned Game 7 last year and the Clippers Game 6 but some other ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>23 points on <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub> shooting in the final 2 games against Dallas this year</p></li>

<li><p>11 points on <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> shooting in 2022 Game 6 against Miami</p></li>

<li><p>10 points on <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> shooting and 6 turnovers in an embarrassing 2017 Game 6 blowout loss at home against the Spurs without Kawhi. probably the single worst Harden game of all time tbh, he got outplayed by Jonathon Simmons</p></li>

<li><p>14 points on <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> shooting and 12 turnovers in 2015 Game 5 against the Warriors</p></li>

<li><p>17 points on <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> shooting and 6 turnovers in Games 3 and 4 of the 2012 Finals</p></li>
</ul>

<p>at the end of the day it‚Äôs just very tough to evaluate his playoff aptitude bc he‚Äôs had some extreme and infamous lows, and not that many big highs to compensate for it</p>

      <label for="l7pfero" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think using stats after his 2021 injury is fair - he&rsquo;s clearly past his prime, and in 2012 the dude was 21 years old. Talking about his prime I usually only consider when he started on the Rockets through to his injury in 2021. It&rsquo;s a 9 year window basically, which imo is a fair sample size.</p>

<p>The Spurs one is the biggest demerit against him and it&rsquo;s not close. No argument there.</p>

<p>Game 5 vs the Warriors in 2015 sucked, but they were down 3-1 at that point and it was an absurd run that Harden went on to even get them there. He had just gone absurd in game 4 dropping 45 to avoid elimination and likely had nothing left in the tank. His game 3 was also shit after a really good game 2 where he almost stole a game at Oracle dropping 38. It was a trend with those undermanned teams tbh - he&rsquo;d have to do so much to try and win a game that he&rsquo;d be burned out for the next.</p>

<p>That team was <strong>dogshit</strong> and Harden somehow got them to the 2 seed. Dwight Howard only played 41 games and Harden&rsquo;s main supporting cast included Trevor Ariza, Donatas Motiejunas, Patrick Beverly, and a mix of Terrence Jones/Jason Terry.</p>

<p>They did not belong in the conference finals.</p>

<p>His future wasn‚Äôt looking great considering he had one of his weakest seasons in years at that point</p>

<p>You could say they should have added ‚Äòball movement‚Äô but how would you implement that exactly? The Rockets were statistically better when the ball was in Harden‚Äôs hands and Harden ISOs were a statistically a great play for the Rockets</p>

<p>Harden (and even CP3) never really had a nack for off ball movement that is needed in the ball movement type of offense anyway</p>

      <label for="l7p2oyl" class="commentText"><p>Brother people were saying it as soon as the trade went down. Cp3 may have been considered a little washed up relative to the fucking competition of playing the kd warriors but not many smart nba fans thought the solution was trading him for Russell Westbrook.</p>

<p>There is no fucking hindsight with this trade just like there was no hindsight when the lakers traded for westbrook.</p>

<p>Westbrook is a fucking basketball terrorist.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Russ was declining but still all-NBA level. And towards the 2nd half of the season him and the Rockets were dominating but he hurt his quad in the bubble</p>

<p>The Rockets were also looking at Nerlans Noel at the deadline too, it just never went through</p>

<p><a href="https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/10/17/rockets-reportedly-tried-to-trade-for-nerlens-noel-at-2020-deadline/" target="_blank">https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/10/17/rockets-reportedly-tried-to-trade-for-nerlens-noel-at-2020-deadline/</a></p>

<p>It seems like they wanted to start normal, and then finish with a smaller lineup</p>

<p>CP3 wouldn‚Äôt fit in the ISO heavy offense that the Rockets ran anymore. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that he looked washed in 2019 when his body broke down, and then looked like an all star once he stopped doing so many ISOs</p>

<p>dude gets injured after sitting out half the year. now everyone thinks cp is done for. like all the way. the only reason rockets were able to even get a westbrook is cause hes a god in okc and he asked out.</p>

<p>this wouldnt even have been a possible trade if not for that. now no one thought rockets got better. especially not rockets fans they have history with the man stealing hardens mvp. but for cp that cant play healthy again? okay sure thats fine they just were glad to get cp off the team.</p>

<p>this was what the consensus was. thats why when cp had his okc year it was such a big story no one though he had that in him. and fully healthy wow. but ofc its easy to just say cp or russ kek.</p>

<p>its like if you were to trade cp now i mean most will say hes done anyways right.</p>
