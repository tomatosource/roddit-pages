      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1esyv0u/what_notable_players_didnt_pass_the_eye_test_in/"><p>What notable players didn&rsquo;t pass the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; in high school or college, but ended up contributing to winning games once they made it into the league?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I always hear reporters, coaches, and NBA media talk about the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo;, but I just never fully understood what the point of it was. Isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; just another way of acknowledging players that look like &ldquo;good players&rdquo; when you watch them play? It just seems like such an obvious thing that doesn&rsquo;t need to have a &ldquo;test&rdquo; name associated with it. Either the player looks like they play well or they don&rsquo;t. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>So, the title is obviously a way of trying to unpack the usefulness of the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo;. Are there many players who didn&rsquo;t pass the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; before making it into the league? To me the first player that comes to mind is Jokic because he never appeared to be particularly athletic and he was picked 41st in the 2014 draft, so clearly teams didn&rsquo;t believe he passed the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; or they would&rsquo;ve picked him higher, yet he&rsquo;s wound up winning 3 MVPs.</p>

<p>Lastly, can someone explain to me in detail what the key metrics are of the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo;? Is it just basic skills like passing, shooting, dribbling, etc.? Or is it more abstract like just the &ldquo;vibe&rdquo; the player gives off when they&rsquo;re on the court. Please let me know down below. üëá üëá üëá</p>

      <label for="li9fn69" class="commentText"><p>I like this! The obvious picks are the great guys who fell to the 2nd and didn&rsquo;t jump out in a traditional NBA role because of their size and/or offensive production in college&ndash;Dray and Rodman, of course. You also obviously have Ginobili and Jokic, though they&rsquo;re a little different coming from overseas much younger, but clear examples.¬†</p>

<p>Brunson might be the patron saint of this, since he had about as good a college career as you can have but just doesn&rsquo;t look like an NBA superstar.¬†</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler failed the eye test both in high school and after four years of college&ndash;he&rsquo;s got to be the least likely HoF player in modern times.¬†¬†</p>

<p>Less high profile, but Boozer and Millsap both had strong college careers but didn&rsquo;t look like NBA 4s, so they fell to the 2nd round and then had careers that would have justified a top-5 pick.¬†</p>

<p>This is the guy that was supposed to go #1 in the draft? He wasn&rsquo;t even the best player on that Memphis team! I remember thinking Chris Douglas-Roberts played much better, and they lost to a Kansas team led by Mario Chalmers and Brandon Rush.</p>

<p>A few years into Rose&rsquo;s career and I realized I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong. His game transferred beautifully in the NBA.</p>

<p>On the flipside, Yabusele never passed the eye test albeit he was very productive (overseas), had great measurables and good stats. Visually though it never looked like it would translate to the NBA, the Celtics draft him in the first round and then he&rsquo;s out of the league in two years.</p>

      <label for="li9hep5" class="commentText"><p>to me, the eyetest is looking for all the things that dont show up on the statsheet. say a college player puts up 20/8/3 thru the midway point of the season. that sounds really good, but that doesnt tell me anything about their feel for the game. do they cut? do they set good screens? whats their vision like on offense, on defense. do they have instincts for the passing lanes? whats their effort like on offense, defense, in the second half? etc.</p>

<p>its all the little things, as well as the way they move, their conditioning, attitude, gamesense. think kyle anderson in the playoffs this year. his stats are probably shitty, but he absolutely earned his spot out there. the play that stands out to me the most was him on the left side of the floor, he basically tells the offense to run it right so he can set a back screen for a skip pass to KAT in the corner. play develops, and KAT gets a wide open three, splash. if it were a college game, and i were a scout, it would draw my attention much more than a fancy move, or a tough bucket. anyone can do those, but less can think and direct traffic, especially as an auxiliary player.</p>

<p>i dont watch college, so i cant speak on any players ive watched who didnt pass who later did well. the exact opposite might be michael carter williams. i though he was a lock for next star; lanky, rangy point guard, can pass, shoot, defend, make the big play. had a great attitude, team player. looooooool i was so wrong in the end lmao.</p>

      <label for="li9dsn8" class="commentText"><p>Westbrook was basically supposed to be a worse version of what Avery Bradley became, I remember reading in a draft guide (I&rsquo;m french and wasn&rsquo;t speaking english back then so idk if it was a consensus or just in that magazine) that basically the Thunder completly messed up the dradft by taking him over Love and Lopez and that even if they wanted a guard they should&rsquo;ve traded down and gotten Jerryd Bayless and DJ Augustin</p>

      <label for="li9frj6" class="commentText"><p>Sorry if I mispoke, I didn&rsquo;t mean his NBA comp was Avery Bradley, I meant that the description of him that I read was basically a worse version of Bradley : great on ball defender, athletic but couldn&rsquo;t do shit on the ball while being a poor shooter</p>
