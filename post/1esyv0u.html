      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1esyv0u/what_notable_players_didnt_pass_the_eye_test_in/"><p>What notable players didn&rsquo;t pass the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; in high school or college, but ended up contributing to winning games once they made it into the league?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I always hear reporters, coaches, and NBA media talk about the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo;, but I just never fully understood what the point of it was. Isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; just another way of acknowledging players that look like &ldquo;good players&rdquo; when you watch them play? It just seems like such an obvious thing that doesn&rsquo;t need to have a &ldquo;test&rdquo; name associated with it. Either the player looks like they play well or they don&rsquo;t. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>So, the title is obviously a way of trying to unpack the usefulness of the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo;. Are there many players who didn&rsquo;t pass the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; before making it into the league? To me the first player that comes to mind is Jokic because he never appeared to be particularly athletic and he was picked 41st in the 2014 draft, so clearly teams didn&rsquo;t believe he passed the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; or they would&rsquo;ve picked him higher, yet he&rsquo;s wound up winning 3 MVPs.</p>

<p>Lastly, can someone explain to me in detail what the key metrics are of the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo;? Is it just basic skills like passing, shooting, dribbling, etc.? Or is it more abstract like just the &ldquo;vibe&rdquo; the player gives off when they&rsquo;re on the court. Please let me know down below. üëá üëá üëá</p>

      <label for="liamnkw" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not actually a travel in this clip. He picks up the ball and does 2 drag steps that slow you down. A euro step is when your steps aren&rsquo;t in one direction; ie. first step is left then second is right of the opposing defender. These are the modern rules though which are way looser than the pre-2010s.</p>

He sets solid screens but more importantly he draws a fuckton of fouls. If he can get a deep post up teams will just hack the fuck out of him because of his size. He was #8 in drawn fouls last season, Giannis, Brunson, SGA, Luka, DeRozen, Jokic and AD are the names above him and outside of AD all of them are basically the hubs of their offense.</p>

But current NBA teams love guys who can defend on the perimeter and still provide rim protection inside and defend bigger players. He would basically be a more switchable, more intense version of Rudy Gobert.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a guy who had NEGATIVE Offensive BPM for his career, which falters in comparisson to your example of Rudy Gobert (1.4 OBPM).</p>

<p>Even if you want to compare his peak years in Detroit, he has way less offensive win shares than Gobert in the same time when he was in Utah.</p>

<p>Their TS% also depicts Gobert being a much more efficient scorer than Ben with a 20% difference in that stat despite them both being limited scorers, possibly due to a lack of height in Bans part.</p>

<p>Ben is horrible on the offensive end but he didn&rsquo;t need to be much more than what he was on that end for the era he played in.</p>

      <label for="li9ka3u" class="commentText"><p>He would be much harder to play in the playoffs because NBA teams are generally more ruthless when it comes to abandoning non offensive threats. Players like Roy Hibbert, Tony Allen and Andre Roberson were elite defenders that unfortunately got caught in the transition where their defense no longer made up for their offensive limitations.</p>

<p>Now Ben Wallace was so good that I would think he could transition to a rich man&rsquo;s Kevin Looney on the right team. But it would definitely take a creative coaching staff to utilize him in this Pace &amp; Space era.</p>

      <label for="lia4szn" class="commentText"><p>This is plain wrong. Big Ben is one of the most athletic bigs ever. In a spread out offense, Wallace is Clint Capela on the strongest steroids known to man. He would be able to guard 1-5, protect the paint, and close out on shooters behind the arc. Just using him as a rim runner in today&rsquo;s game would probably double his scoring, but he&rsquo;s also an insane offensive rebounder and his screens would probably end the life of half of this subreddit. Ironically, Ben is more suited for this era than he was the Aughts.</p>

<p>Edit: to add context to his offensive stats from his playing career, his touches were primarily in the post, not really pick and rolls. Post Offense is inherently inefficient, and he was particularly bad as an offensive post player. In today&rsquo;s game he only touches the ball on roll passes and finishing dunks/oops</p>

      <label for="lia65mt" class="commentText"><p>Big ben had bad footwork, bad passing and famously bad hands, not to mention not a good touch around the basket. Clint is one of the best rim rolling bigs from year to year, helped by his wingspan and soft touch.</p>

<p>During his peak years, Wallace topped out at 58% shooting from 0-3 feet, that is an average number even for his era.</p>

<p>I already explained in another video how bad Big Bens offensive numbers were compared to another limited offensive center like Gobert.</p>

<p>Just using him as a rim runner in today&rsquo;s game would</p>

<p>be absolutely insane since the man could barely catch the ball. What you&rsquo;re saying sounds great, as long as you never actually saw him play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: to add context to his offensive stats from his playing career, his touches were primarily in the post, not really pick and rolls. Post Offense is inherently inefficient, and he was particularly bad as an offensive post player. In today&rsquo;s game he only touches the ball on roll passes and finishing dunks/oops</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, sounds great but completely untrue. Ben got around 0.001 post ups per game, and the touches he did get were because he was open under the basket or got an offensive rebound. He was also a mediocre screen setter who didn&rsquo;t play the pick and roll all that often.</p>

<p>Not many Colorado players at that time were getting scouted besides Josh Perkins (Gonzaga) and Dominique Collier (CU)</p>

<p>His growth spurt for sure helped him out but his game at UCCS was definitely noteworthy. Freshman of the year in 2013. First all-American in school history in 2014.</p>

<p>Then transferring to CU proved he could adapt and continue to improve.</p>

<p>I played with him on a travel team in high school.</p>

The obvious picks are the great guys who fell to the 2nd and didn&rsquo;t jump out in a traditional NBA role because of their size and/or offensive production in college&ndash;Dray and Rodman, of course. You also obviously have Ginobili and Jokic, though they&rsquo;re a little different coming from overseas much younger, but clear examples.¬†</p>

<p>Brunson might be the patron saint of this, since he had about as good a college career as you can have but just doesn&rsquo;t look like an NBA superstar.¬†</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler failed the eye test both in high school and after four years of college&ndash;he&rsquo;s got to be the least likely HoF player in modern times.¬†¬†</p>

<p>Less high profile, but Boozer and Millsap both had strong college careers but didn&rsquo;t look like NBA 4s, so they fell to the 2nd round and then had careers that would have justified a top-5 pick.¬†</p>

I feel like in any other league he wouldn&rsquo;t be particularly close without any big awards like MVP or any championships. He hasn&rsquo;t even made a first team. So honestly I thought I was being pretty generous but I guess the underlying stats are probably strong and I&rsquo;m too focused on awards.</p>

      <label for="liaahky" class="commentText"><p>Basketball Reference agrees with you, putting him at 73%. Not a lock, but likely. I agree his equivalent career probably isn&rsquo;t in the NFL&rsquo;s HoF and definitely not in baseball&rsquo;s.¬†¬†</p>

<p>There was a good post here last year pointing out that every eligible player with his combination of All-NBA, All-Star, and All-Defense has made the HoF. He also has a gold medal and was the best player on two finals teams.¬†</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/13ervl8/with_his_2023_selection_to_the_allnba_2nd_team/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/13ervl8/with_his_2023_selection_to_the_allnba_2nd_team/</a></p>

<p>Edit: You know what, I&rsquo;m taking back my NFL comparison. Best player on two Super Bowl teams and 5x All-Pro sounds like HOF to me, but that&rsquo;s too hard of a comp for me to research.¬†</p>

<p>It is just so hard to judge NBA HOF candidacy because like you said it doesn&rsquo;t really require &ldquo;has to be the best of his position&rdquo; or similar stuff you usually think of for the other leagues.</p>

If there was an F1 Hall of Fame it would also be filled to the brim % wise because just the mere fact you made it on that level gives you a great chance at being insanely good.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still hard as shit to get into it, nobody gonna take scrubs and plenty of fantastic players are continually left out.</p>

<p>Rasheed Wallace isn&rsquo;t in it as a example and he was an absolute beast that played 16 seasons. Stephon Marbury another one.</p>

<p>The league is usually dominated by the same 10 players so it&rsquo;s really hard for new talent to break through. I mean look at &ldquo;Avengers&rdquo; Team USA.</p>

      <label for="liarenk" class="commentText"><p>Your first point makes no sense. It doesn&rsquo;t particularly matter how hard it is to get into the league when the reality is you&rsquo;re being compared to the others in the league.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is much more relatively &ldquo;average&rdquo; players get into the NBA HOF than other halls. It&rsquo;s not a comparison to the average Joe, it&rsquo;s a comparison to other NBA quality athletes. There&rsquo;s no participation medals.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the NBA is the smallest league (in terms of number of players), and hasn&rsquo;t been around nearly as long as the other sports, and yet it has a similar number of players in its HOF. Those numbers kind of speak for themselves.</p>

<p>saying Draymond Green didn‚Äôt pass the eye test at any point is wrong to me</p>

<p>he was an all american at Michigan State and it was obvious the team played better with rookie Draymond than a really good player in David Lee</p>

<p>Brunson was a McDonalds All-American and the floor general of one of the most dominant teams in NCAA History</p>

<p>and Jimmy Butler in college was a 6‚Äô7 do it all guy on a college team way ahead of its time. he was a first round pick because of it and i‚Äôd argue his impact was better seen on tape than the box score</p>

<p>It‚Äôs movement and gameplay based I think. To me the eye test is catching parallels in their game that I‚Äôve seen from great players or associate with &ldquo;winning basketball style&rdquo;. Probably the classic sentence to capture it is when people talk about a guy who &ldquo;shows flashes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As a Raps fan, Norm Powell is the most recent example that comes to mind. From his rookie season, he just seemed to &ldquo;get it&rdquo; in a way that suggested he was going to be solid.</p>

<p>Giannis is another one for me. I know it sounds like bullshit now but I thought in his rookie year that he was going to be great. I remember specifically it was some of his &ldquo;coast to coast&rdquo; steal/rebound to layup plays that convinced me</p>

      <label for="li9l2cl" class="commentText"><p>Yabu was only drafted in the mid-1st round because the Celtics had 3 firsts and 5 seconds going into that draft and a pretty full roster already. Ainge struggled to find anyone to trade with to consolidate said picks. Yabu was (in Ainge‚Äôs rankings) the BPA who was willing to be stashed. Also why Zizic if was the C‚Äôs late first rounder that year. But Ainge got Jaylen that year too, so it worked out overall, even if the Dancing Bear did not.</p>

      <label for="li9hep5" class="commentText"><p>to me, the eyetest is looking for all the things that dont show up on the statsheet. say a college player puts up 20/8/3 thru the midway point of the season. that sounds really good, but that doesnt tell me anything about their feel for the game. do they cut? do they set good screens? whats their vision like on offense, on defense. do they have instincts for the passing lanes? whats their effort like on offense, defense, in the second half? etc.</p>

<p>its all the little things, as well as the way they move, their conditioning, attitude, gamesense. think kyle anderson in the playoffs this year. his stats are probably shitty, but he absolutely earned his spot out there. the play that stands out to me the most was him on the left side of the floor, he basically tells the offense to run it right so he can set a back screen for a skip pass to KAT in the corner. play develops, and KAT gets a wide open three, splash. if it were a college game, and i were a scout, it would draw my attention much more than a fancy move, or a tough bucket. anyone can do those, but less can think and direct traffic, especially as an auxiliary player.</p>

<p>i dont watch college, so i cant speak on any players ive watched who didnt pass who later did well. the exact opposite might be michael carter williams. i though he was a lock for next star; lanky, rangy point guard, can pass, shoot, defend, make the big play. had a great attitude, team player. looooooool i was so wrong in the end lmao.</p>

      <label for="licsro6" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. This thread is just about players being better than expected, either because of development or because they don‚Äôt have the normally expected qualities compared to size and/or position.</p>

<p>Jokic and Marc Gasol didn‚Äôt fail the eye test, they were fat and had to get thinner to reach their potential. In addition, Jokic was slow, looked weird and played in a way unfamiliar to his size in a place far away from the normal drafting pool. So I would say he was a surprise and a gamble and needed to be in the right place to reach his potential, not that he failed the eye test.</p>

<p>The eye test is usually used to confirm or dismiss the obvious qualities and accolades like size and stats. And usually to confirm or dismiss great potential talent.</p>

<p>Ayton should probably have been downgraded after a decent eye test. Doncic should probably been upgraded after a good eye test, but then you had the feeling that European talent was a gamble.</p>

He played next to some good players (Early for one season I think, Ron Baker, Shot Maker) but he always stood out to me as the clear leader. He has that quality in him that makes him the alpha when he gets on the court.</p>

<p>I really think he&rsquo;s going to make an amazing coach when he&rsquo;s done playing.</p>

      <label for="li9umgc" class="commentText"><p>To me, the eye test is more about watching a guy play and see how he fits into the rhythm of a basketball game. I‚Äôm looking for hip fluidity when guarding opponents and natural running motion especially on tall guys. Do they have good off ball movement? Can they set screens? Can they navigate around screens on offense and defense? Are they communicating with their teammates?</p>

<p>These are things you‚Äôre not getting from the box score, highlights, or from the physical tests at the combine. It‚Äôs hard to find guys who failed the eye test who succeeded. Most undrafted players who succeeded are guys who are great at the eye test but were undersized for their position. I think a lot of people are conflating eye test with measurable traits like height, weight, wingspan, etc.</p>

<p>I think the best example of failing the eye test was Mark Eaton. He didn‚Äôt even start as a 6‚Äô11‚Äù high school senior because he was so uncoordinated. He was a 25 year old auto mechanic who was 7‚Äô4‚Äù 288 lbs and awkward af when he was drafted. He was talked into college.  Larry Brown didn‚Äôt play him because he was too slow. He was terrible in college even with different coaches. <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/mark-eaton-1.html" target="_blank">https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/mark-eaton-1.html</a></p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt until he met and got advice from Wilt Chamberlain that his career turned around. He was a 4th round pick by the worst team in the league. His own NBA coach said his skill level was a high school player and they put him a 6 day a week training program. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/18/sports/scouting-summer-project.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/18/sports/scouting-summer-project.html</a></p>

<p>He became a 2 DPOY, 5x All-Defensive, 1x All Star, 4x league blocks leader.</p>

He worked as a janitor after high school and had a late growth spurt where he grew from 5&rsquo;11&rdquo; to 6&rsquo;7&rdquo;, so he decided to try basketball again at a junior college. He eventually transferred to Southeastern Oklahoma State University.

<p>If he had any semblance of average NBA speed, he&rsquo;d have been the second coming of Oscar Robertson.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Wachowskis watched Chris Mullin play basketball before they came up with the bullet time concept for The Matrix. Mullin at full afterburner is basic bullet time speed.</p>

<p>Most people point out Mullin&rsquo;s lethal long range shooting. What was more impressive IMHO was he would regularly pick the pockets of ball handlers all the time. He was moving 1/10th as fast as the next slowest player on the court and would just steal the ball effortlessly.</p>

<p>Nothing in high school or college could foreshadow what Mullin achieved at the NBA level.</p>

andrew wiggins in minnesota was the definition of stats dont mean shit because the eyetest made you think he was an even less efficient rudy gay. poor body language, lost without the ball, uncommitted on D, a bonafide chucker who didn‚Äôt take advantage of his absurd athletic tools</p>

<p>but in that warriors championship run he did all the things that make you pass the eyetest with flying colors.</p>

<p>decisive with the ball whether he was swinging it or attacking, cutting and screening off ball, crashing boards and boxing out, hustling on defense and taking tough defensive matchups, filling the corner for 3s and sprinting in transition whilst not getting in the way of his teammates.</p>

      <label for="lia5stx" class="commentText"><p>The ‚ÄúEye test‚Äù just refers to a person using their basketball acumen to evaluate a player rather than relying on statistics.</p>

<p>You are getting caught up but on the term my boy Its not a standardized rubric üòÇ</p>

<p>Therefore everyones eye test will be different based on their understanding of the game. Brian windhorst will have a different eye test than say lebron because they see the game differently.</p>

<p>Finally theres the part of the ‚Äúeye test‚Äù (watching the game) that is simply understanding the discrepancy between a metric or a proxy and reality.</p>

<p>Take for example JR smith‚Äôs shooting</p>

<p>Statistically for some years he was elite and some years he was only good</p>

<p>the eye test will tell you he was one of the best shooters in the league not far off a klay thompson.</p>

<p>Why the discrepancy because if you watch the games (eye test) you would see he would take a lot of the end of quarter heaves and shots at the end of shot clock after the play already broke down. These are shots that don‚Äôt hurt his team at all but artificially hurt his percentages. They don‚Äôt make him a worse shooter only worse on paper.</p>

<p>So the eye test is anytime you‚Äôre using you eyes and understanding of the game to evaluate.</p>

<p>Super ironic my friend worked for the grizzlies at the time. He called me and said ‚ÄúDraymond Green is one of the best players in the draft. I‚Äôm telling you he is killing everyone in these workouts.‚Äù He was sure they were gonna draft Draymond to backup Zbo. GM or Pres of Basketball Ops gets fired right before the draft and they take Tony Wroten. Draymond recently talked about it on Paul George‚Äôs podcast. Can‚Äôt remember the episode. I told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry brother I can‚Äôt believe that Draymond will end up being a rotational player in the NBA.‚Äù</p>

McDaniels athleticism and length was super apparent but his play style was pretty sloppy and he would turn the ball over lots. Stewart was clearly NBA ready but Jaden looked very raw. Watching him now those tools were there from the get go, but he‚Äôs clearly come a long way since college.</p>

      <label for="licubyq" class="commentText"><p>not nba but my sister went to a dance or something with andrew luck. went to like 2 of his games dude was mad average and played in a weak district as well. although some of the best football schools in the world are close to here it was so odd seeing how good he was. hes a very solid human tho. like super humble and great family. i also watched jeremy lin play couple pick up games and i played against his strength trainer. when lin was in houston he attended the church i went to and he got close to one of my buddies. obviously he wasnt try harding but lol he didnt impress honestly. super impressed by his character tho lol. not even gasing it dude was so nice down to earth. i mean attended church ans house church on friday nights lol¬†</p>
