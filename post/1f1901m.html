      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f1901m/if_kawhi_leonard_signed_the_rumoured_2_year/"><p>if Kawhi Leonard signed the rumoured 2 year extension with Toronto in 2019, how would those Raptor teams fare against the 2020 Lakers and 2021 Bucks?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The Lakers probably wouldn&rsquo;t have Danny Green but the Bucks would most likely swing for the fences and trade for Jrue Holiday still (since they choked in 2020). I forgot to add Brooklyn potentially too.</p>

<p>All other things considered, the Raptors would have most of their 8 man core intact and under the books through 2020 and potentially 2021 (Lowry/FVV/Green/Kawhi/OG/Siakam/Powell, Ibaka/Gasol left in 2020). How would those seasons go for Toronto in hindsight?</p>

<p>An important thing to note is that the Raptors wouldn&rsquo;t even be in Canada for the end of 2020 and all of 2021, with those seasons played in Orlando and Tampa. Sucks to know that if Kawhi knew that, it may have influenced him to at least stay for those 2 years lol.</p>

<p>This a conversation about a hypothetical scenario where Kawhi is making the decision with hindsight.</p>

<p>He would know that had championship goals but also know that they didn’t win shit.</p>

<p>So with that knowledge in mind he might’ve stayed another year in Toronto</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s already won twice so I doubt he would stay in the Great White North for another year lol. I mean, if he wants to contend, he probably should have stayed in San Antonio in the first place&hellip;</p>

      <label for="ljythcy" class="commentText"><p>Eh Kawhi recruited everyone under the sun and didn’t commit to the Clippers until he had a guarantee of another superstar there. He clearly wanted to contend for a title still, not just be in LA near family, otherwise he’d have signed there right away and whoever they could get would be a secondary consideration.</p>

<p>If the Clippers whiffed on their targets, I can see a world where Kawhi signs a 1+1 to run it back.</p>

<p>That Blazers team 100% could have competed with Lebrons east coast team.</p>

<p>And Dame is another great example for what happened to the Bucks. Team is 2 stars and no depth. They dont look like contenders next year at all</p>

      <label for="lk0baui" class="commentText"><p>Danny Green leaving the Lakers was a decent loss, but the common consensus was the Lakers had upgraded their roster the year after the Bubble.</p>

<p>The biggest complaint of the Bubble roster was that everything had to be ran thru LeBron and they got Schroeder to help manage that load.</p>

<p>They traded a pair of rim runners in JaVale/Dwight with Marc Gasol (who was washed, but had infinitely more BBIQ) and Montrezl Harrell (fresh off a 6MOY award, hadn&rsquo;t been truly exposed in the playoffs yet).</p>

<p>Injuries made them lose in the first round, but they would&rsquo;ve had another opportunity to run it back had Schroeder not fumbled the bag.</p>

<p>Definitely this. 2020 overall was weird  on so many levels. KD out, Steph out, Kawhi changed team and conference despite being in a winning team already, then Kobe died mid season and covid pandemic&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lk0xoym" class="commentText"><p>I think it would have been very close. The Raptors had the Lakers&rsquo; number up until like last season, at least always challenging them in the regular season. Right before the Lakers went to the WCF in 2023, I was at the Raptors-Lakers game, and AD had an off scoring night but was awesome defensively. LeBron did not play, but the Lakers still won the game in a gritty but decisive fashion, and I was like ok we&rsquo;ve got a fkn shot to go all the way here after seeing that performance post trade deadline</p>

      <label for="ljxj1la" class="commentText"><p>The Raptors went to game seven of the second round with Pascal not training properly for over four months due to lockdowns in Canada. I think with a healthy Kawhi to be the number one option they beat the Lakers. The Raptors had enough size to match up with the Lakers with Ibaka, Gasol, Pascal, OG and Kawhi. Plus had enough offensive firepower on the perimeter with Lowry,FVV and Norm. It is just the same team form 2019 but you add a healthy OG and a better FVV and Pascal.</p>

<p>2021 they lose because Gasol and Ibaka fell off a cliff by then and both were bad and the team had no other big man depth.</p>

<p>I actually agree with this. Most people would assume we lose in 20 but win in 21 (since we already beat the bucks in 19) but I think it&rsquo;s the other way around. Ibaka &amp; Gasol took significant steps back in 21</p>

<p>It was a Rock/Paper/Scizzors type year imo with Miami, Toronto, Boston, and Milwaukee (I guess Philly too, but I thought that year was a temporary step back)</p>

<p>I thought that the Raptors (while not the best team in the east on paper) matched up really well against everyone except Boston. I could probably find messages that I sent to friends betting that the Raptors would make the finals as long as they avoided Boston. It took a miracle for them to even push it to 7.</p>

      <label for="lk0d7wg" class="commentText"><p>The Lakers biggest strength throughout the postseason was their  overwhelming size advantage. They didn’t face a single team that could match up with their size. The Raptors would be one of the few teams capable of matching their size both in the starting lineup and off the bench. Hence why I brought it up, I am under the assumption everyone knows why that Lakers teams was so good.</p>

<p>The other strength for the Lakers all stem from their size advantage and Bron and AD being elite. I don’t think I need to talk about them.</p>

They literally lost game 1 against Orlando on a silly miscommunication between Gasol and Kawhi. Another year together would have greatly helped that teams chemistry.</p>

<p>Ibaka and Gasol were huge parts of that 2019 run and were washed by 2021. I get OG and Pascal got better, but the ‘21 Bucks would’ve been a bad matchup for an aging raptors team with no bigs and tons of injury concerns</p>

      <label for="ljxwtpf" class="commentText"><p>Lou was also in the midst of a horrendous shooting stretch. Harrell was slightly more understandable because he was providing good contributions offensively, but defensively I think it should be obvious to not stick a 6’7 bad defender on arguably (at the time) the best center in the league who has 6 inches on him.</p>

<p>Then in game 7 they started doubling Jokic and that led to wide open threes. Surprise surprise; Murray got stupid hot and the other role players chipped in.</p>

<p>Just objectively from a fan perspective, I think everyone was hoping for that Clippers/Lakers series that was hyped up so much. Doesn’t help that Lakers/Nuggets ended up being pretty uninteresting.</p>

      <label for="ljxj5qo" class="commentText"><p>At the time, you have to remember that Kawhi and Iggy were the two best defenders against lebron in the entire league. AD would&rsquo;ve been matched up against a floor spacing 5 and previous DPOY. Also, Danny Green plays for the Raptors in this scenario, not the Lakers, since he said he decided to leave only because Kawhi left.</p>

<p>Lowry/Green/Kawhi/Siakam/Gasol with OG, Powell, FVV off the bench I actually think is a matchup nightmare against the Lakers. Even the fact that Caruso was such an elite defender is negated in part because Siakam and Kawhi took a lot of the burden off of Lowry. The hardest part would&rsquo;ve been the mental aspect of trying to overcome Lebron.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lakers had the size to match the Raptors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AD is more athletic but smaller than Gasol. While he had the best performances of his career that playoff run, Gasol was hot off of turning Embiid into a potato and was still clearly a brilliant defender who was comfortable coming out to the 3P line. Kawhi and OG were the closest thing to a Lebron stopping duo as you could find. Caruso and KCP were there to hit open shots only, they were not OTD threats to score. After that, their depth chart was only notable for Kuzma and the corpse of Rajon Rondo. The Lakers probably had the best and 3rd best players in this hypothetical series, but the Raptors had one of the best possible defenders against both. On the other side of the ball, Lakers either have nobody who can guard Siakam or Kawhi at any given time. This would&rsquo;ve absolutely been a matchup nightmare for them.</p>

      <label for="ljxmll8" class="commentText"><p>I dunno, Kawhi and PG13 just straight up choked and while it’s convenient to pile that on Doc, I have a hard time doing that after having watched that Game 7 and seeing all the shots Kawhi was bricking.</p>

<p>The more plausible explanation to me is that it had to do with the Clippers not wanting to be in the bubble. It’s well documented that Kawhi and other Clippers voted to end the season rather than playing out the bubble.</p>

<p>Were he to be on the Raptors, and still stuck in the bubble, I similarly expect him to lack motivation.</p>

<p>Nobody is as good as the KD Warriors, but they were a lot better than the Warriors without Klay and KD.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>AD could actually shoot in 2020, they were running double bigs back then (with AD at the 4) and Lebron was still close to his peak.</p>

<p>They also had other amazing roleplayers besides Green. Again they were a stacked as hell team.</p>

      <label for="ljxpq9s" class="commentText"><p>2020 would be a battle of titans. On one hand I do think the Raptors match up quite well into the Lakers and Kawhi gives them that offensive push that the team needed, however I think people just forget what that bubble Lakers team was. I do think that the 2020 Raps would be better than their championship self, but that also just might not be enough for that Lakers team. I think the series goes to 7, but would probably put money on the team that had the two best players in the entire playoffs (if you disagree with that assessment, rewatch the bubble it was not close).</p>

<p>&lsquo;21 is&hellip; well fascinating. There&rsquo;s a lot of interpretations here. On one hand Kawhi probably doesn&rsquo;t finish the season healthy like what happened IRL, however for argument sake I&rsquo;m going to say he does with a different medical staff, maybe just closer to his more recent seasons in production than &lsquo;19. This means it&rsquo;s a rematch of the &lsquo;19 ECF for the biggest hurdle. The raps having lost their premier shot blockers, and the Bucks having gotten a massive upgrade at PG without bledsoe to abuse. By all means the Bucks should be favored&hellip; however that &lsquo;21 Bucks team also would just go wildly cold and play into the wall at times. Not to mention that if this is the ECF Giannis might go down again like he did against the Hawks, and the Raps would absolutely punish that. IMO, bucks still win in most scenarios but it could easily go either way (especially if Nets face Raptors and Philly faces the Bucks, then IDK what the hell happens).</p>

<p>Lebron and AD according to 538 both had jokic 2023 playoff lvl run= 70/80milliin value players as playoff impsvt run . So 2 max players EACH. We didn’t win cos of our role players but cos we had after that season the two best players in the playoffs</p>

<p>Spaced out raptors ? Did you see what they did to rockets ? They’d put AD at 5 play gasol off the floor n then raptors woukd get cooked</p>

In fact, both Kawhi and Pascal were starters in the All-Star game that season.  Now that&rsquo;s not to say that automatically win, but you have to take into account that kind of talent.</p>

<p>Plus, coming off the bench, everybody&rsquo;s darling (now that he&rsquo;s a Knick) OG Anunoby, a future All-Star in Fred VanVleet, and solid role players in Danny Green and Norman Powell, and the Raptors have top to bottom a very good team.</p>

We finished 2nd in the East and took the Celtics to game 7 in the 2nd round after losing Kawhi and with Siakam absolutely terrible in the bubble. From a basketball perspective him leaving was a terrible decision but he wanted to return home at all costs. Whats ironic is he wanted to leave the cold yet the Raptors spent the next 2 seasons in Florida. I also think in hindsight staying with the Raptors would’ve been better for his body since we had no issue load managing him and we had decent depth to win regular season games without him.</p>

      <label for="ljyb3sa" class="commentText"><p>Yes that’s a scary lakers team, but I believe that raptors team in 2020 would improve greatly to likely 62+ wins.</p>

<p>In 2019 they were a brand new team with Kawhi and Danny, with Nick Nurse as a first time coach. They then traded away Valanciunas in February and had a handful of games with Gasol before the playoff run.</p>

<p>That team became so much more cohesive in 2020 with Gasol winning 53 games and lost two starters for nothing. A more refined and cohesive raptors squad with emerging young talent, and a perfect front court to limit that lakers team - I go raptors.</p>

You&rsquo;d assume Embidd would get injured(Bnns gone but you have a massive contract with Harris while max is developing still? Bucks wouldn&rsquo;t be able to afford 3 max players and would restructure, would assume the heat with a aging butler ( was he on this squad I forgot) wouldn&rsquo;t really do much. The finals would be funny because, it&rsquo;ll likely be with a prime AD and strong looking Lebron on the other side. But likely Golden State, with KD STILL IN THE TEAM extended. Would&rsquo;ve essentially won another 2 easy ones for San Fran.</p>

Kawhi with Toronto might just have tipped the balance. But let’s be real: health matters significantly in this narrative. A healthy Kawhi could’ve shifted outcomes substantially—so frustrating to think about what could have been.</p>

      <label for="lk08gkn" class="commentText"><p>Intriguing argument to think about. But it is the usual &ldquo;what if&rdquo;, we&rsquo;ll never know.</p>

<p>So, considering the Raptors in the bubble arrived 1 fought game away from an ECF, WITHOUT Kawhi, and that the Clipper WITH Kawhi were 1 game away from the WCF, I&rsquo;m inclined to say that the Raptors would have been in the Finals for sure. I don&rsquo;t see Celtics or Heat beating them, mostly because the Raptors would have been the most experienced among the 3 and with the perfect supporting cast to match that highly 3pt reliant Heat team.</p>

<p>As for the matchup against the Lakers I would say the Raptors may have been favoured just because of experience and chemistry. While the Lakers had an easier path, the Raptors would have cemented their team chemistry. Lebron vs Kawhi 2.0 would have been much fun. But we have to remember that the Raptors also had Siakam and OG to spend some minutes on James to fatigue him. While the Heat mainly guarded Bron with smaller and lighter players (Jimmy, Crawder and old Iggy) and with a lot of easy switch for Lebron (Herro, Robinson and Dragic when healthy), the Raptors would have much less weakness, mainly FVV and Lowry (and slower Gasol too partially).</p>

<p>On the other hand I don&rsquo;t se the Raptors being anything close to defend AD, as for example were the Heat with Bam. AD played two of the most dominant first 2 games of the Finals ever that year, which caused the Heat to overreact so much to completely unbalance their defense to limitate him. It is possible that the Raptors would have done the same, but I think they would have lived with AD making shots on Ibaka or Gasol.</p>

<p>On another hand (so you need someone else hand to take into account of this 3rd aspect) Jimmy kicked the Lakers in the ass for like two games (also because he played his ass off), so it is likely that Kawhi would have done even worse damage to the Lakers.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the series would have been much more on AD leading the Lakers than what it actually was against the Heat (where Davis played 2 outstanding games just to regress to second star level after that), and the ability of Kawhi to not only outscore Lebron but also to limitate him. It would have been a perfect legacy check for Lebron career too. Could he overcome an all time great defender in his position for once? Or we will remember him for another trip to the Finals ended in a loss?</p>

<p>Personally I&rsquo;m more inclined in thinking Raptors in 7, maybe 6 with some luck, or Lakers in 7.</p>

<p>As for the 2021, too many things happened in 2020 and had repercussions on the following season. Basically if you just take away the title from the Lakers who knows where all the veterans the Lakers massed up in 2021 would have ended? I guess they would have gone ring chasing somewhere else, maybe just to the Raptors. But would the Raptors suffer the same post bubble fatigue that all deep bubble team had suffered in 2021? Kawhi himself got injured in 2021, so it is much likely this to happen again and so maybe the Bucks end up winning anyway. If we are just considering the 2 rosters it is Raptors all days and night, even if in 2021 we have seen almost washed Gasol and Ibaka, so it is likely them to still be like this in Toronto.</p>
