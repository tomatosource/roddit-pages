<p>Andrew Bynum is the youngest player in NBA history to be drafted (17 years and 249 days). He won 2 chips with the Lakers in 2009 &amp; 2010. Was an all-star and all-NBA 2nd team in 2012 (at the age of <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>) but was out of the league by 2014 (when he was 26-27 years old). It&rsquo;s crazy how fast he fell off.</p>

<p>Bynum just never liked basketball. He just happened to be 7 feet and skilled. He was drafted way too young and never matured. He also had to deal with Phil Jackson and Kobe, although successful, were never happy about the task of developing a young guy for the future generation.</p>

<p>Obviously the injuries never helped, but I always figured he’d have been more healthy if he was more serious about taking care of his body.</p>

Gregg Popovich has hated media for the better of part of 3 decades now and is still going. There are multiple other stars in the league currently and in history that have been media averse. This isn&rsquo;t something new, people just salivate over it because the image of a huge white center being chubby and playing with horses while also being the best player the NBA is funny.</p>

      <label for="lt1gzzw" class="commentText"><p>I hate this narrative.</p>

<p>He was so incredibly raw when he came into the league, and worked his way into being one of the most skilled big men in the league. He was one of the last true centers who could dominate offensively in the post, he was a good passer so he fit into the triangle, excellent defender and shot blocker who had a triple double with 10 blocks in a playoff game, and he had a good touch from mid range and free throw. He got clowned on for attempting a three once, but honestly in todays game he’d be encouraged to do so and he would have legitimately been a good stretch 5</p>

<p>He was arguably 1B to Dwight’s 1A as best centers in the league at the time of the trade.</p>

<p>Someone doesn’t work their way to that level if they don’t like basketball</p>

<p>Even as is he&rsquo;s probably going to finish Top 20 all time in rebounds.  If he stayed as a starter for his full career he&rsquo;d have ended up Top 5 easily IMO.</p>

<p>nah. He sucked from the beginning and I always though so. Analytics wouldn&rsquo;t tell you that why he was getting all those rebounds. It tells you if he got them or not. If someone else is boxing out instead of him, there is no metric to measure that.</p>

When you’ve got that kind of money at 26-27, you’ve gotta be super disciplined. Are you gonna tell your mom no when she comes calling for a house or a car, are you gonna go on vacation and not bring the squad? At that age it’s a lot fuzzier.</p>

<p>Counterpoint - fadeaways and dream shakes are objectively the best looking shot in basketball. I think it&rsquo;s more what nba shots coaches train their players to take in AAU, college, and then NBA.</p>

<p>Jahlil Okafor is a good example of a post dominant big man with a lot of moves that NBA coaches didn&rsquo;t give a fuck about</p>

<p>naw b. It&rsquo;s that fact that he is at an age one could expect to be, if they were at the tail end of a (hypothetical) good/long career&hellip; but has been out for a decade. Most guys with good careers retire roughly around mid-30s (which is what he is now).</p>

<p>DeMar is 35<br>
Curry is 36<br>
KD is 36<br>
Westbrooke is 35<br>
DeAndre Jordan for pete&rsquo;s sake is 36 and still somehow has a job<br>
Harden is 35</p>

<p>and this is just a small sample. Point is it&rsquo;s not that rare.  And any guy who is talented enough to earn all-star and all-nba should be able to <em>at least</em> make it to 30 before he retires.</p>

<p>Also the context you framed this in, arguably, was not at all the point of this post. Based on your own reasoning, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal and would be totally expected for a guy who retired 10 years ago to be 44. But at 36, it&rsquo;s at the very least &ldquo;remarkable&rdquo; in the most literal definition of that word.</p>

      <label for="lt1fhpm" class="commentText"><p>I’ll always have a soft spot for this dude, from being the youngest player ever to play an NBA game, to the back and forth with Shaq, to improving and having to start in his second season, to improving so much the Lakers we’re 1st in the western conference at Christmas in his third season (after Kobe’s ship his ass video), to the short shorts fiasco against the Celtics, the rings, and then ultimately the downfall of the foul on Barea, the trade, the half cornrows and ultimately disappearing from the spotlight completely. Had me so invested as a kid, hope he’s doing well</p>

      <label for="lt2f55g" class="commentText"><p>NJ has a great prep school basketball scene so its not very surprising. More surprising is the school being surrounded by such a heavily Indian-American population. And it being neighbors with JP Stevens, which is horrendous at almost all athletics and amazing at pretty much everything else (academics, clubs, competitions, music). Very interesting town to grow up in if you&rsquo;re a future NBA player.</p>

He carried three cases of water to the counter, then hopped in his black Porsche station wagon and drove away. The Sixers lost to the Bulls in Chicago that night.</p>

I’m not even talking about in terms of playing but how physical therapist have upped their abilities in the last decade. Mobility training is everything now. Bynum is like a stronger more athletic Zach edey. Bynum was really really good and was ascending before it all came crumbling down </p>
