      <label for="l6zt10f" class="commentText"><p>Since this comment is near the top of the thread, I wanted to piggyback off of it to make some points.</p>

<p>When we are referring to prostate cancer screening, we are talking about getting checked when you have no symptoms of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer screening refers to getting a lab test checked called the PSA. A digital rectal exam (sticking a finger up your butt to feel your prostate) is NOT recommended as a screening test (though would be reasonable to do if you have symptoms of prostate cancer). Prostate cancer screening with a PSA is controversial. Multiple large studies have been done and it is not clear that doing prostate cancer screening actually is beneficial.</p>

<p>Why would doing a screening test potentially not be beneficial? There are several reason to this. First, there is harm to people who have false positives. That is, if you have an abnormal PSA and have to get more tests. There&rsquo;s the stress of getting those tests and follow-up in the future as well as harm done with procedures like prostate biopsies. These tests are safe overall, but if you are screening hundreds of millions of people, many people will have complications. Prostate cancer is also a cancer that often does not behave in an aggressive manner, so many men with prostate cancer will die not ever having known they had it or having experiencing any problems related to it (we know this from autopsy studies). As a result, there is harm to men who discover they have prostate cancer and are treated for it (due to side effects of the medicines and the burden of all the healthcare that comes with getting prostate cancer treatment), but potentially would never have had problems related to prostate cancer if they never found out. Finally, our treatments for prostate cancer are good, so it may not make a big difference in the long run if you find out you have prostate cancer say a year or two before it starts causing you symptoms because the treatment would have been successful either way.</p>

<p>Most expert societies currently recommend that it should be a shared decision between a doctor and their patient, with either the decision to screen and not to screen being reasonable. What is probably true is that there is a very small number of people that get a large benefit or harm from prostate cancer screening and a much larger number of people that get a small amount of harm from prostate cancer screening. The way this balances out is that prostate cancer screening on average doesn&rsquo;t make people live longer, though how you as an individual value the risks and benefits could affect your decision to be screened or not. I know many doctors who are experts in this field who have never personally been tested for prostate cancer because they do not believe it is beneficial and have yet to meet someone who feels as strongly in favor of screening. If a patient is a coinflip on it and asks what to do, I recommend against screening.</p>

<p>There ARE some types of cancers where the benefit of screening is clear. In the general population, these are colon cancer (multiple tests available, though imo the best way to screen is with colonoscopy), breast cancer (mammography), and cervical cancer (PAP smears +/- HPV testing). Lung cancer screening is also important for people who are prior smokers. There are other specific recommendations if you have certain diseases, genetic abnormalities, or a family history, but that is getting a little bit into the weeds.</p>

There is no prep for a prostate exam. The colonoscopy prep that I was thinking about was a drink that makes you empty your bowels. There was also a restrictive diet and a bit of fasting many hours before the procedure.</p>

So I know cancer treatments have gotten much better in the last few decades, and I know that a lot of treatments mention specialized immune system responses.

<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert but I believe immunotherapy is generally not considered effective enough in most cases by itself.  </p>

      <label for="l6zjqb0" class="commentText"><p>I am a cancer doctor. Every cancer is a completely different disease, so it really depends on which cancer you are talking about. Stage IV cancer refers to cancer that has spread outside of the local area of the tumor to other parts of the body (though a more precise definition of what qualifies as distant spread depends on the cancer). As a very general principle, historically, stage IV solid organ cancers (meaning cancers like breast, lung, prostate) are not curable. There are tons of caveats to this, and just because a cancer is incurable does not mean that people can&rsquo;t go on to lead normal lives. There are also new treatments for certain types of cancers that make us think that previously incurable cancers and now curable, though we haven&rsquo;t had these treatments for long enough to see if a 30 year old is going to die at 80 and be cancer free all that time, for example.  Some cancer don&rsquo;t even use the stage 1-4 paradigm.</p>

<p>Just to give some examples of how diverse cancers are in what stage IV means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is highly curable with chemotherapy. The stage does matter for your chances of cure, but doesn&rsquo;t change the choice of treatment compared to stage III and only has a small impact on the actual likelihood of cure compared to stage III.</li>
<li>Stage IV kidney cancer is probably curable with immunotherapy in a significant minority of patients (it has been standard therapy for &amp;lt;10 years). This was a disease that chemotherapy did not really work on and used to have a bad prognosis.</li>
<li>Stage IV colon cancer can potentially be cured with surgery if its only in a few spots and you can cut out all of the cancer. This is a feature that is not true of most other types of cancer.</li>
<li>Stage IV follicular lymphoma is incurable but is very slow growing and many people can be safely observed without treatment and go on to never be affected by their lymphoma (especially if they are older, which is the population that is mostly affected by this cancer).</li>
<li>Stage IV prostate cancer is incurable, though treatments can work for a long time (probably ~10 years) and people can have close to normal lives in the meantime. Still, if a relatively young man is diagnosed with stage IV prostate cancer, he is likely going to die of prostate cancer.</li>
<li>Stage IV pancreatic cancer is incurable. Unfortunately, even with the most intensive chemotherapy regimen in people who are otherwise healthy, the average life expectancy is only about 1 year.</li>

      <label for="l6ybw5i" class="commentText"><p>Yes but it&rsquo;s definitely tougher.  The odds depend on the type of cancer as well.  Stage 4 means the cancer has spread to an area outside of where it originated, so if it started in a location closer to vital organs you have less of a shot than a location further away from vital organs.  Also keep in mind cancer free is not a guarantee of the cancer being completely gone.  It means there&rsquo;s no detectable cancer and they (your doctors) don&rsquo;t believe it will return, but there may be microscopic cancer cells that escape detection.</p>

      <label for="l6zgtre" class="commentText"><p>Ah, a question on r/nba that I can actually answer for once from an area of expertise as I am a Hematology/Oncology doctor.</p>

<p>First thing to clarify is that every cancer is a completely different disease and the principles that apply to one cancer do not necessarily apply to other cancers. Its like comparing Lebron James to Michael Phelps.</p>

<p>I would say that there are (very broadly) three classes of systemic cancer treatments. Systemic means that these treatments affect most of your body unlike, for example, radiation or surgery that only affect a specific part of your body. These are chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy is sometimes used colloquially to mean any type of systemic cancer therapy. If you&rsquo;re being more technical though, we typically use the term chemotherapy to refer to cancer treatments that kill cells in general but kill cancer cells faster than normal cells. It is true that these drugs are often the culprits of the side effects that you see on TV or may have heard about from family/friends. However, what&rsquo;s also true is that not all chemotherapy is created equal - some can be used in ways that cause minimal side effects. It is also true that in 2024 we are much better at reducing the side effects of chemotherapy than we were a few decades ago.</p>

<p>Immunotherapy refers to treatments that activate the immune system to kill cancer. The immune system is a critical part of your body&rsquo;s defense against cancer. Children who are born with immunodeficiencies, for example, are prone to getting cancer including unusual cancers at an early age. In order for cancer to develop, it has to figure out a way to escape the immune system. There are many types of immunotherapy but they general principle is that they help the immune system find a way to be better at killing the cancer.</p>

<p>Some types of cancer are dependent on a specific abnormality in order for them to live and grow. Targeted therapies, as their name suggest, target that specific abnormality to treat the cancer. This comes with the benefit of having a treatment that mostly just affects the cancer and doesn&rsquo;t have much of an effect on normal cells (though in reality, these medicines are not necessarily that precise and some can definitely have a lot of side effects).</p>

<p>Immunotherapy and targeted therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment over the past few decades (and are probably what you are hearing about on the news and such for the most part), though there have been advances in chemotherapy as well that have been very important. The specific role of each of these modalities and their effect on cancer is entirely dependent on which cancer we are talking about. As examples, metastatic melanoma (a disease that previously did not really respond to chemotherapy and had a dismal prognosis) is now curable with immunotherapy alone in some patients. Chronic myeloid leukemia is a disease that was previously very difficult to treat and remains incurable (without an allogeneic stem cell transplant, which is a very risky intervention) but is now very manageable with targeted therapy that is oral and has relatively few side effects, with patients being able to live normal lives for decades on these medicines. On the other hand, pancreatic cancer is not responsive to immunotherapy and we do not have any targeted therapies that are highly effective (other than in a very small minority of patients with certain genetic features).</p>

      <label for="l6zi37c" class="commentText"><p>Wow this is a very involved easy to understand answer.  Thank you.  So immunotherapy and targeted therapy can treat cancer on their own, but not always.  It sounds like I should treating cancer much more as a class of illness the way infection or viruses are than as an individual thing.</p>

<p>Can you give an/some example(s) of targeted therapy?  Based on how you describe it would be like where you have cancer because you have a certain excess hormone.  Therefore they treat the cancer by reducing the hormone.  Is that correct or is it different?</p>

      <label for="l6zo1cw" class="commentText"><p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Cancer is a very broad class of diseases where there are some basic principles that are the same, but there are so many differences such that its hard to come up with things that are true for cancer in general.</p>

<p>That is correct for some types of targeted therapy. There are some cancers that are specifically dependent on hormones for their growth. For example, prostate cancer is very dependent on testosterone and the mainstay of systemic therapy for prostate cancer is blocking testosterone. Certain types of breast cancers are also highly responsive to hormone blockade.</p>

<p>There are a huge variety of ways that targeted therapies work though with more coming out all the time, but I&rsquo;ll give a few other examples.</p>

<p>Some targeted therapies use the fact that the normal cell the cancer comes from isn&rsquo;t essential to your survival, so if you can kill most of the cells of that type (including the cancer cells), the benefit outweighs the risk. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a cancer of B-cells. These are the type of immune cell responsible for making antibodies and are important for your body&rsquo;s memory response to infection. Part of the treatment of DLBCL is a medicine called rituximab that targets something called CD20. CD20 is a marker that sits on the outside of all B-cells, including DLBCL cells. Rituximab targets B-cells for destruction. This DOES have an effect on normal B-cells as well, but they are not totally critical for your body&rsquo;s defense against infection, so the benefit it has in killing lymphoma greatly exceeds the risk. You are at increased risk of infection, but your immune system has multiple layers of defense so that risk doesn&rsquo;t become super scary (unless you have a global pandemic).</p>

<p>Some targeted therapies use specific pathways that the cancer is dependent on to grow. Some patients with lung cancer have a mutation in a gene called EGFR. In normal cells, EGFR sits on the outside of the cell and listens for signals. When EGFR hears the signal, EGFR is turned on and makes the cell grow and divide. In patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer, the mutation makes it so that EGFR is on all of the time, making the cells grow and multiply constantly and thus causing cancer. The cancer cells are also highly dependent on the EGFR signal to survive. Drugs that shut off EGFR are highly effective in the treatment of EGFR-mutated lung cancer.</p>

<p>There are some targeted therapies that are what we call antibody drug conjugates. Basically what this is is an antibody attached to chemotherapy. The chemotherapy is typically too toxic to just give by itself. However, if you attach it to an antibody, the antibody helps deliver the chemotherapy more specifically to the cancer, acting as a &ldquo;smart missile&rdquo; so to speak. For example, some types of breast cancer have too much of something called HER2 on their surface. This is very similar to the story of EGFR for lung cancer above (in fact, they belong to the same family of receptors). The initial targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer was a drug called trastuzumab, which binds to HER2 and blocks it. However, there are now newer drugs for HER2-positive breast cancer (trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansine) that are antibody drugs conjugates, so they bind to HER2, blocking it, but also deliver chemotherapy to the breast cancer cell, killing it.</p>

<p>Fun fact: there is a trial ongoing for a drug called <strong>Pro</strong>venge, which stimulates immune responses in, you guessed it, prostate cancer!</p>

<p>About your point about radiation specific: yeah we have that too. What are these compounds known as?</p>

<p>Fun fact #2: they are referred to as radiosensitizers. No, I’m not kidding lol</p>

It cured me and the side effects were very mild compared to my chemo. Thing is immunotherapy is  fairly new so its not a standard of care yet, maybe in the future its determined that (for HL anyways) immunotherapy is much more effective with less side effects than the ABVD chemo typically used. Also to answer, no I didnt need to do ABVD to “weaken” the cancer for immuno to clean up the rest but im sure it helped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you exclude the worst category of skin cancer, skin cancers are the least threatening type of cancer..&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also it really depends on the staging when discovered.</p>

<p>This is true of every cancer so it&rsquo;s irrelevant to the original point: if you&rsquo;re going to &ldquo;pick&rdquo; which cancer to get, thyroid and prostate are by and large the most manageable and survivable across the board. The instant you add qualifiers like &ldquo;except for the worst skin cancer&rdquo; and &ldquo;depending on staging&rdquo; you&rsquo;re changing the parameters of the discussion.</p>

      <label for="l70kch6" class="commentText"><p>Is it wrong to separate different types of cancers of the same group? If anything I can state you are grossly generalizing different types of cancers. There is absolutely nothing wrong with specifying that Melanoma  has a worse prognosis than that of other skin cancers by a significant margin. Basal Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma are incredibly common, and are the majority of skin related malignancies. Thyroid Cancer also is dependent on the type of Thyroid Cancer. Papillary Thyroid Cancer is the most common form of Thyroid cancer and has a good prognosis, but three are not nearly as forgiving. Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer has an incredibly poor prognosis.</p>

<p>Picking and choosing cancers is entirely dependent on the staging. If I had to choose between Stage 1 Hodgkin Lymphoma and Stage 1 Melanoma, I would surely pick Stage 1 Melanoma. If I had to choose between Stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma and Stage 4 Melanoma, I would surely choose Hodgkins Lymphoma. If I had to choose between Stage 2 Lung Cancer and Stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma, I would choose Hodgkins Lymphoma. There is no “changing parameters”.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If the original discussion is a hypothetical question of &ldquo;which organ system is &lsquo;best&rsquo; to have cancer in&rdquo; then yes, it is wrong to separate different cancers within the same organ system. Because then you&rsquo;re answering a different question.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re answering the question &ldquo;which cancer is least scary according to multiple categories including organ system, histology, and stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My <em>original comment</em> answered the question &ldquo;which organ system, broadly speaking, is the &lsquo;best&rsquo; to have cancer in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;ve gone this far, let&rsquo;s review the data.</p>

<p>Prostate cancer has a <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html" target="_blank">97.5% relative survival rate</a></p>

<p>Thyroid cancer has a <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/thyro.html" target="_blank">98.4% relative survival rate.</a></p>

<p>Melanoma has a <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/melan.html" target="_blank">94.7% relative survival rate.</a>. (SCC/BCC aren&rsquo;t tracked by SEER because their 5-year survival rate is probably close enough to 100% to be negligible.)</p>

<p>Now if you want to take it a step further and run the incidence rates of melanoma vs SCC/BCC to calculate a more exact 5 year survival rate and compare it to the other two, be my guest.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, melanomas can spread to lymph and blood cancers really quickly, and then things don’t look so good.</p>

<p>Stage 2 - Prostate confined</p>

<p>Stage 3a - Extraprostatic extension, or microscopic invasion of neck</p>

<p>Stage 3b - Extends to Seminal Vesicles</p>

<p>Stage 4 - Invades other adjacent structures: sphincter, bladder, rectum, pelvic wall, levator muscle</p>

<hr>

<p>There is the M score as well. And prostate cancers are graded by the Gleason system so it could also be a &ldquo;Grade 3&rdquo; or Stage 3 depending on what it was read as.</p>

<p>But yes, stage 3 is local invasion. </p>
