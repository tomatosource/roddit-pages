</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Despite still being on the lower end in volume, Bam continues to show an improvement in shooting, going from basically nothing to being able to drop around 2 a night when needed.</p>

<p>Including the Olympics this summer that goes to 22-59, so around 37%.</p>

<p>Coach Erik Spoelstra recently mentioned Bam’s seemingly developing shot as a potential additional aspect to the offense, even if on low volume. Do you all think there’s something real here or is this just “a coach hyping up his player, more at 11?”</p>

      <label for="ls545zi" class="commentText"><p>But certain people on this sub from “that” fanbase were yelling at me that it isn’t possible and to just look at the statistics to definitely prove that it’s absolutely not possible that Bam could ever develop a 3 point shot, even though players literally on their team are prime examples of big men doing so late into their careers? Hmm</p>

<p>Tbf I don’t see Bam turning into prime Kat or anything but even just a couple 3s somewhat consistently would be a huge addition to his game and the Heat</p>

      <label for="ls5ul46" class="commentText"><p>The circumstances are wildly different though.</p>

<p>Lopez was always a very good free throw shooter (around 80% most of his career). But he was a 7-footer in the late aughts/early teens. Dudes just didn’t shoot if they were centers.</p>

<p>As soon as the league embraced bigs shooting 3s, he almost instantly became a medium accuracy/medium volume shooter (he took 5.2 per game in <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> after taking 31 total in his first 8 years in the league). So it’s more likely that he was ALWAYS a good shooter who finally got the opportunity rather than a dude who just randomly discovered how to shoot.</p>

<p>Bam has played almost exclusively in the 3-point era, so there’s always been a green light to shoot and he simply hasn’t. He’s also a worse free throw shooter (more around 75%).</p>

<p>He seems to be developing at least a little something, but using Brook as a point of comparison is probably a poor reference.</p>

      <label for="ls6crfg" class="commentText"><p>There hasn’t been a green light to shoot though, Heat/Spo scheming seems much stricter than most other teams. Of course he didn’t come in being able to shoot but it wouldn’t surprise me if it took a long time for Spo to start letting him even try.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s a coincidence that me counting his last 50 3PA exactly lands back on when he hit that pull up game winner on Detroit. He went from literally 0 attempts to 2-4 attempts per game immediately before and after that.</p>

Bigs are giving him a lot of space especially at the top of the key and he&rsquo;s been very good at getting open in the corners.

      <label for="ls5q2ac" class="commentText"><p>Looks promising but still skeptical, I would assume that most guys making it to the league after the 3 point revolution at least explores their potential from the deep. Sure, there&rsquo;s improvement with repetition, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s outliers, but to go from essentially 0 attempts to shooting close to 40% seems pretty unlikely this fast.</p>

      <label for="ls5x9j7" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting sign for sure, but I&rsquo;m not buying stock in Stretch Bam <em>just</em> yet. He still took less than one a game last year. If he starts taking <em>three</em> a game and maintains reasonable efficiency, then we&rsquo;ll talk, but the percentage doesn&rsquo;t mean much with a sample size this small</p>

<p>Like, for reference, 59 three-point attempts is a lot for Bam, but that&rsquo;s a five-game sample size for Steph Curry. I can pick out plenty of five-game stretches where Steph shot like 28% from three, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that much</p>

      <label for="ls6d973" class="commentText"><p>Him hitting that pull up game winner on Detroit seemed to change things.</p>

<p>Before that he was shooting literally nothing, and
 literally immediately after that game he started shooting 2-4 attempts per game. That was in mid March and that’s where his last 50 3PA have come from. So it makes sense that his season by season attempts per game was still super low.</p>

<p>Its definitely low volume I’m not saying he’s turning into prime KAT or late stage Brook Lopez but I think even just being able to somewhat consistently hit around 2 per game on anywhere from like 1-4, 5 attempts per game would be a beautiful addition to his game. We’ll see at the end of this season but I thought it was an interesting development to keep an eye on this year.</p>

      <label for="ls6eeeo" class="commentText"><p>For additional context his entire career up until last year he averaged only 10 attempts <em>per season</em>. He had some entire seasons where he only attempted 6 threes.</p>

<p>To go from that to 2-4 attempts <em>per game</em> is a huge increase from him, even though, yes, i understand that is super low volume, nobody’s saying he’s Steph or anything.</p>

<p>I also find it interesting that it’s not like it was just some couple-game hot stretch in the middle of January or something, it continued into the playoffs, during the Olympics after a few months off, and after the off season where he’s 40% during the pre season so far. Granted, it’s the pre season, and i understand it’s still a small sample size, but it’s been a pretty big increase</p>

      <label for="ls6leg3" class="commentText"><p>He took less than a game cuz he didn&rsquo;t take a single 1 until halfway in the season. If u just take the games after he started shooting them then ur closer to 2 a game</p>
