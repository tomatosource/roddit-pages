</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>LeBron James tweeted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will truly miss our convos my dear friend! My thoughts and prayers goes out to your wonderful family! Forever love Jerry! Rest in Paradise my guy!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My mentor, My friend! Hopefully I continue to make you proud! 🥲. You&rsquo;re already missed!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://x.com/KingJames/status/1800898659330171024" target="_blank">Tweet one</a>, <a href="https://x.com/KingJames/status/1800909629599420879" target="_blank">Tweet two</a></p>

<p>Michael Jordan texted Stephen A. Smith a statement which he read on First Take:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so deeply saddened at the news of Jerry&rsquo;s passing. He was truly a friend and a mentor, like an older brother to me. I valued his friendship and knowledge. I always wished I could&rsquo;ve played against him as a competitor, but the more I came to know him, I wish I had been his teammate. I admired his basketball insights, and he and I shared many similarities in how we approached the game. He will be forever missed. My condolences to his wife Karen and his sons. RIP Logo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://x.com/FirstTake/status/1800904802093678891" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>Side note, people often scoff at Stephen A. Smith&rsquo;s claims of having notable athletes text him and what not, but there&rsquo;s no way he just made this up. It&rsquo;s interesting that he messaged SAS directly and had him deliver the statement.</p>

      <label for="l8aw9rf" class="commentText"><p>What’s crazy is that he got fired by ESPN in the late 00s because he was considered boring on air and was just a good journalist and not a good TV personality.  Now people don’t realize that before he became a TV character, he was actually a really good journalist.</p>

<p>Can I also note, the subtitle of his book is incredible: A Memoir of Second Chances and First Takes. I’ve never read the book and have no idea if it’s any good, but I feel like it sums up his career with how he went from being considered a washed up former reporter fired by ESPN to the face of the network that they have to pay $10 million a year because of the success First Take. Even if you hate the show and what it’s done to sports discourse, it’s a wild story of how he got to where he is.</p>

      <label for="l8axioq" class="commentText"><p>His work schedule during the NBA season is insane. On the days ESPN/ABC have games (twice a week during football season, 3-4 times a week in the spring, and every other day in the playoffs), he does First Take early in the morning, then does NBA Countdown in the afternoon, and then is often on SportsCenter after the game to talk about it. Literally an all-day grind for him. Sometimes he makes an appearance on NBA Today or SportsCenter between First Take and Countdown too. They also sometimes get him to do alt-casts of games on ESPN2.</p>

<p>And then he has his own YouTube Channel now too as a side-hustle. He’s definitely maximizing his earnings lol.</p>

<p>He worked for decades as a reporter before he became the character we know from First Take. He’s like Colbert where he had real qualifications for his job before he played a character on TV.</p>

      <label for="l8alj8b" class="commentText"><p>West was also absolutely enamored with MJ as well. Their respect for each other and relationship goes way back. MJ also never ever even hinted at being better than West.  Just that he wished he competed against him to measure himself because he knew how much of a challenge, skilled and determined West was.</p>

<p>MJ also gave West the utmost credit on his defensive abilities and accomplishments which as a fellow top defender, can recognize and respect.</p>
