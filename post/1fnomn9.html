</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Vince Carter has done a lot for the Raptors, like dunking the ball, but here&rsquo;s some other fun facts you probably didn&rsquo;t know about:</p>

<p>Skipped his predraft workout with the Raptors only to be traded there on draft night anyway.</p>

<p>Chose to go to a graduation ceremony the morning of Game 7 against the 76ers so he could have an excuse for losing later that day.</p>

<p>Called his whole team easily predictable on offense.</p>

<p>Has a funny quote on his top 10 quotes of all time:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how I got here. In the books, when you look at it 10 or 20 years from now, it&rsquo;s not going say how he got here, it&rsquo;s going to say he&rsquo;s here and he represented the team.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/831771" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>Also&hellip;</p>

<p>Vince Carter couldn&rsquo;t crack a 50 win season in his tenure:</p>

<p>1998-1999: 23-27 (Lockout Year)</p>

<p>1999-2000: 45-37 (Lost in Rd 1 vs Knicks)</p>

<p>2000-2001: 47-35 (Lost in Rd2 in game 7 to the Sixers; also missed the buzzer beater)</p>

<p>2001-2002: 42-40 (Rd 1 loss to the Pistons)</p>

<p>2002-2003: 24-58 (Halfman/Halfglass season)</p>

<p>2003-2004: 33-49 (Beginning of Quitter Season)</p>

<p>For a guy paraded for what he brought to the city he really had a lackluster career in Canada.</p>

      <label for="lojqzi4" class="commentText"><p>That “dunking of the ball” put that entire franchise on the map though.</p>

<p>I know Raps fans feel some type of way about Vince, for good reasons, but it can’t be understated how electric he was especially with his performance in the dunk contest. He was a hugely popular player and certainly brought a lot more mainstream sports attention to the team and even the country than, say, Vancouver.</p>

      <label for="lojxjib" class="commentText"><p>Cherry-picked and arbitrary number. Carter&rsquo;s last game with the Raptors was in 2004. Since the expansion draft in 95, they&rsquo;d not had a 50-win season. And it would take 11 years after he left for them to achieve a 50-win season in 2015. In fact, in the 30 years the Toronto Raptors have been a team, they&rsquo;ve only achieved 50 wins in 5 seasons.</p>

<p>On the other hand, across <em>&ldquo;7&rdquo;</em> seasons with the Raptors, he helped them achieve a positive W-L record 3 times.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just sharing the facts. I really couldn&rsquo;t care less what Toronto fans think of Vince Carter. But this certainly is a case of people using the numbers to support their narrative.</p>

<p>Ask his parents what was more important to them, playing in Game 7 or watching their son walk the stage as he graduated from college. Like let’s cut the shit. He still made it to fulfill his obligation to his team and gave it 100 percent.</p>

<p>When you put it like that you have to wonder how there are better players that won&rsquo;t get a sniff of a jersey retirement just because they played their career across 3 or more teams or left on worse terms than vince did with the raptors.</p>

<p>Also, as a Nets fan, I’m upset the Nets are retiring VC’s jersey. He wasn’t here long enough and didn’t have success in his short stint. I don’t want Brook’s retired either but at least he was here for nine seasons and leads the franchise in points, so I won’t be too upset if they do retire it. Kidd is a very different story, of course.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not who I had in mind I don&rsquo;t think he deserves one either. I was thinking more KD or PG who was loyal to at least 1 of their franchises or won multiple with one. With the bar being lowered so much from the raptors anything is possible even those who play for 1 year and dip. Miami retired Jordan&rsquo;s jersey and he didn&rsquo;t play a single minute 😅</p>

<p>CP’s number may honestly be retired by the Clippers. I know they promised Blake Griffin they would retire his number and keep him, but then he was in Detroit, so IDK.</p>
