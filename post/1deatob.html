<p>Steph was not great in the first three games - in one of them he was downright bad, and in one of them he was just, you know, fine.</p>

<p>And then in the second half of game 4 he got untracked, and he was the best player on the floor in game 5. The Cavs were so flummoxed by him that they sold out trying to stop in him in game six, which is why Iguodala got so many easy points (he&rsquo;s the guy you leave open).</p>

<p>It was a pattern we saw a couple of times that post-season (also against Memphis) where the Warriors struggled to get untracked, then figured it out and the series was basically noncompetitive as soon as they did.</p>

<p>The point is that even with great stats, people minimized Curry&rsquo;s impact on that series. Here is a quote from Bill Simmons on his Finals MVP vote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simmons: I barely considered Curry, but I definitely waffled on whether I was voting for the NBA Finals’ best player or most valuable player. LeBron James was clearly the best player in the series, and Andre Iguodala was clearly the most valuable player to the winning team in the series. Curry was ultimately not part of my choice, even with the understanding that he got the Warriors to a place that they hadn’t been for 40 years. <strong>He simply was not among the most impactful players in that best-of-seven series, and I believe that’s what I was called to vote on.</strong></p>

I agree that the Celtics have better personnel than the Mavericks, pretty clearly, but the defensive scheme has actually made it so Luka’s been given a situation that’s easier to score on. There’s been multiple times we’ve been content to let Luka post up PP. They’ve given JT far more defensive attention. They’re trying to take away the 1st option, we’re trying to take away 2-5.</p>

<p>I do think though that the defensive pressure he’s seeing is not nearly enough to warrant his splits though. Mavs have defended stars that way the whole playoff run, and it’s not like Tatum is being forced into bad shots.</p>

<p>He is getting enough good looks to be effective, he’s not shooting over two people lol</p>

<p>But he is not playing up to his standard. His shooting is atrocious rn. He looks like he&rsquo;s begging for the ball to go in.</p>

<p>That said i bet he plays great tn.</p>

      <label for="l8b3kdx" class="commentText"><p>Imagine how good a team with Jokic, Brown, Jrue, White, KP, and Horford would be. It speaks to how much Tatum is underachieving that he can’t hit the open shots created by all these other guys. Nikola Jokic would average like 15 assists per game with insane true shooting, the only reason he wouldn’t average 30-20-20 on a team like that is that they’d pull him for the entire fourth quarter when they’re up by 40.</p>

<p>Everyone here talking Jokic offensive numbers and ignoring the fact that he was a defensive liability against Minnesota which was constantly exploited. Notice how Ant was amazing against Denver and shit against Dallas? Because one of those teams has a semblance of rim protection</p>

<p>But god forbid anyone on r/nba mention that lol. The uncomfortable truth is that there are certain players (Jokic, Luka) for whom we are only allowed to analyze the offensive end.</p>

<p>and idk, maybe the fact that Tatum is one of the few guys who can shoot poorly from the field and still win playoff games is not just a reflection of the great team he has around him but also at least partially a reflection of his ability to positively impact the game on both sides of the ball even when his shot isn’t going in</p>

      <label for="l8atl5a" class="commentText"><p>I mean, there have been a large number offensive engines who were bad or at least not good on defense.</p>

<p>Like Jokic is passable on defense, but he is a long way from being a true 2 way guy.</p>

<p>Harden, especially in the regular season, was pretty bad.</p>

<p>Curry before he bulked up was also someone who could be targeted. Now I would say he is solid.</p>

<p>Luka had been playing better defense at times this year, but I would still say that he is overall bad.</p>

<p>The key is that all of these guys are such elite offensive weapons that you take the loss on the other end because you are still coming out hugely beneficial.</p>

<p>IMO, it is fine if someone is just OK on defense. But when someone is just flat out bad, like Luka had been thus far (injury being a clear reason), it makes it to where the math becomes much more difficult because those guys can have a good boxscore game, but ultimately they didn&rsquo;t give the level of impact they needed to to actually win the game.</p>

<p>Tatum is a 2 way superstar who is great, but not super elite, on offense. I think part of that is that he is not a natural Point Forward, but that is what the team needs him to be since we lack a great/elite passer playmaker. It is really the only thing we lack. But ultimately I think he makes a great impact on this team every night.</p>

I usually join in the collective hating on Richard Jefferson’s takes as a talking head, but I did enjoy his quote from the preview podcast with JJ today.</p>

<p>“Our expectations are not Jayson Tatum’s responsibility. His responsibility is to help win games.”</p>

<p>Of fucking course JT wants to be shooting better. Of course the guy knows he’s shooting like shit, but he can’t just turn off the shot until he thinks it’s gonna fall again. Those assists don’t keep coming in droves if he stops shooting, if he stops driving and demanding attention from the defense. He’s well-rounded to a level that it’s still a math problem for the other side when he’s shooting like late career J.R Smith.</p>

      <label for="l8ap06e" class="commentText"><p>This is so disingenuous. I can’t remember the last time Jokic shot below 50%fg, let alone <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> from the field. And Tatum’s putting up those splits regularly these playoffs.</p>

<p>That being said, I do think Tatums playmaking and defence does not get enough credit.</p>

<p>But let’s be clear, Jokic is in a different stratosphere. Tatum is an important cog in the system for the Celtics, Jokic <strong>is</strong> the system for Denver.</p>

<p>yes he impacts the game in a ton of different ways and that’s lost on most basketball fans, but what makes him a superstar and not Draymond Green is that he does all those things while also efficiently scoring 25-30 points a night. that he is being criticized for it means that fans and media rightfully expect him to be better than he has been as a scorer</p>

<p>that said, my hot take is that Luka and Tatum have played just as well as one another through the first 2 games of the Finals</p>

<p>They absolutely wouldn&rsquo;t, his team is stacked and they got banged up versions of weak playoff teams in every round. If Tatum and Porzingus swapped injury concerns this playoffs, the Celtics would be in pretty much the exact same place.</p>

      <label for="l8bab1e" class="commentText"><p>How bout these apples- as a Celtic fan IDGAF how the dumb-as-rocks nba “discourse” ranks Tatum. Literally couldn’t care less- because what this Cs team is demonstrating AMPLY is that team basketball beats heliocentric starball, Tatum regardless of any punditry is the leader in points, rebounds, and assists of a historically good championship team that is skullfucking the winner of the supposedly so-much-better Western Conference, as has amply demonstrated that however good he is, it’s good enough for a team built around him to win a chip, and very possibly more than one. </p>

<p>If you think Luka is better, fine, but that man is a giant problem for his own team on defense and I’m surprised it didn’t bite them in the ass sooner. Jokic, sure, but his team lost to the runner up to the runner up. Whatever, loudly, for the cheap seats, it doesn’t matter at all what anybody ranks Tatum league wide as an individual player, his team is 78-20 and fixing to win a championship in his age 26 season. Frankly, the fact that Tatum can be in a shooting slump (my personal opinion he put on too much muscle last summer and his shot mechanics have not adjusted) and the Cs, likely to remain together in this core for the next several years, are dominant to this extent, should <em>literally scare the rest of the league shitless</em>. Bc the instant Tatum finds his shot (which he 1000% will do), Cs are prohibitive KD Warrior level favorites for the foreseeable future barring injury.</p>

<p>So have fun with y’all’s little shade-throwing cope tantrum. We will sit back and hold these Ws. </p>

Tatum has proved he’s a top NBA player year in and year out for the past few years. If you think he’s going to keep shooting 31%, power to you. I don’t think that’s going to be the case.</p>

      <label for="l8bjm41" class="commentText"><p>He’s putting up 17 PPG on 31.5% from the field, it’s not really “nit picking”, his scoring has been trash.  He is playing good D, passing and rebounding well, don’t get me wrong he hasn’t been an anchor or anything, but he’s been very weak for a #1 on a championship level team.  It’s only 2 games, he’ll probably improve as the series goes on, but his scoring has been legit bad so far.</p>

<p>Also … re: the Jokic/Luka comps, they’d definitely be getting criticized if they were scoring this poorly.  They also wouldn’t be up 2-0, they’d be down 2-0, because they don’t have stacked teams like Tatum.  Through 2 games in the finals Tatum has been somewhere between the 3rd and 5th best player for Boston (clearly below Jrue and Brown, arguable with White and Porzingis).</p>

<p>I think the criticism also comes from history.  For some time plenty of people have been trying to argue that Tatum is on the same tier as the top guys like Jokic, Luka, Giannis and Embiid, but a lot of people, myself included, just don’t see it.  He’s easily top 10, but he’s also clearly a tier below the top 4, and this postseason is just more evidence of that.</p>

<p>Notice Parsons’ own choice of words - “they’re” dominating this postseason. Not “he’s” dominating this postseason.</p>

<p>The team is built this way because Stevens and before him Ainge understand who Tatum is and who he isn’t. They can carry him through these mental slumps he goes through when the lights are bright.</p>
