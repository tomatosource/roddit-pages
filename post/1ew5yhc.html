    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I want to make this clear as it wasn&rsquo;t clear in the original post about TB&rsquo;s list. This is about peaks, so longevity should not play a major factor in the voting. A lot of people were unhappy with how TB&rsquo;s list turned out so let&rsquo;s see how much better we did. With all that said, here is the list. The percentages is how many of their head-to-head votes they won</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stephen Curry (91%)</p></li>

<li><p>LeBron James (83%)</p></li>

<li><p>Nikola Jokic (79%)</p></li>

<li><p>Kevin Durant (75%)</p></li>

<li><p>James Harden (73%)</p></li>

<li><p>Luka Doncic (68%)</p></li>

<li><p>Giannis Antetekounmpo (49%)</p></li>

<li><p>Joel Embiid (47%)</p></li>

<li><p>Damian Lillard (35%)</p></li>

<li><p>Kawhi Leonard (33%)</p></li>

<li><p>Chris Paul (31%)</p></li>

<li><p>Russell Westbrook (26%)</p></li>

<li><p>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (25%)</p></li>

<li><p>Kyrie Irving (22%)</p></li>

<li><p>Trae Young (14%)</p></li>

      <label for="liwc8li" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. He had the highest offensive rating of all time iirc. He transforms offenses alongside dropping 20 ppg on great percentages and being automatic from midrange, plus his playoff numbers do take a jump despite his rep.</p>

<p>His 2015 season was statistically incredible. Shot very close to 50/40/90 from the floor. That Clippers team would’ve been dogshit without him.</p>

<p>Much as a I love Jokic, I might put Harden ahead of him if we&rsquo;re talking regular season only.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying 3 PT spacing and gravity is not important - in fact, it&rsquo;s one of the most important parts of impact. BUT, I feel as if Thinking Basketball doesn&rsquo;t consider Paint Gravity. For example, Giannis forcing teams to build walls is a form of extremely valuable paint gravity.</p>

<p>I think these two value judgements he makes explains why Giannis and Embiid don&rsquo;t appear on his list.</p>

      <label for="liwjev1" class="commentText"><p>It’s that, but also that Giannis and Embiid have not driven elite postseason offense to the same extent as those Ben Taylor has above them, and to the extent they have driven elite regular season offense, they have done it with three-point shooting offense around them. Curry, for example, didn’t need an elite paint offensive player to break basketball in 2016. LeBron needs shooting to be most effective but has driven elite playoff offense.
Really, shooting is beneficial for everyone cause there are fewer diminishing returns and fewer solutions on defense. You can pack the paint against Giannis (and Embiid, though Embiid has been limited one on one in the past); you can’t sell out to take away all threes cause a layup is the most valuable shot, and there’s more space to cover on the perimeter anyway</p>

      <label for="liwru3f" class="commentText"><p>I didn’t say they aren’t important. I think they are very important. I just think Thinking Basketball overvalues them, especially 3 pt spacing.</p>

<p>You have LBJ and Jordan, the two highest offensive peaks of all time, not being great 3 pt shooters (probably could add shaq in there as well, jokic ain’t a great 3 pt shooter besides like 1 year as well). Jordan and Shaq are also not the best of the best playmakers (neither is curry). Yet these 5, I agree, are the highest peaks.</p>

<p>What I’m arguing is that these are important, but not the end-all-be-all. There are diminishing returns - having no playmaking will eliminate you from any top peaks, but having serviceable playmaking/3pt spacing vs. Elite playmaking/3pt spacing isn’t as big of a gap as going from 0 to serviceable.</p>

<p>Giannis is a great example proving their point because if you compare him to Lebron, he’s just not able to punish defenses for that “paint gravity” that he generates at the same level, which in turn makes it easier to scheme against him in the playoffs which hurts his efficiency, and the result is that teams with Giannis as the offensive focal point haven’t had fantastic playoff offenses. I think they make a pretty strong case for every player on their list in this lace of him.</p>

      <label for="liwlrkb" class="commentText"><p>I agree with your point but I still don’t agree with your conclusion on Giannis.</p>

<p>Giannis has a crazy amount of gravity but he’s also just susceptible to certain defenses much more than other offensive super weapons. The thing with walls and heavy shading is when executed correctly, rotations aren’t crazily strained especially in the full court.</p>

<p>Also on top of that, we’ve seen teams like the Celtics guard Giannis nearly one on one for most of the series and have success with his efficiency.</p>

      <label for="liwvo0l" class="commentText"><p>The fact that building a wall to stop Giannis was legit is not an argument for him, it&rsquo;s an argument against him. He was really poor at passing out of double teams so he couldn&rsquo;t punish it. If you put 3 players on Joker it&rsquo;s an instant bucket instead.</p>

      <label for="liwxfpd" class="commentText"><p>Becuse in playoffs team can limit your offensive inpact if you have some weakneses im the game. As amazing as Giannis is he cant shoot and he is not the same level of passer as other players on this list. It shows in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Embid is better at scoring from all levels but his passing also isnt on the same level as top 5 on TB list. It was also the reason for Kawhai and KD not being in top 5.</p>

      <label for="lix05vn" class="commentText"><p>They talk about paint gravity on their podcast and about Giannis specifically having it—they also note that he’s less efficient and less effective in the playoffs than some of these other players which I think is a fair critique. Giannis has fewer dimensions to excel along if one is taken away by a great defensive coach with time to target his weaknesses. Same with Embiid.</p>

<p>Both of those guys are <em>also</em> excellent defenders and more valuable in total than some of the players above them, but this is purely an offensive exercise. </p>

      <label for="lix67si" class="commentText"><p>Eh I dunno man. Giannis hasn&rsquo;t had a playoff run above league average efficiency since the title run. There&rsquo;s still a predictability to Giannis&rsquo; offensive game that makes it far easier to scheme against him in the playoffs than most offensive stars. No way is he a top-10 offensive player of the last 10 years when you look at his playoff output.</p>

      <label for="liwysxc" class="commentText"><p>I been a fan of Ben for over a decade since his realgm days.</p>

<p>You are correct about him over valuing shooting. I remember him saying MJ was more scalable tho it’s matter of team fit for Lebron n Mj because mj was better off ball. And untill I understood basketball more I didn’t disagree . But now I think what- are midrange curl jumpers meant to make up for everything Bron is better at off ball?</p>

<p>Better off ball defender, better cutter( Lebron has led the league in cutting efficiency multiple years in LA in his old age his combo of size speed athlecism strength and iq make him even by bens recent admission an all timer in cutting ), better roll man /pnr partner - the things I listed before including a 3 pt shot that’s 41% + over his lakers tenure when wide open make him an incredibly versatile n deadly roll man- go watch 2023 with Westbrook Lebron two man game with no spacing in December n January especially, better lob target , mj is great in transition bud Lebron is all time there and ofc Lebron iq n passing translates incredibly well
Off ball. We see it more now in his older age wether in Olympics or nba he’s happy letting wirse playmakers be on ball.  I think just cos Lebron is an all time on ball player and you want him having the ball people have under rated how good he is off ball and if you watch him on the lakers particularly since 21 when we got Schroeder I think it dispels that idea . More to off ball game then shooting even if that is huge thing ofc . Tho mb Ben has seen this n changed a bit- I think mb he has cos he mentioned it to why Lebron is clear of Luka , but off ball game isn’t just gravity . AD can’t shoot for shit from three but he’s great off ball .</p>

Mj pretty good but slight efficiency drop.</p>

<p>The only reason it was really even close was because Curry just had one of his worst shooting games of his career in game 2, for the playoffs as a whole Curry was clearly better offensively with Lebron&rsquo;s efficiency going down the drain.</p>

<p>The thing is it&rsquo;s not only Steph. No one after Lebron&rsquo;s debut has ever been better than Lebron at any point. Wade and Melo from the 2003 draft class probably for like a season each at the very start of their careers but Lebron has been the best player in the league since 2008 imo.</p>

<p>The playoffs are what makes it close because there is more uncertainty with the Curry there and because the sample is much smaller. If we’re talking just regular season Jokic and Curry would be in a class of their own post 2014(Maybe harden would be in that group too).</p>

      <label for="liwpdc0" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m taking playoff 2017 LeBron any day&hellip;</p>

<p>Steph was putting up 28.1 and 6.7 on 66%TS, LeBron&rsquo;s putting up 32.8 and 7.8 on 65%TS.</p>

<p>Come finals, Steph&rsquo;s putting up a great 27 and 9 on 62%TS, but LeBron was giving 34 and 10 on 63%TS</p>

<p>I know Steph&rsquo;s off-ball impact is huge, but I also don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a coincidence that he&rsquo;s cooking in the playoffs finally once KD arrives. Steph&rsquo;s gravity made life easy for KD, but KD definitely made life easy for Steph too.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;d take LeBron, ultimately the problem is in trying to compare two totally different guys. LeBron&rsquo;s <em>significantly</em> better in the playoffs at being the driving force of an offense. Steph is nowhere near him in that area, but where he does shine is that he&rsquo;s of course the greatest offensive auxiliary player in NBA history. While we can try and have metrics do a lot of the dirty work for us, I think a lot of it comes down to taste and preferences if you really are trying to compare the two.</p>

      <label for="liwtifv" class="commentText"><p>Steph was really good in the 2015 playoffs as well he actually led the playoffs in a bunch of one number metrics. So it’s not like 2017 was his first good playoff run.</p>

<p>In the 2017 there is a decently big disparity in minutes between the two, so if you look at the numbers per 75 possessions I think Curry’s look better IIRC. Which is probably why Obpm likes him more.</p>

<p>Curry’s driven some really good playoff offenses, his ability to do that and also be able to still retain much of his value with other ball dominant stars is what makes him so great offensively.</p>

      <label for="liwigao" class="commentText"><p>The guy was averaging 36 and 6 on 65%TS before the injury, and topped the all-time points per-100 list by a <em>wide</em> margin.</p>

<p>Compared to peak Harden per-100 - who I have no issue with being over Embiid offensively - Embiid was +2.7 points for only -1.8 assists. Swinging back in Embiid&rsquo;s favor is that he was -1 turnover compared to Harden, and had a higher relative TS(111 for Embiid vs 110 for Harden)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a valid statistical argument to have him at the same level as peak Harden</p>

<p>Considering all that, to have SGA on the list over him is fucking crazy. SGA just put up 30 and 6 on 63.6%TS and they had him over Embiid&hellip; The gap between the two in points per-100 was <em>eight points</em>. That&rsquo;s fucking massive with less TS% and basically identical assists. SGA&rsquo;s lower on turnovers, but that&rsquo;s it and it&rsquo;s not nearly enough to make up for the massive gap in scoring+efficiency.</p>

<p>I love SGA, and sure I&rsquo;m biased as hell, but they fumbled that one man</p>

<p>The only way I can see having SGA over Embiid is if you define &ldquo;peak&rdquo; broadly enough to include SGA&rsquo;s 75 games this year but narrowly enough to exclude Embiid&rsquo;s 66 last year + pre-injury this year.</p>

<p>And that just feels too fiddly to me.</p>

      <label for="liwvtm8" class="commentText"><p>I think his idea was that Embiid&rsquo;s playoff sample is muddy with injuries and that some of the drop-off may have been his playmaking, which are is peaking rn but we haven&rsquo;t seen in the playoffs yet.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s 100% a case for Embiid. Personally, I vibe more with the idea that a healthy Embiid would be better than SGA in the playoffs, but I think it&rsquo;s fair to argue for Shai given how resilient his scoring seems to be.</p>

      <label for="liwqg0d" class="commentText"><p>In regards to playoffs I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit Joel has underperformed in the past. Injuries played a part, and I think he also just struggled to top it off.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re focusing on peaks though, I think we&rsquo;re allowed to focus in on this season and time missed shouldn&rsquo;t really matter - it&rsquo;s peak performance not overall greatness.</p>

<p>Embiid this year was great in the playoffs. The Knicks had a great playoff defense and great pieces to hound Embiid, and he still put up 33 and 6 offensively on 59%TS despite a totally busted knee, constant migraines, and bells palsy paralyzing half his face. If that isn&rsquo;t a pretty damn good showing, what is?</p>

<p>Does SGA&rsquo;s 30 and 6 on 58%TS in the playoffs this year, -3ppg and lower TS, really make him deserve the spot more than Embiid?</p>

Idk how you argue KD scales better when Curry&rsquo;s Warriors without KD have reached greater heights than KD without Curry.  Thinking Basketball argument of a players ability to fit in with higher end talent being more valuable than a players ability to raise the floor as a lone star is something I think most people can&rsquo;t wrap their heads around. In basketball, there are limited amount of possessions players have can have with using the ball, and there is only one. So off Ball movements is something that is very valuable to making finishing plays more efficient.</p>

      <label for="liwkd3i" class="commentText"><p>Idk what we’re defining as “prime” but I will say, I think harden is an incredible offensive player. One of the best in history. Yet, if you look beyond just the raw ppg numbers, his regular season advanced numbers are in goat offensive player territory while the playoff advanced numbers are in very good offensive territory. I’m not trying to talk bad on harden, just that when op says harden is above players like Lebron and jokic offensively, it needs more than just raw ppg to sort through.</p>

      <label for="liwlztl" class="commentText"><p>Very good? Again, harden from 14-20 averaged 29 and 7 on 59% TS.</p>

<p>For some comp:</p>

<p>Kd before running to play with Steph/klay spacing: 29 ppg on 58% TS.</p>

<p>Curry from 15-22: 27 ppg on 61% TS.</p>

<p>Kobe from 01-10: 29 ppg on 55% TS.</p>

<p>Realistically what more do we want harden to fucking do?</p>

<p>Harden has to average 35 on 65 TS to get the same recognition his peers do for less</p>

<p>Edit: and for the people that say “oh but his lows”, take a second and consider that due to how averages work, that would mean he has to have even higher highs for his numbers to turn out like they are</p>

      <label for="liwoet8" class="commentText"><p>Again I feel like you’re ignoring the crux of my argument. If op is going to claim that harden is above players like Lebron and jokic, then his advanced offensive numbers have to show that. I’m talking about more than just ppg. His OBPM, BPM, WS/48, true shooting, OWS, on/off numbers, all come down from goat level offensive regular season player. Those other guys maintain theirs.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, if he’s above Lebron and jokic offensively as op claims, then yes, that’s what he has to do to show that. No one on here is claiming those other players you pointed are better offensive players than jokic or Lebron.</p>

      <label for="liweuip" class="commentText"><p>LeBron should unquestionably be #1, cmon now. LeBron&rsquo;s defense and two-way play (as elite as it is) isn&rsquo;t the reason he&rsquo;s considered a top 2 GOAT. It&rsquo;s his offense.</p>

<p>LeBron literally outperformed Curry on offense in every one of the four Finals matchups (2015-18) between them.</p>

<p>If Curry is having a good shooting game, then yes, he&rsquo;s better. But he has a lot of off games (including these Olympics where he started the first 3-4 tournament games shooting around 30% from the field). LeBron never really has an off game offensively due to his slashing and playmaking.</p>

<p>If I need a purely offensive player for a playoff series, there is no way I&rsquo;m taking prime Curry over prime LeBron.</p>

Curry has some of the most insane playoff scoring runs of all time right alongside LeBron, but he doesn&rsquo;t have to dominate the ball to do it, totally reasonable to give him the edge. Jokic might be the GOAT passer &amp; is a big with spacing value too.</p>

      <label for="liwm5ot" class="commentText"><p>If James Harden is getting knocked for his playoff performances, should Steph really be #1 I wonder? Not that Steph underperforms, but he doesn&rsquo;t quite overperform either. I know the numbers don&rsquo;t tell the whole story with him, but he&rsquo;s never really had an all-time offensive campaign in the playoffs</p>

<p>You also have to ask, what season is peak Steph? Do you use 2016? Sure that regular season was as good as any I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but come playoffs he averaged 25 and 5 with over 4topg on 60%TS&hellip; That&rsquo;s good, but it&rsquo;s far from stellar and in the Finals he averaged just 22ppg and 4apg with more TOV than assists on 58%TS&hellip; He was objectively bad for a player of his caliber.</p>

<p>Meanwhile LeBron in those Finals was giving the Warriors 30 and 9 with a 2:1 A:TO and as we all know he closed the series in historic fashion. When they were losing to the KD Warriors, note KD was the FMVP of these teams and their scoring leader, LeBron was putting up 34 and 10 on 63%TS one year and 34 and 10 on 64%TS the next. Even in 2020 LeBron was putting up 30 and 9 on 67%TS in the Finals.</p>

<p>If playoffs matter a lot, LeBron so clearly outclasses Steph time and time again.</p>

      <label for="liwsvow" class="commentText"><p>James Harden boxscore overstate his value as an offensive player. He is a all time great floor raiser. But things like his relatively limited counters to defensive scheming to his stepback threes and foul baiting. The fact he needs the ball like 60% of the time to optimize his value. Really limits the ceiling of teams that he has to be built around.</p>

      <label for="liwnb29" class="commentText"><p>I think I like TB&rsquo;s top six better, but prefer the inclusion of Giannis and Embiid over Paul and SGA. It&rsquo;s really SGA who is the outlier, there - I think CP3 is certainly a reasonable inclusion, but I have a hard time understanding SGA over Embiid and Giannis.</p>

<p>But, Ben Taylor being who he is, I&rsquo;m sure if I check out his analysis he&rsquo;ll make a compelling argument as to why I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>His great strength is as a scorer and defender. He’s best when used with a traditional guard, like a prime CP3/Kawhi duo would be absolutely deadly. It’s honestly a big issue the clippers have run into outside injuries</p>

      <label for="lix0l2m" class="commentText"><p>I do love Thinking basketball but I don&rsquo;t think Luka is this high I know it&rsquo;s recency bias and he just made the playoffs and played well but context matters. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s even better than prime James Harden. Harden lost to the KD warriors and 62 Win Kawhi Spurs in the playoffs.</p>

<p>As far as the Reddit List we need to see CP3 here he changes Franchise immediately Nola Hornets, Clippers, Rockets, Thunder, Suns. This cannot be ignored I know he does not have the playoff success but he&rsquo;s done a hellavu lot more than Embiid and Dame. I know he doesn&rsquo;t put up insane stat lines but he controls the game and pace way better than any player on this list not named Lebron. He undoubtedly needs to be Top 10 and he&rsquo;s closer to 5 than he is 10</p>

His GOAT series’ are a good example, and I have what he’s written about Wilt Chamberlain as a copy and pasted example of a larger theme of using data in that way (last paragraph is worst example):</p>

<p>I would take Russell over Wilt all-time, but a lot of his analysis on Wilt is imo intentionally misleading to try to produce a contrarian opinion.</p>

<p>For example, if you look at his six years with the Warriors, without fail the more shots he took, the better his team’s offenses performed relative to the league. In 67 there was the huge jump when he took fewer shots, but that had a lot to do with the emergence of Billy Cunningham, the improvement of his Sixers’ supporting cast while he was around (just compare the 63-64 and 68-69 Sixers), and the fact that Wilt had a crazy outlier season even for him, shooting 16%!!! better from the field than anyone else in the league. Taylor very actively minimizes any consideration of improvement to his supporting cast, and glosses over the last part as well.</p>

<p>Taylor’s biggest crime in those writeups though is using pace data 60 years apart (which would make any scorer from the 60s look much worse relative to their time than they were), and took a Wilt scoring rate against Russell (by itself would have led the league in five of the seven years in question) and compared it to David Lee in 2010 and Roy Tarpley in a 19 game season (doesn’t mention the 19 games). For me, his writeups on Wilt are an example of how you can manipulate and interpret data to try to make it say whatever you want it to say</p>
