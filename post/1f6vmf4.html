<p>Kind of a crazy stat with how much &ldquo;load management&rdquo; superstars have these days</p>

<p>Even the most durable stars now like Tatum or Jokic will rest enough to play closer to 75 games a year</p>

<p>A different time. But everyone did that. So ofcourse, if you were Jordan or any other all time great, you still had more talent in the bank to stand out than unfit average Joe.</p>

      <label for="ll3cpvj" class="commentText"><p>you&rsquo;re trying to imply that he did all these things, and still was awesome when the truth is so did the rest of the field. they all partook in that. the levels of professionalism, fitness, were no longer close to where it is now.</p>

<p>Jordan&rsquo;s differentiator was his incredible talent and he worked harder than the rest of the field. In the meantime, he had his pleasures of life. &ldquo;He did all that while he was buzzed out, smoking, playing golf&rdquo;- yeah so were the rest of the players. But Jordan worked very hard so you&rsquo;re trying to make him an accidental genius to elevate his legend.</p>

<p>secondly, even if he did all those things, it was easier to be great in that era while doing all those things because you still had that god-given talent, athleticism to stand out.</p>

<p>If Messi/Ronaldo/Lebron/Djokovic tried to smoke, play golf 3hrs before a game and came buzzed out today, they&rsquo;d get completely obliterated. It&rsquo;s no longer possible for worldclass talent to just wake up from bed and do their thing. the average Joe has narrowed that gap cutting out all those elements and dedicating their talents to maintaining elite level fitness.</p>

<p>the emphasis on a certain level of fitness in pro-sports has narrowed whatever gap there may have between players due to talent back in the day. the advancement of sports science, nutrition, fitness has levelled the playing field. careers have lengthened, the genetic pool has widened. the peak are much longer.</p>

<p>Doubt we&rsquo;ll ever see a duo that missed less games than Stockton+Malone. In 19 seasons, Stockton played every game 17 times, missed 4 one season and 18 in another. Malone played 18 seasons with Utah and missed 10 games TOTAL.</p>

That and a drastic increase in the presence of youth development leagues in college/NBA draft recruitment all mean that repetitive motion injuries now get started before players have even reached their teen years.

      <label for="ll3c4wp" class="commentText"><p>One reason Jordan was able to keep being effective even in his Wizards stint was that he wasn&rsquo;t leaping out the gym on every play. Sure, he was hustling on defense on every play and dominating on offense, but he wasn&rsquo;t making super hard cuts since those are the plays that wreck knees.</p>

      <label for="ll3b734" class="commentText"><p>I have a theory, backed up by absolutely 0 data, that I believe with my entire chest.</p>

<p>Load management leads to injuries. Between teams practicing way less, and players being extra cautious (I realize it’s mostly the organizations/training staff), they don’t get enough reps at game intensity. When they finally do get into a game, it’s such a shock to the system.</p>

<p>Obviously there are people - Kawhi comes to mind - who need load management. But I truly believe that lack of intense preparation is leading to an uptick in injuries, among other things.</p>

<p>Like, these are pro athletes. There’s no way that 20-30 minutes of basketball 3-4 times a week is too much stress on their bodies; 7’2 + people aside. I just refuse to believe it.</p>

<p>In Jordan&rsquo;s day, he was playing other sports (notably baseball) and guys didn&rsquo;t have an intense year-round hoop circuit they participated in (unlike now).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen several articles/studies on it (would provide links but on the road, just Google something like &ldquo;youth sports specialization injuries&rdquo;).</p>

And when they hit the majors, they’d throw 30 complete games and 300 innings a year for a couple decades. Now they throw five innings and hit the showers.</p>

      <label for="ll3df44" class="commentText"><p>The increase of perimeter play and wear on young athletes now is way more coming into the league. I saw something where some NBA trainers basically said due to AAU and HS play, a lot of HS prospects are coming into the league with a lot more injuries than they did before.</p>

<p>That, and while defense back then may have been more violent (harder fouls, more contact near the basket) the increase of running around the perimeter and more motion oriented offense vs. the slower iso offenses of the 80s and 90s result might have lead to an increase in lower leg injuries like ACL tears, Achilles, and so on.</p>

Well, amongst many, but that had to be have been really tough.  By far the weakest Bulls team but still carried them to 60 wins and once again elevated in the playoffs.  All while he was at the end of his prime too but he just decided that didn&rsquo;t matter</p>

<p>Got Rodman to focus and squeeze the last juice from his body.  Scottie&rsquo;s injury year and he was just pretty decent at best.  Shot pretty poorly in the playoffs.  Think Kukoc was just his normal 10-15 points</p>

      <label for="ll3c7er" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the average number of games played by the stars in the 90s is higher than today. Probably has to do with the faster pace, and the 3 point shot and the fact that there&rsquo;s so much more movement involved, like those quick stops and starts that wear on joints. 90s play was much slower and much more standing around than today (in general I mean, obv not for guys like Mike and Reggie)</p>
