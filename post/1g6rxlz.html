He has flaws like every good player and would be even better if Steve Kerr wasn&rsquo;t a terrible coach for young players taking away valuable development time to play guys like Anthony Lamb. Being asked to defend the best opposing player while also producing efficient offense is an achievement.</p>

<p>The biggest waste of money is that 100 million contract extension for a 35 year old Draymond who is an offensive liability against every good team and can&rsquo;t defend any position at an elite level.</p>

      <label for="lsl4fry" class="commentText"><p>His shortcomings are almost positionless.</p>

<p>He can be slightly lost at times at both ends of the court. Offensively, the motion offense isn‚Äôt easy for everyone, but defensively his lapses are frustrating. I‚Äôve seen him plenty of times in his career not looking for the pass as he jogs to the offensive side, just did it this preseason and barely caught the pass (but then turned it into a smooth finish at the rim)</p>

<p>His shooting from deep is much improved in the preseason, but it‚Äôs too small a sample set. That‚Äôs not just percentage, but the speed and confidence he shoots at. So hard to pen him in as a 3 just yet as they need floor spacing at the position.</p>

<p>He‚Äôs an inconsistent rebounder, which kills when he‚Äôs playing the 4.</p>

<p>He‚Äôs got all the physical tools to dominate and has shown flashes of overcoming his shortcomings regularly. They just really need to see it consistently. Lots of off-ball stuff to get better at.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lslyvxg" class="commentText"><p>While what you said is true, there‚Äôs some important missing information in the Kuminga equation.  When he‚Äôs locked in he is good at those things.  Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt know if he will ever be consistently locked in.  Also, locking in has no effect on his rotational defense, which is consistently poor.  He is slow to adjust, help, rotate, etc.  In the modern nba, team defense is more important than on ball defense.  Getting a contest off on a 3 is often the most important thing you can do as a defender on a possession.  He is almost always late on that contest.  Another huge issue is that he jumps out of his goddamn shoes every ball fake.  He gets lost in the air on even the laziest of shot pumps.  On the offensive side, his positioning is awful.  He is an excellent cutter, but if he doesn‚Äôt get a lob, he relocates pretty often to where someone else already is, or he just kind of stands around in the key.  I have heard people say his ballhandling has improved, but I think this is surface level.  Yes, he dribbles off his foot less.  But he is still unable to drive well with his left hand, he doesn‚Äôt have a good crossover, and if you combine footwork into this criticism he still has no real go to moves to bully a mismatch.  He does well at the 4 blowing by slower big men, but when a smaller point guard switches onto him he is often steered directly into help at the rim.  In fact, that‚Äôs kind of all he does.  He dives at the rim.  He gets away with it more than he should because of the gravity this team has to pull defenders away from the rim, but if you‚Äôre billing him as the star of the future he isn‚Äôt going to have that gravity to work with.  His mid range is bad, his 3 is inconsistent and is also dependent on getting wide open looks from the gravity of the real shooters.  All of this would be forgivable and workable into a possible larger role, but he cannot pass the ball worth a damn.  Dray and Steph make a pass when it is open, or sometimes even before it is open when they see a defender turn their head or in anticipation of a defender running into a screen.  Kuminga passes after they‚Äôre open, when the defense is already adjusting to be ready for it.  He doesn‚Äôt turn the ball over a ton, but he also does not progress the offense, force defensive rotations, or indeed put any pressure on the defense with it.  And that‚Äôs when he makes a pass at all, usually he just makes a reassuring head down rush for the rim.</p>

<p>All this is to say that Kuminga is not the guy for the future.  His athleticism is amazing, he‚Äôs young, but basketball requires more than those things.  The all time greats were all also great basketball minds who thought quickly and well.  Kuminga thinks and reacts slowly.  And while he can get used to what to do in situations as he becomes a veteran, he will always be reactive to situations at both ends of the floor.  He is, unfortunately, another guy in a long line of players the Warriors system and gravity of its shooters have made look better than they are.  Undersized shooter off the bench like Ian Clark or Quinn Cooke?  Sure, we can get you good looks against bench units or if Steph is in the game pulling extra defenders.  But they were next to worthless the second they left our team.  Jordan Poole looked like a future efficient <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> guy.  And he‚Äôs not unskilled.  But his dribble can‚Äôt keep up with his speed, so most of the time he is trying to beat actual defenders, he‚Äôs out of control, and he was never a very good shooter.  He did well on the Warriors because he wasn‚Äôt the defense‚Äôs focus.  With two defenders on Steph, Dray‚Äôs defender rolling with him to help on the Dray screen for Steph, Klay‚Äôs defender playing no help side, and the final defender on Wiggins, Poole was often wide open with a path to the rim to take advantage of his speed in a straight line before any help could collapse.  His 3 point shot was never consistent and his mid range wasn‚Äôt good.  Washington found out his limitations when not paired with guys like Curry to pull defenders and Dray to break down defenses with passing.  Kuminga is heavily dependent on Steph and Dray, and when they retire, everyone will act mystified as to why Kuminga isn‚Äôt taking over.  It‚Äôs because we ignored what is causing him to do well in the first place.  We fell into the same old trap of a player doing well in our system and because of Steph‚Äôs all time gravity.</p>

<p>Moody is not a star, but he is a much better fit for the modern nba and our system, and it is a crime that he wasn‚Äôt getting minutes while Wiggins had his talent stolen space jam style.  Moody has been ready to contribute in serious minutes since the beginning of his second season.  He is both smart and always locked in for maximum effort.  I really hope the Warriors make the correct decision and lock in Moody while he‚Äôs still a relatively cheap contract and let some other team fall into the trap of maxing Kuminga.</p>

      <label for="lslbasa" class="commentText"><p>Yes definitely. Hopefully I didn‚Äôt lose that aspect of JK in my post. That promise he shows is exciting. Is the reason they‚Äôre still putting in the effort. And it‚Äôs trending towards better, and we all hope it continues rather than plateauing</p>

<p>Hope I&rsquo;m proven wrong this season as I&rsquo;m a big warriors fan but I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>

      <label for="lslccx8" class="commentText"><p>Yea. When he‚Äôs playing POA defense, I use to give him a bit of a pass, bc he‚Äôs guarding on the perimeter, challenging the shot. But there‚Äôs too many times where he just stands in no mans land while ball watching.</p>

<p>Podz has shown me what a player looks like when they desire a rebound. Podz has shown a lot regarding desire and effort on a consistent basis. That‚Äôs really highlighted JK‚Äôs inconsistency.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a huge JK fan, but I can see the little things missed. If he‚Äôs not efficiently getting buckets, he‚Äôs not impacting the game in other ways despite all his physical gifts.</p>

      <label for="lsnb485" class="commentText"><p>Yes it‚Äôs wild. He doesn‚Äôt challenge at the rim much. It‚Äôs all defensive motor or defensive awareness. He‚Äôs fouled a lot on block attempts, and either he can‚Äôt figure out timing at the NBA level or just chooses to not care enough about the little things. He seems most consistently engaged when it comes to scoring. Maybe it‚Äôs preseason? But those are the type of things that‚Äôd lead him to getting less PT in the past. I wanted more JK minutes, but I could see how Kerr was trying to send a message.</p>

      <label for="lslpw9j" class="commentText"><p>all of this is on-target.</p>

<p>Kerr even addressed this in his most recent press conference re: positions. He said they are somewhat constrained by the Draymond + a non-stretch center reality they are facing, but added that a lot of this is about speed and effort. <em>If</em> Kuminga rebounds and runs and is a reliable defender (he doesn&rsquo;t even need to be excellent, just trustworthy), it turns the transition game into a real weapon and they can probably can play him with those guys.</p>

<p>if he can&rsquo;t, the half-court offense is pretty unworkable and the defense also suffers, which is just a losing proposition.</p>

He really is great at finishing, his midrange is surprisingly good, and there is hope for great 3pt shooting in a couple years bc he‚Äôs improved each season. He could be a true three level scorer. He puts together consistency on defense, he‚Äôs all star for sure.</p>

<p>Is the little things that contribute to winning basketball that makes me worry. He is totally capable of doing those things, but will he chose to?</p>

<p>JK has talent but he‚Äôs not as talented as a jaylen brown or pg13</p>

<p>offensively he can bully you if he‚Äôs more athletic than you. but put a smart team/defender or athletic dude on him then it‚Äôs gg.</p>

<p>he still has no counter moves and has no go to move other than the bull rush drives he does (which if you have a good defender like AD, you just keep a body on him and give him ground and he will fire an errant pass)</p>

<p>defensively he‚Äôs not the perimeter guy you hope he can be. still horrible on team defense and doesn‚Äôt have the feet to be a true POA defender like wiggins or a gp2.</p>

<p>right now if i had to make a comparison he‚Äôs a walmart corey maggette. he can score (against average or bad teams), he‚Äôs got one move (but it doesn‚Äôt work against good to great defenders), he‚Äôs got the size and physical tools to be a great defender (but he‚Äôs not).</p>

<p>he‚Äôs stuck in limbo as a potential empty stats guy.</p>

      <label for="lsmegxo" class="commentText"><p>I am a Kuminga skeptic. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s done nearly enough to justify the amount of hype he gets from a very vocal percentage of the Warrior&rsquo;s subreddit and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s done anything to justify a rookie max contract. Kuminga&rsquo;s game is way too one dimensional and his effort is way too inconsistent to be considered a future star. Dunk highlights don&rsquo;t mean shit if you&rsquo;re not contributing in a meaningful way to your team&rsquo;s success for the remaining 60-70% of your minutes.</p>

<p>I think it was very telling that Danny Ainge wanted Podz over Kuminga in the theoretical Markkanen trade. Danny is a gaping asshole of a human being, but he&rsquo;s not definitely not stupid. If Ainge thinks Kuminga ain&rsquo;t shit, then he probably ain&rsquo;t shit.</p>

<p>I can see Podz, Moody, and Jackson-Davis being the core of a next generation Warriors team, but Kuminga isn&rsquo;t going to be the centerpiece of that team.</p>

Every good to decent rookie wants the max and I just don&rsquo;t know how to feel about handing that out for a player who won&rsquo;t help a team over the hump. I don&rsquo;t want Kuminga to not get his money - but the team that could be assembled with him making a rookie max extension would be exponentially worse than if he didn&rsquo;t take the max.</p>

      <label for="lsl59d7" class="commentText"><p>Is Kuminga in the process of making himself the next Brandon Ingram contract-wise? He&rsquo;s good and he has some leverage but if he&rsquo;s not going to sign anything but a max I think he&rsquo;s going to be disappointed and probably cost himself money in the long run.</p>

<p>As soon he started to play extended minutes he averaged a very efficient 19/6/3 for a solid team as a 21 year old which is very impressive</p>

<p>It‚Äôs odd a team that‚Äôs clearly rebuilding would prefer a 28 year old over a known good young player</p>

      <label for="lsl4yxn" class="commentText"><p>The logic is interesting to me too. But the reality is at the core people just don&rsquo;t think that High of Kuminga&rsquo;s ceiling. It&rsquo;s so hard to properly project him while he&rsquo;s playing on the Warriors. He&rsquo;s been so restrained and restricted. By all accounts though he&rsquo;ll have a bigger role this year so we&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;m a believer personally.</p>
