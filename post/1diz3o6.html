<p>People who wanna bury Boston for not winning titles in previous seasons and saying they were underachieving are being silly. It&rsquo;s very hard to win in the NBA if your stars aren&rsquo;t in their prime and established. If anything the Celtics have been overachieving for awhile based on where their guys were at in the development cycle.</p>

<p>Just like Luka now, he’s a killa, but this year going to teach him something on what he needs to do to succeed. Maybe it’s staying composed as the leader so less whining (hopefully…), but more importantly taking his conditioning and defense more seriously.</p>

<p>Gotta fail before you succeed, and even as a Lakers fan, I gotta tip my hat to the success the Celtics have built.</p>

Everyone points to the fact that LeBron and MJ didn’t win their first titles til their late 20s. But when you got kids making playoff runs and Finals before 25 then they’re chokers and criticized when they don’t win it all.</p>

Now that he’s obviously solidified his legacy people point back to how long it took him to get the first, but at the time he was getting crucified, probably more than Tatum ever has. Hell, 2011 practically made neutral fans nut when he didn’t immediately win after forming a super team.</p>

<p>Love Luka for this reason. He acts &ldquo;humble&rdquo; but you know he really thinks he&rsquo;s the shit and shows that on the court. That&rsquo;s what the great ones do. That attitude is needed. So why make these kids lie about it to &ldquo;act humble.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a way to have high self belief and still be kind to others on/off the court.</p>

      <label for="l97crba" class="commentText"><p>To take it a step further - you pretty much <em>need</em> those failed runs to succeed in the NBA.  It takes experience to understand how to succeed in the postseason, how to pace yourself, how to step up to the required intensity and play within the very different environment, how to mentally lock in and focus at the end of a very long season.  There&rsquo;s a reason stars rarely win a ring before 27 or 28.</p>

<p>Celtics may not have won this title if not for 2022.  And they may not have made it to the Finals in 2022 if not for the tough ECF losses in 2018 and 2020.  It&rsquo;s all part of the process.</p>

<p>Now Luka knows what it&rsquo;s like to taste the Finals.  Minnesota and Indiana likely learned a ton and they&rsquo;ll be back and better for it.  Thunder got their first taste of the playoffs and they&rsquo;re a very young team but people will look back in a few years when they make the Finals at all the experience gained.</p>

      <label for="l97exx6" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. There were members of the media after we made the Finals saying Luka &ldquo;needed&rdquo; to achieve that to maintain his standing as a top player when he&rsquo;s literally younger than MJ and Lebron were when they won their 1st titles. I do think some criticism of the Celtics was warranted for the last couple of years, but that doesn&rsquo;t make Tatum or Brown disappointments.</p>

Just crazy lol, so many guys talk the talk of whatever it takes to win then when it comes time to sacrifice their roll or shots or stats and personal accolades they throw a fit, but this team just showed what that actually looks like, and they did it all season. Tatum went from top 3 MVP candidate after the all star break at one point last year to this year taking as much shit from the media and fans online as anybody through the playoffs all because he changed his style to play to win a title instead of playing to get 30+ ppg and a pointless regular season MVP award. Biggest game of his life last night and he showed out as the best player on the floor, dude can do it when he needs to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely true.  The deeper you go, the more scrutiny you face.  Luka&rsquo;s defense was on full display in the Finals and it definitely damaged his reputation in a lot of people&rsquo;s eyes.  Even if he were to eventually win titles, they&rsquo;ll act like this loss is a stain on his record in the same way they act like Jordan&rsquo;s 6-0, while also having multiple seasons with a losing record and missing the finals, is more impressive than someone like LeBron making the Finals 10 times in a much deeper and competitive league.   For the guys who havent&rsquo; accomplished jack shit like SGA, they get to just keep their reputation intact.   For the winners like Tatum and Brown, they get knocked for only coming close.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You think its weird to say that a 6-0 record is more impressive than 4-6? Either way,  judging them as players based on finals record is obviously stupid. There is tons of context that explains both of those records that goes beyond their impact as players.</p>

<p>For example, Jordan doesn&rsquo;t have a perfect finals record if he has to play a KD Warriors level team there. Just like Lebron is not making 10 finals if he has a Larry Bird Celtics or Bad Boy Pistons level team in his own conference.</p>

<p>Winning heals everything though, both of them were labeled as players who couldn&rsquo;t win until they did. Same with Giannis recently. Luka will go through this as well until he wins.</p>

For example: Tim Duncan, the greatest PF of all time and a certified top 10 player, was part of a Spurs team got destroyed by the Lakers in 2 consecutive playoffs during his prime and was part of a 61-win Spurs team that lost to the 8th seeded Grizzlies in 2011.</p>

<p>But since none of that happened in the Finals, it&rsquo;s never mentioned&hellip;because for some reason, people rightfully give Duncan the benefit of the doubt and know he&rsquo;s awesome no matter what. Probably because people like him as a person.</p>

<p>Yet people <em>still</em> mention Bron&rsquo;s 2011 Finals.</p>

      <label for="l97oixe" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. That’s why people were so critical on them. They were a contending team every season, even during Tatum’s rookie year. He was expected to lead the team along with Brown, and with every failure, even Celtics were starting to wonder if one of them had to go.</p>

<p>Hasn’t anyone ever explained to these people that being criticized- fairly AND unfairly- is part of why they make so damn much money to begin with?</p>

<p>Listen, the whole reason you get paid $200 million is because the money making engine works via engagement at every level, and THE CRITICISM is part of the money making model.</p>

<p>If people were politely respectful and relatively ambivalent, they wouldn’t pay all the money to consume your product, or spend time listening/reacting to criticism.</p>

<p>And you wouldn’t get your $200 million contract.</p>

On top of that people treat Tatum, one of the most un-controversial stars as some asshole.</p>

<p>These two, especially tatum, get more undeserved hate than anyone I can recently remember.</p>
