<p>People who wanna bury Boston for not winning titles in previous seasons and saying they were underachieving are being silly. It&rsquo;s very hard to win in the NBA if your stars aren&rsquo;t in their prime and established. If anything the Celtics have been overachieving for awhile based on where their guys were at in the development cycle.</p>

Even at that stage of his career, he made the defense adjust in ways that most players can&rsquo;t. Wade definitely benefitted from that space. Whereas LeBron and MJ never had a player like that early in their careers.</p>

<p>With that said, that team was great and Wade was spectacular.</p>

      <label for="l97qoch" class="commentText"><p>People were really saying that the celtics were chokers forever, but they really forgetting that it takes time and failures to succeed. Losing against Golden State must have taught them so much.</p>

<p>Just like Luka now, he’s a killa, but this year going to teach him something on what he needs to do to succeed. Maybe it’s staying composed as the leader so less whining (hopefully…), but more importantly taking his conditioning and defense more seriously.</p>

<p>Gotta fail before you succeed, and even as a Lakers fan, I gotta tip my hat to the success the Celtics have built.</p>

<p>But I agree. I can see him going &ldquo;well I was hurt. Things would&rsquo;ve been different&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Luka will never be a <em>good</em> defender, but slim Luka could at least be <em>serviceable</em>. And that&rsquo;s what they need from him at the very least.</p>

<p>Dirk is a great example of what I&rsquo;d want out of Luka. &ldquo;yes, you are an offensive player. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re paying you for. But you need to be respectable on defense too&rdquo;. Dirk was never going to win a DPOY but you could also create a 5-man defensive game plan with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I was hurt [or] how much I was hurt. I was out there, trying to play. But I didn&rsquo;t do enough.”</p>

<p>And for the record, I think you&rsquo;re right on your points, I just thought it was worth pointing out his comments because how prevalent it is for a star to make the injury excuse (i.e. Lebron&rsquo;s hand after the 2018 finals)</p>

      <label for="l983u05" class="commentText"><p>Sure. I think he can say that he&rsquo;s hurt and say he should&rsquo;ve played better, without taking any meaningful steps to solve his conditioning, which arguably effected him way more than any injury.</p>

<p>Tatum said the same thing after 2022. We all knew his shoulder was banged up, but then it came out afterwards that he also had a piece of his wrist broken.</p>

      <label for="l981ach" class="commentText"><p>The main difference is the teams situations when they joined, Tatum joined a team that had been in the eastern conference finals the previous year, they’ve always been considered contenders when he’s been there so he’s had more legitimate chances than those guys did. The Celtics got that pick because they fleeced the Nets not because they were actually bad. Brown was drafted to the Celtics who made the playoffs the year before, and he didn’t become a star until later when they were contenders every year.</p>

Lebron, Giannis, Jokic and Curry were not drafted in those situations. JTs rookie season they were in the ECF. People got to know him immediately off that and being the 3rd overall pick and immediately made their minds up about him, me included. I still don’t think he or Brown are what Celtics fans think they are, but it doesn’t matter because they won the chip.</p>

      <label for="l97u4d8" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s a reason for that in the NFL when it comes to quarterbacks. The last quarterback to lose the first Super Bowl they started in and then eventually win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback was John Elway in 1997. So many times you&rsquo;ll see a young team lose a close Super Bowl, and people say &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; but the reality is that they likely won&rsquo;t get that opportunity again. Then every future playoff loss hurts just a little bit more than it did the previous year because you start to feel like your window is closing, or has already closed.</p>

<p>Sure, this is all circumstantial and could change this year with the Bengals or 49ers, but that feeling of &ldquo;we were so close&rdquo; just looms so hard as the years dwindle on.</p>

<p>And also he’d been just about a decade out from those Superbowls, he was rumored to be retiring etc.</p>

<p>What really sent him into the GOAT stratosphere was his 2014 and 2017 wins. Then 2020 solidified it.</p>

<p>Imagine if Russell Wilson came back to win three more rings by the end of this decade. That’s essentially the same passage of time between Brady’s first SBs and his later run.</p>

<p>Montana had a very solid argument against a 3-2 Brady.</p>

Matter of fact, I believe one of them would have been traded by now if that was the case. Making it to the finals against GSW obviously showed that something was working.</p>

<p>Love Luka for this reason. He acts &ldquo;humble&rdquo; but you know he really thinks he&rsquo;s the shit and shows that on the court. That&rsquo;s what the great ones do. That attitude is needed. So why make these kids lie about it to &ldquo;act humble.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a way to have high self belief and still be kind to others on/off the court.</p>

      <label for="l97crba" class="commentText"><p>To take it a step further - you pretty much <em>need</em> those failed runs to succeed in the NBA.  It takes experience to understand how to succeed in the postseason, how to pace yourself, how to step up to the required intensity and play within the very different environment, how to mentally lock in and focus at the end of a very long season.  There&rsquo;s a reason stars rarely win a ring before 27 or 28.</p>

<p>Celtics may not have won this title if not for 2022.  And they may not have made it to the Finals in 2022 if not for the tough ECF losses in 2018 and 2020.  It&rsquo;s all part of the process.</p>

<p>Now Luka knows what it&rsquo;s like to taste the Finals.  Minnesota and Indiana likely learned a ton and they&rsquo;ll be back and better for it.  Thunder got their first taste of the playoffs and they&rsquo;re a very young team but people will look back in a few years when they make the Finals at all the experience gained.</p>

<p>Weren&rsquo;t people saying this about the Pacers back when the Heat would knock them out each year? And wasn&rsquo;t that a MUCH better Pacers team than the one last year? I don&rsquo;t think we will see this iteration of the Pacers win a championship, unless they draft Bronny James or something.</p>

<p>And Minnesota will probably continue to do very well for several seasons to come with championship aspirations, but lose in devastating fashion in the playoffs, because that&rsquo;s how Minnesota sports go.</p>

      <label for="l97exx6" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. There were members of the media after we made the Finals saying Luka &ldquo;needed&rdquo; to achieve that to maintain his standing as a top player when he&rsquo;s literally younger than MJ and Lebron were when they won their 1st titles. I do think some criticism of the Celtics was warranted for the last couple of years, but that doesn&rsquo;t make Tatum or Brown disappointments.</p>

Just crazy lol, so many guys talk the talk of whatever it takes to win then when it comes time to sacrifice their roll or shots or stats and personal accolades they throw a fit, but this team just showed what that actually looks like, and they did it all season. Tatum went from top 3 MVP candidate after the all star break at one point last year to this year taking as much shit from the media and fans online as anybody through the playoffs all because he changed his style to play to win a title instead of playing to get 30+ ppg and a pointless regular season MVP award. Biggest game of his life last night and he showed out as the best player on the floor, dude can do it when he needs to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely true.  The deeper you go, the more scrutiny you face.  Luka&rsquo;s defense was on full display in the Finals and it definitely damaged his reputation in a lot of people&rsquo;s eyes.  Even if he were to eventually win titles, they&rsquo;ll act like this loss is a stain on his record in the same way they act like Jordan&rsquo;s 6-0, while also having multiple seasons with a losing record and missing the finals, is more impressive than someone like LeBron making the Finals 10 times in a much deeper and competitive league.   For the guys who havent&rsquo; accomplished jack shit like SGA, they get to just keep their reputation intact.   For the winners like Tatum and Brown, they get knocked for only coming close.</p>

      <label for="l97jdru" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really weird and I don&rsquo;t understand why that is. For example: Tim Duncan, the greatest PF of all time and a certified top 10 player, was part of a Spurs team got destroyed by the Lakers in 2 consecutive playoffs during his prime and was part of a 61-win Spurs team that lost to the 8th seeded Grizzlies in 2011.</p>

<p>But since none of that happened in the Finals, it&rsquo;s never mentioned&hellip;because for some reason, people rightfully give Duncan the benefit of the doubt and know he&rsquo;s awesome no matter what. Probably because people like him as a person.</p>

<p>Yet people <em>still</em> mention Bron&rsquo;s 2011 Finals.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You think its weird to say that a 6-0 record is more impressive than 4-6? Either way,  judging them as players based on finals record is obviously stupid. There is tons of context that explains both of those records that goes beyond their impact as players.</p>

<p>For example, Jordan doesn&rsquo;t have a perfect finals record if he has to play a KD Warriors level team there. Just like Lebron is not making 10 finals if he has a Larry Bird Celtics or Bad Boy Pistons level team in his own conference.</p>

<p>Winning heals everything though, both of them were labeled as players who couldn&rsquo;t win until they did. Same with Giannis recently. Luka will go through this as well until he wins.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but there&rsquo;s no way anyone would actually say this, unless they were trying to defend Aaron Rodgers because they like what he says when he&rsquo;s not talking about football. Rodgers is one of the best QBs ever, but Brady is undoubtedly the GOAT.</p>

      <label for="l97tfak" class="commentText"><p>this narrative of the celtics overcoming the odds and a ton of doubters is already getting old. this is the most decorated team in the sport and they have had an absolutely loaded roster for years. they have had bad playoff losses and a lot of the backlash they have gotten has been warranted. this season they had the deepest and most talented team in the league and coasted to 64 wins in an easy conference.</p>

<p>every team has doubters because NBA fans are inherently negative and do everything they can to discredit successful teams, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the team/media/fans need to play into it. every team gets shit on relentlessly when they lose, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean this team overcame the odds. just enjoy the title.</p>

<p>Hasn’t anyone ever explained to these people that being criticized- fairly AND unfairly- is part of why they make so damn much money to begin with?</p>

<p>Listen, the whole reason you get paid $200 million is because the money making engine works via engagement at every level, and THE CRITICISM is part of the money making model.</p>

<p>If people were politely respectful and relatively ambivalent, they wouldn’t pay all the money to consume your product, or spend time listening/reacting to criticism.</p>

<p>And you wouldn’t get your $200 million contract.</p>

<p>These two, especially tatum, get more undeserved hate than anyone I can recently remember.</p>
