      <p>I‚Äôve noticed on the likes of twitter, instagram, tiktok and other social medias that fans, and haters, will often use the term ‚Äúrole player‚Äù as an insult.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt really understand why as to play your role, to pull your weight, is an expectation and shows the qualities of a good teammate.</p>

<p>So that‚Äôs why I gotta ask, do you consider ‚Äúrole player‚Äù an insult? and if so, why?</p>

He personally saved a ring for himself and the Heatles, and it&rsquo;s a huge legacy booster for him.

<p>But let‚Äôs be real, to be a ‚Äúrole player‚Äù you have to play long enough to earn a role - so we‚Äôre talking 8-12 seasons, playing 50 or so games a season (maybe more). If I look at players who were in the draft class I would have gone in (in this imaginary world where I play 4 years of college and then become a ‚Äúrole player‚Äù), then we‚Äôve got players like Jamaal Tinsley, Trenton Hassell, Bobby Simmons and Earl Watkins. They earned $29-50m each in their career. I‚Äôd be happy to take my money &amp; fade into the sunset with a ‚Äúrole player‚Äù label üòÇ</p>

      <label for="lm8wr4r" class="commentText"><p>Broadly, I&rsquo;d say it depends on the length of the career. Five or fewer makes me think they never really got to show off their talent, or it wasn&rsquo;t enough to stay in the league. Ten or more? That there is a pro who found a way to make it work and stay in the NBA in a relevant (at least to their team) manner.<br>
  I think of another term occasionally tossed around - Journeyman - where if you just get bounced around for a few years and are out, it hits way different than say, an Ish Smith, who should only rent whenever a team signs him, but he keeps getting signed, and that&rsquo;s gotta mean something.</p>

We have seen so many champions in a row fall apart not because they lost stars, but because they lost key role players they simply couldnt replace.</p>

<p>outside of the pay difference, id much rather be a really good role player like a KCP or alex caruso than one of those guys in &ldquo;star purgatory&rdquo; a la zach lavine or miles bridges or dejounte murray or CJ McCollum whatever where youre never going to be able to make work on a great team.</p>

Those 3 you mentioned (fuck Miles Bridges) are all in the elite level in terms of being role players, but they aren&rsquo;t players that you build your system around, they aren&rsquo;t players you build your championship team around, they are complimentary pieces, which in my opinion, makes them role players</p>

Bulls thought he could take the next step to superstar so they tried building around him. But if i shove a square into a circle, is it now a circle? No. It&rsquo;s still a square, just in the wrong place. You have such a negative bias towards what a role player is that you can&rsquo;t stop and think for 2 seconds</p>

      <label for="lm91jyi" class="commentText"><p>It is my biased personal opinion, but in a team sport, give me the career of Draymond or Klay above Melo&rsquo;s. I prefer to be considered a 3&amp;D or a defensive anchor/kicker in the nuts while winning a lot, than to score 25 every night and have a disappointing career (in part because of me)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even understand how it could be other way. Even if you say Lillard instead. I don&rsquo;t get how people say give me the money when someone makes 180M but the other makes 300M. It&rsquo;s a lot of money but looking into the dumb things players waste it, I think I could bear to earn &ldquo;only&rdquo; 180M. I don&rsquo;t get what you cam do with 300M that you can&rsquo;t with 180M.</p>

<p>In a team sport you want to go home after every game having won the game or the series or at least be competitive. In the 2nd place evidently I want to contribute positively.
But going home after losing even if you score 35, that feeling must be sour.</p>

<p>Give me a role player&rsquo;s career if he won and didn&rsquo;t even make the all star like Derek Fisher or Michael Cooper.</p>

      <label for="lm93upr" class="commentText"><p>God no. In the league, there are roughly 5-15 guys who are worthy of the title &ldquo;Superstar&rdquo; and legitimately everyone else is a role player. You can be an elite role player. There are tiers to it. But unless you&rsquo;re the superstar getting championship teams built around you, you are a guy who is meant to fill a role. Prime Klay was a role player. Scottie was a elite role player. Those are some of the more major examples. Being a complimentary piece isn&rsquo;t a bad thing at all, it&rsquo;s just a lack of perspective from players and a lack of respect from fans that causes the disconnect</p>

<p>So below that, you have maybe the occasional All star nominee players that might be considered above it. But being a roleplayer is by no means an insult in my book.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre talking about players that are good enough to be considered key contributors in a championship team. In the best and highest level league of the world.</p>

<p>Then it depends. I‚Äôm sure Beal or Poole would be pissed to be called and considered a Role player. Someone like Caleb Martin would probably not be offended being considered a Role player.</p>

      <label for="lm8x04j" class="commentText"><p>dennis rodman had a lot going on for him off the court too tho which is why he&rsquo;s a lot more famous compared to normal role players like if you ask anyone if they would rather have steve kerrs career or carmelo anthonys/chris paul pretty much everyone would choose the later</p>
