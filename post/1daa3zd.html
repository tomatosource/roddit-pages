      <label for="l7j4ia5" class="commentText"><p>Yep, it&rsquo;s not even the blowbys. It&rsquo;s how they help and do secondary rotations.</p>

<p>Part of it is Luka being lazy. Part of it though might be bad habits from other series where they just chill in the paint if they get beat off the dribble. </p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t do that against the Celtics. Shocking to see when it seemed like all the Eastern Conference teams they faced knew this to a T.</p>

He’s been injured for a lot of the playoffs, and he’s had some pretty grueling series. The Mavs also have a very heliocentric offense so Luka’s just having to do so much on every offensive possession.</p>

      <label for="l7kir9c" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve posted a lot about Tatum&rsquo;s exhaustion in 2022.  He also played the most minutes on the Olympic team in 2021, and was something like 5th most in minutes in the 20-21 season.</p>

<p>By the end of the 2021-22 season, Jayson Tatum had played more minutes of competitive basketball than just about anyone on the planet.</p>

<p>Edit: part of that total was the playoff runs &hellip; Jayson Tatum essentially played high level basketball from October of 2020 straight through to June of 2022.  And as one of the focal points on the court for all of those minutes.  Just an ungodly level of usage.</p>

      <label for="l7jhp4k" class="commentText"><p>No bro he’s lazy. He does this year after year playoffs or regular season. He’s just a bad defender. A lot of it is effort. Or a supreme lack thereof. Lazy closeouts( if he closes out at all). Poor foot speed at the point of attack it’s almost like he gives up.</p>

<p>This isn’t something new to this series. The Timberwolves ( because the coaching staff doesn’t want to win or whatever) didn’t bring Luka into the pick and roll at all last series. He was stuck on McDaniels in the corner and was allowed to take defensive plays off.</p>

<p>The Celtics have shooting at all 5 positions. Luka is a cone. They need to pre switch to get him out of there because this is year five. He’s not gonna improve at this point THIS late in the season</p>

If he&rsquo;s playing max effort physical defense (that he has the skillset to do), he <em>will</em> get gassed and be unable to contribute on offense.  Last night, the Celtics big runs usually started right before Luka got swapped out, because he was getting gassed.</p>

      <label for="l7j5t4l" class="commentText"><p>He’s absolutely got to get better at rotating to the shooter for sure. That’s always been a disappointing flaw in his game on the defensive side, because it’s just a matter of awareness and effort. I will point out though, not all of these were “blow by’s”. Luka doesn’t have the lateral footspeed to stay in front of a downhill attacker for long, so part of the defensive plan is to filter to the baseline and shotblocker/help defender. That’s what he did on a number of these plays.</p>

<p>The JBrown dunk and Jrue drive were absolute blow by’s though. The last play he was mostly beat, but then fully gambled and attempted the reach in, which didn’t end well.</p>

      <label for="l7jdfje" class="commentText"><p>The problem is that against the Celtics they don’t really care if you’re filtering to a big. If they get their shoulders past you they can score on that big or force a foul unless the guy who got blown by provides back pressure. If you provide back pressure it means someone is open on the perimeter and they’ll find them for an easy 3.</p>

<p>Against the Celtics you really need to keep guys in front of you, and the man defender along with help defenders need to have active hands to disrupt driving lanes. If you can do that the Celtics will struggle to finish inside and be forced to rely more on midrange looks or kicking the ball around the perimeter and taking a contested 3. KP definitely makes that a lot harder though, because that kind of focus on preventing penetration means switching everything, and that opens him up to attack guards in the post.</p>

      <label for="l7jqz9q" class="commentText"><p>It’s an excuse Mavs fans use every time they lose in the playoffs.  Jaylen Brown does it well on both ends.</p>

<p>People act like Luka expends so much effort on offense, lol.  Like he’s Steph Curry, constantly in motion every second on offense or something.</p>

      <label for="l7l0wk2" class="commentText"><p>He doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere near Curry&rsquo;s conditioning and running PnRs and isoing absolutely expends a ton of energy. He&rsquo;s like Rockets Harden. Comparing it to JB is flawed. Luka unequivocally does more on offense. Also, JB is one of the most in shape players in the league.</p>

<p>Luka absolutely needs to work on his conditioning if he wants to win.</p>

<p>LeBron was able to do it on both ends at his peak while shouldering a huge load on offense but he&rsquo;s also maybe the greatest athletes ever</p>

He was gassed at times in that game. I think it was the first quarter where he had that wide open corner three and missed it horribly. He waved to the bench for a sub afterwards.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s so good offensively, and he&rsquo;s a decent one on one defender, so most of the time he can get away with it. Maybe he still can against Boston. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

      <label for="l7jg1g6" class="commentText"><p>I hate criticizing incredible players. Luka is a killer and is unstoppable offensively. He&rsquo;s a fierce competitor. He&rsquo;s not afraid of anyone or anything.</p>

<p>But I do think there&rsquo;s a level of commitment that the greatest of the great players have that he doesn&rsquo;t. LeBron, Curry, Jordan, Kobe&hellip; I&rsquo;m just naming the first few I thought of, but those guys put so much effort into their training and conditioning because they didn&rsquo;t want anyone having ANY kind of edge on them. No one was going to be in better shape. No one was going to outwork them.</p>

<p>Luka wants to destroy everyone he faces, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to really get up for the competition until they&rsquo;re right in front of him. The greatest of the greats are competing even when no one else is around.</p>

There was an interview a year or two ago where he talked about one of the biggest lessons he learned from Kobe was that if you want to win a Championship you have to &ldquo;be about it&rdquo; in every aspect of your life.  It has to be a driver in what you eat, what you do in your downtime, what you do in the offseason, etc.</p>

      <label for="l7jl93q" class="commentText"><p>I do think that some players are so good that they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to do that.</p>

<p>Shaq wasn&rsquo;t about winning basketball games 100% of the time. That&rsquo;s famously what frustrated Kobe about him.</p>

<p>By all accounts, Jokic isn&rsquo;t living his life thinking only about winning championships.</p>

<p>I do think that Luka is so good that he could win a championship without ever truly taking his conditioning seriously. He might even do it this series.</p>

<p>But if you want to maximize your ability, you can&rsquo;t do that without fully committing.</p>

His commitment to being in better shape directly led to him winning 3 MVPs and a championship lol.</p>

He certainly is, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play the minutes he does at the level he does if he wasn&rsquo;t. But like&hellip; he just looks like this kinda skinny-fat pasty white guy. Compare him to any of those other guys that were mentioned, or like 98% of other pro athletes for that matter, and he looks like he&rsquo;s not even close in terms of overall physical fitness and athleticism.</p>

<p>Another part is that in the offseason he just kinda goes home and goofs off to a degree. He probably still maintains some type of diet and training regimen but he&rsquo;s certainly not like Curry or LeBron who are famous for their insane year-round training gauntlets.</p>

      <label for="l7jkrl6" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s funny how much he sometimes looks like Harden as a defender, in both a good and bad way. He&rsquo;s strong, and he&rsquo;s not going to get overpowered the way Tatum often overpowers smaller guards. When he isn&rsquo;t carrying the entire Mavs offense, he can move his feet decently well and work well in the Mavs system. But he (quite understandably, as with Harden) runs out of gas sometimes due to what he&rsquo;s asked to do on the other end, and when he&rsquo;s exhausted he can&rsquo;t contribute defensively on or off ball in the way that bigs can.</p>

<p>I wonder how much of it is also mental: he&rsquo;s such a chess master on the offensive end, and some of these lapses seem more about focus than physical exhaustion. Leaving Tatum wide-open from 3 when he had a lot of time to close out is a lot worse than giving Brown insufficient resistance on a drive.</p>

<p>LeBron is really good at getting the best bang for his buck defensively at this point, and while that&rsquo;s an unfair comparison I do wonder if an older Luka might be able to end up as a solid plus defender on a team where he&rsquo;s not The Guy Who Dribbles and he&rsquo;s able to apply more of his basketball savvy defensively.</p>

      <label for="l7kdice" class="commentText"><p>Honestly the number of guys in the NBA that can carry his offensive load and still fly around on defense and also not be totally cooked by the 4th is basically zero.</p>

<p>Even Westbrook who might have the best motor of any player I’ve ever seen was guilty of the same energy saving tactics on defense</p>

      <label for="l7l8fw6" class="commentText"><p>Yeah when he played against us, he just played the far side under the hoop right next to the paint. We just let it happen too and our ball movement sucked. It&rsquo;s interesting to see Luka even try to guard the perimeter in these clips. He definitely didn&rsquo;t in our series. Ant and KAT both didn&rsquo;t drive enough AND also didn&rsquo;t pass the ball enough. We let Luka just sit and hang out.</p>

      <label for="l7kf45l" class="commentText"><p>The real answer is that despite the seemingly difficult run the Mavs had if you look at the records of their opponents, they really didn&rsquo;t have to try that hard on defense. They only had to guard one guy in each series. Kawhi got hurt, Jdub and Chet looked like guys in their first playoffs, and KAT shot like <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> from 3. Sure the Mavs get some credit for forcing those performances, but it still made them seem better than they are on that end.</p>

But overall he falls asleep too much off ball and is just too slow on the perimeter. I will say I think this is the best defense of his career. But he will get picked on relentlessly if not for him being one of the weaker defenders in the lineup, for him to tire out on the other end.</p>

Very strong and hard to push around, but his lateral quickness is lacking (prone to getting blown by) and he falls asleep off-ball quite a bit.</p>

<p>Both of them have been a lot better defensively in the postseason compared to the regular season.  With Harden, that&rsquo;s been the case for quite a few years now too.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Offensively too lol. Stepback 3s, elite passing with lobs/bounce pass/wraparound to bigs, kickouts to the corners, and downcourt outlets off rebounds. Not particularly fast or high-jumping, but elite decel and body control. Known for foul-baiting and embellishing contact, some would say jumping into/onto defenders. Only diff is Luka has more of a post/back to the basket game while Harden more relies on the floater when they&rsquo;re in/around the paint but not getting all the way to the goal.</p>

<p>It’s a testament to the type of player he is that he still put up the shooting numbers he did. But if Dallas does end up losing this series, it’s gunna have to be a wake up call that Luka <em>really</em> needs to start focusing on his conditioning as a true point of emphasis.</p>

<p>That’s more effective than he used to be, but it’s really just staying with the offensive player for one turn, going for the steal, and fucking off for the possession if he doesn’t get it most of the time</p>

      <label for="l7iwvpa" class="commentText"><p>At least people don’t downvote when a Celtics fan says it. I’ll add on actual analysis here then. I think his rotations after getting blown by were the much bigger issue. Hes not gonna lock anyone down every time but when he does lose he has to rotate out. In other series like OKC he had done a better job of that but they also had one non shooter often out there.</p>

<p>End of the day, after the first quarter barrage, the Mavs defense held up pretty well. 26, 23, and 21 points in the next 3 quarters. The offense is by far the bigger issue. Role players besides PJ cannot do anything when they have Jrue or White on them and KP at the rim. DJJ/Green need to challenge KP less and keep the ball moving after attacking more.</p>

<p>I don’t think ball movement issues were just on Luka/Kyrie but role guys as well.</p>

      <label for="l7izd6k" class="commentText"><p>This was honestly a poor defensive performance from Dallas as a collective, even watching these clips there’s a few plays where JB takes the inside shot but there’s still options on the perimeter as well, for example on the JB dunk not only does he have a relatively open lane to the hoop but 40% shooters Al Horford and Sam Hauser were both wide open.</p>

<p>This next game I guarantee Dallas will tighten shit up and Boston’s decision making on those drives will matter more, last night it felt like whatever option they took would work, but imo Dallas will commit harder to either blocking the kick out or the drive next game and JB/Tatum will have to continue to make the right decision every single time</p>

Id be more worried about offense if I were a Mavs fan. The role players all got locked up, the lobs just weren&rsquo;t there against Porzingis and if Kyrie keeps shitting himself its going to be a short series.</p>

      <label for="l7j2lvp" class="commentText"><p>This compilation doesn&rsquo;t show it, but Luka actually did a decent job on defense for good stretches of the game. I&rsquo;ll be honest, Luka&rsquo;s gotten better on defense than I thought he had. He&rsquo;s still far from a lockdown defender, but he&rsquo;s a solid, serviceable defender now which is a great improvement from where he was a few years ago. Although Luka&rsquo;s decent, even a good defender on occasion now, I like Boston&rsquo;s strat of running it at him, even if only to tire him out some and(hopefully) reduce his production on the offensive end.</p>

      <label for="l7jk5ft" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Luka is the epitome of an average defender. He has good size, isn&rsquo;t the fastest (but it&rsquo;s not like he guards small guards often), plays pretty solid on ball but has shown to be poor off the ball at times. I feel like it may be  in part from carrying the Mavs offense, but he looked a bit tired after coming off a long break.</p>

<p>Even crazier that the Timberwolves coaching staff didn’t involve Luka in the pick and rolls. Professional coaches “scheming” to have Ant and KAT attack DJJ and Pj Washington instead of Doncic….. anyways.</p>

<p>Good on the Celtics for not being idiots</p>

But this is probably the Celtics plan for the whole series, hunt him on defense to make him expend more energy, and we saw his efficiency on offense wasn’t good. They’re gonna try to make him give an effort on both sides of the ball</p>

<p>Mavs just don&rsquo;t have the horsepower on defense to stop the Celtics.  It&rsquo;s the entire problem with a Luka-Kyrie backcourt - you can maybe get away with one of them, but not two against a pair of wings like the Jays.</p>

      <label for="l7jb3do" class="commentText"><p>Honestly the thing that surprises me the most is how often JB could give whoever is standing in the dunkers spot the easiest layup of their lives and he instead tries to draw the foul or tries to dunk with two people trying to contest. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that guy is standing right there specifically for the scenario where his defender decides to help defend whoever is driving to the basket and leaves him open for the free layup/dunk. Someone is there and open in almost every clip</p>

<p>You see an example with Jrue to White but that could&rsquo;ve happened <em>a lot</em> more</p>

      <label for="l7jdg10" class="commentText"><p>Yes JB&rsquo;s not a good playmaker. It&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s the ideal 2 and not 1.</p>

<p>Though I will say there is something good in just putting your head down and getting to the cup no matter what. Some times players get tripped up with having options. It&rsquo;s a whole nother skill to drive and be able to decide whether to shoot or pass in a split second.</p>

      <label for="l7jeyqy" class="commentText"><p>This was actually a great coaching job by the Celtics staff!! It is not just that they targeted Luka because everyone tries to but rather how they did it, well they have two great offensive talent which make sit harder to hide Luka. The point is they set it up so that even if he rotates he ends up on Tatum which would be another blow by which will put more pressure on their bigs. These clips of Luka not rotating are misleading as well. The first is later in the game when Luka knows what is going to happen and that him rotating is not going to stop it lol.</p>
