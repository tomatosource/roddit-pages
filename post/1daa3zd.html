      <label for="l7jrd8q" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, in addition to the athletic traits like lateral quickness and hand-eye, there&rsquo;s a huge component of defense that&rsquo;s commitment, willpower, cardio, focus (edit: also research, watching film and studying is a choice).  It&rsquo;s a lot of stuff you can just choose to do, technically, but being the kind of person who will make that choice is kind of as noteworthy as being 7&rsquo;3&rdquo;.</p>

Brilliant player, one of the best in the league, but for me the damage he did to his team on the defensive side of the ball just wasn&rsquo;t being properly baked into the MVP conversation. He deserved to be in the discussion but, for me, not to win it.</p>

But overall he falls asleep too much off ball and is just too slow on the perimeter. I will say I think this is the best defense of his career. But he will get picked on relentlessly if not for him being one of the weaker defenders in the lineup, for him to tire out on the other end.</p>

      <label for="l7j5ste" class="commentText"><p>People reject the comparison a lot, probably because they don&rsquo;t like Harden, but he has a lot of the same strengths and downsides as Harden defensively.  Very strong and hard to push around, but his lateral quickness is lacking (prone to getting blown by) and he falls asleep off-ball quite a bit.</p>

<p>Both of them have been a lot better defensively in the postseason compared to the regular season.  With Harden, that&rsquo;s been the case for quite a few years now too.</p>

<p>Tbh a lot of players statistically aren’t (unless you’re like Embiid or Jokic)</p>

<p>Post play is an inefficient form to generate offense and the league has moved away from it for the most part</p>

      <label for="l7jpcl4" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d argue during that time frame in the 2018 series,  post play was one of Kat&rsquo;s strongest strengths.  I&rsquo;d have to double check the numbers tho.</p>

<p>His effectiveness in the post has waned over time.  Especially due to doubles and the application of a strong wing as his primary defender with the teams main centre in a lurking help role.</p>

<p>Edit:  For the 2018 reg season,   With a minimum of 4 possessions,  Kat had the highest ppp at 1.02 and was highest percentile player at 85.8.</p>

<p>So he was extremely effective in the post in that time frame.</p>

<p>Part of it is Luka being lazy. Part of it though might be bad habits from other series where they just chill in the paint if they get beat off the dribble. </p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t do that against the Celtics. Shocking to see when it seemed like all the Eastern Conference teams they faced knew this to a T.</p>

      <label for="l7jhp4k" class="commentText"><p>No bro he’s lazy. He does this year after year playoffs or regular season. He’s just a bad defender. A lot of it is effort. Or a supreme lack thereof. Lazy closeouts( if he closes out at all). Poor foot speed at the point of attack it’s almost like he gives up.</p>

<p>This isn’t something new to this series. The Timberwolves ( because the coaching staff doesn’t want to win or whatever) didn’t bring Luka into the lock and roll at all last series. He was stuck on McDaniels in the corner and was allowed to take defensive plays off.</p>

<p>The Celtics have shooting at all 5 positions. Luka is a cone. They need to pre switch to get him out of there because this is year five. He’s not gonna improve at this point THIS late in the season</p>

      <label for="l7j5t4l" class="commentText"><p>He’s absolutely got to get better at rotating to the shooter for sure. That’s always been a disappointing flaw in his game on the defensive side, because it’s just a matter of awareness and effort. I will point out though, not all of these were “blow by’s”. Luka doesn’t have the lateral footspeed to stay in front of a downhill attacker for long, so part of the defensive plan is to filter to the baseline and shotblocker/help defender. That’s what he did on a number of these plays.</p>

<p>The JBrown dunk and Jrue drive were absolute blow by’s though. The last play he was mostly beat, but then fully gambled and attempted the reach in, which didn’t end well.</p>

      <label for="l7jdfje" class="commentText"><p>The problem is that against the Celtics they don’t really care if you’re filtering to a big. If they get their shoulders past you they can score on that big or force a foul unless the guy who got blown by provides back pressure. If you provide back pressure it means someone is open on the perimeter and they’ll find them for an easy 3.</p>

<p>Against the Celtics you really need to keep guys in front of you, and the man defender along with help defenders need to have active hands to disrupt driving lanes. If you can do that the Celtics will struggle to finish inside and be forced to rely more on midrange looks or kicking the ball around the perimeter and taking a contested 3. KP definitely makes that a lot harder though, because that kind of focus on preventing penetration means switching everything, and that opens him up to attack guards in the post.</p>

      <label for="l7j4huw" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s not in good enough shape to fly around the court all the time. Luka is amazing, but that&rsquo;s just the truth. He was gassed at times in that game. I think it was the first quarter where he had that wide open corner three and missed it horribly. He waved to the bench for a sub afterwards.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s so good offensively, and he&rsquo;s a decent one on one defender, so most of the time he can get away with it. Maybe he still can against Boston. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

      <label for="l7jg1g6" class="commentText"><p>I hate criticizing incredible players. Luka is a killer and is unstoppable offensively. He&rsquo;s a fierce competitor. He&rsquo;s not afraid of anyone or anything.</p>

<p>But I do think there&rsquo;s a level of commitment that the greatest of the great players have that he doesn&rsquo;t. LeBron, Curry, Jordan, Kobe&hellip; I&rsquo;m just naming the first few I thought of, but those guys put so much effort into their training and conditioning because they didn&rsquo;t want anyone having ANY kind of edge on them. No one was going to be in better shape. No one was going to outwork them.</p>

<p>Luka wants to destroy everyone he faces, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to really get up for the competition until they&rsquo;re right in front of him. The greatest of the greats are competing even when no one else is around.</p>

There was an interview a year or two ago where he talked about one of the biggest lessons he learned from Kobe was that if you want to win a Championship you have to &ldquo;be about it&rdquo; in every aspect of your life.  It has to be a driver in what you eat, what you do in your downtime, what you do in the offseason, etc.</p>

<p>Shaq wasn&rsquo;t about winning basketball games 100% of the time. That&rsquo;s famously what frustrated Kobe about him.</p>

<p>By all accounts, Jokic isn&rsquo;t living his life thinking only about winning championships.</p>

<p>I do think that Luka is so good that he could win a championship without ever truly taking his conditioning seriously. He might even do it this series.</p>

<p>But if you want to maximize your ability, you can&rsquo;t do that without fully committing.</p>

      <label for="l7jkrl6" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s funny how much he sometimes looks like Harden as a defender, in both a good and bad way. He&rsquo;s strong, and he&rsquo;s not going to get overpowered the way Tatum often overpowers smaller guards. When he isn&rsquo;t carrying the entire Mavs offense, he can move his feet decently well and work well in the Mavs system. But he (quite understandably, as with Harden) runs out of gas sometimes due to what he&rsquo;s asked to do on the other end, and when he&rsquo;s exhausted he can&rsquo;t contribute defensively on or off ball in the way that bigs can.</p>

<p>I wonder how much of it is also mental: he&rsquo;s such a chess master on the offensive end, and some of these lapses seem more about focus than physical exhaustion. Leaving Tatum wide-open from 3 when he had a lot of time to close out is a lot worse than giving Brown insufficient resistance on a drive.</p>

<p>LeBron is really good at getting the best bang for his buck defensively at this point, and while that&rsquo;s an unfair comparison I do wonder if an older Luka might be able to end up as a solid plus defender on a team where he&rsquo;s not The Guy Who Dribbles and he&rsquo;s able to apply more of his basketball savvy defensively.</p>

      <label for="l7iwvpa" class="commentText"><p>At least people don’t downvote when a Celtics fan says it. I’ll add on actual analysis here then. I think his rotations after getting blown by were the much bigger issue. Hes not gonna lock anyone down every time but when he does lose he has to rotate out. In other series like OKC he had done a better job of that but they also had one non shooter often out there.</p>

<p>End of the day, after the first quarter barrage, the Mavs defense held up pretty well. 26, 23, and 21 points in the next 3 quarters. The offense is by far the bigger issue. Role players besides PJ cannot do anything when they have Jrue or White on them and KP at the rim. DJJ/Green need to challenge KP less and keep the ball moving after attacking more.</p>

<p>I don’t think ball movement issues were just on Luka/Kyrie but role guys as well.</p>

      <label for="l7j2lvp" class="commentText"><p>This compilation doesn&rsquo;t show it, but Luka actually did a decent job on defense for good stretches of the game. I&rsquo;ll be honest, Luka&rsquo;s gotten better on defense than I thought he had. He&rsquo;s still far from a lockdown defender, but he&rsquo;s a solid, serviceable defender now which is a great improvement from where he was a few years ago. Although Luka&rsquo;s decent, even a good defender on occasion now, I like Boston&rsquo;s strat of running it at him, even if only to tire him out some and(hopefully) reduce his production on the offensive end.</p>

He has good size, isn&rsquo;t the fastest (but it&rsquo;s not like he guards small guards often), plays pretty solid on ball but has shown to be poor off the ball at times. I feel like it may be  in part from carrying the Mavs offense, but he looked a bit tired after coming off a long break.</p>

      <label for="l7izd6k" class="commentText"><p>This was honestly a poor defensive performance from Dallas as a collective, even watching these clips there’s a few plays where JB takes the inside shot but there’s still options on the perimeter as well, for example on the JB dunk not only does he have a relatively open lane to the hoop but 40% shooters Al Horford and Sam Hauser were both wide open.</p>

<p>This next game I guarantee Dallas will tighten shit up and Boston’s decision making on those drives will matter more, last night it felt like whatever option they took would work, but imo Dallas will commit harder to either blocking the kick out or the drive next game and JB/Tatum will have to continue to make the right decision every single time</p>

Id be more worried about offense if I were a Mavs fan. The role players all got locked up, the lobs just weren&rsquo;t there against Porzingis and if Kyrie keeps shitting himself its going to be a short series.</p>

      <label for="l7jq99o" class="commentText"><p>Not necessarily. Similar to what GS does when curry is doubled, have the trap higher or set a high screen and let Ant get the ball out EARLY.</p>

<p>If KAT is the screener him and Gobert have some chemistry in the big to big passing game. They’ll have space for outlets with  Ant, Mike, and Jaden on the perimeter. If you get a three out of it your two bigs are already in the paint.</p>

<p>If they don’t communicate at the top on the initial trap at the top, Ant can use his speed with a bigger runway(because of the higher screen) to get down hill and make plays.</p>

<p>Either way, they didn’t attack Luka in the pick and roll and their half court offense was terrible and then they had to deal with Luka who was not expending as much energy in the defensive side of the floor. The timberwolves are a talented team, they just beat the defending champions.</p>

<p>To only win one game, I feel, was an underachievement. There were things that would force the mavericks into rotation that I feel weren’t done. Falls on the players too they missed a lot of shots. But they were Isolating and not clicking together because they didn’t have the right guidance. Weren’t getting the right reads off they’re predictable plays.</p>

Our only offense the entire season was rudy setting a screen and Ants just not there yet fully with his passing and decision making. A LOT of our fans were questioning why we never used Kat/rudy in the big man pnr more or even just horn sets in general, we just stuck kat toward the corner almost every possession. Big time coaching failure on offense when it came to adjustments</p>

      <label for="l7j3o9o" class="commentText"><p>I think he held up his own. He&rsquo;s better now than 2 years ago. It takes Brown physically pushing him to blow by him, and Brown is a big dude. But his rotations are what makes him a lazy defender. He needs to at least try to rotate  and just show and not wait for the defensive rebounds out there.</p>

It has never been in his game. Also, this postseason he lacks speed in general, maybe because of his injury.</p>

Best defense against Luka is offense directly at him. Luka&rsquo;s too good to contain completely, but he&rsquo;s not immune to fatigue.</p>

<p>Mavs just don&rsquo;t have the horsepower on defense to stop the Celtics.  It&rsquo;s the entire problem with a Luka-Kyrie backcourt - you can maybe get away with one of them, but not two against a pair of wings like the Jays.</p>

      <label for="l7j75gn" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s a pick your poison type of situation. The craziest thing is that the open 3s are arguably a better poison for Dallas than just letting us slash inside nonstop. Their individual defense, at least on paper, does not match up well with either of the Jays. At least with the threes it&rsquo;s a game of percentages. If you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> give Tatum or Brown (Tatum in particular, you can watch the entire defense shift to him every time he strolled into the paint) as much attention as they got in Game 1 (which opened up everything else on the perimeter a lot of the times), you&rsquo;re risking higher percentage point chances over and over again vs. lower percentage three point opportunities.</p>

<p>Bear in mind we shot at our average three point percentage last night too - it wasn&rsquo;t uncharacteristically high or anything.</p>

It is not just that they targeted Luka because everyone tries to but rather how they did it, well they have two great offensive talent which make sit harder to hide Luka. The point is they set it up so that even if he rotates he ends up on Tatum which would be another blow by which will put more pressure on their bigs. These clips of Luka not rotating are misleading as well. The first is later in the game when Luka knows what is going to happen and that him rotating is not going to stop it lol.</p>

      <label for="l7jb3do" class="commentText"><p>Honestly the thing that surprises me the most is how often JB could give whoever is standing in the dunkers spot the easiest layup of their lives and he instead tries to draw the foul or tries to dunk with two people trying to contest. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that guy is standing right there specifically for the scenario where his defender decides to help defend whoever is driving to the basket and leaves him open for the free layup/dunk. Someone is there and open in almost every clip</p>

<p>You see an example with Jrue to White but that could&rsquo;ve happened <em>a lot</em> more</p>

      <label for="l7jdg10" class="commentText"><p>Yes JB&rsquo;s not a good playmaker. It&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s the ideal 2 and not 1.</p>

<p>Though I will say there is something good in just putting your head down and getting to the cup no matter what. Some times players get tripped up with having options. It&rsquo;s a whole nother skill to drive and be able to decide whether to shoot or pass in a split second.</p>

It&rsquo;s okay that guys like Jokic and Luka and Curry are poor defenders who get targeted because they make up for it with their offense. It&rsquo;s a weakness like Giannis&rsquo; shooting and SGA being Canadian.</p>

      <label for="l7j5nmn" class="commentText"><p>Luka is a fucking killer and I love watching him play, but he is a defensive liability. There was some thread here a couple weeks ago highlighting his &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; one on one defense.  I pointed out that there was help defenders both to his left and right side waiting to help out, which is why the players weren&rsquo;t driving on Luka, but I got downvoted to oblivion by Luka dickriders or maybe his PR team.</p>

<p>So weird now this is ok to show on this sub with so many upvotes.  I guess it depends on who the opponent is and who the powers of be are feeling like pushing at the moment.  Or maybe Celtic fans just wake up earlier?</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>

<p>Mavs need to counter this by hiding the fuck out of Luka on defense. Not sure how they can do this against the celts but the only way they win a game this series without that kind of adjustment is if boston has one of those rare games where they can&rsquo;t buy a bucket.</p>
