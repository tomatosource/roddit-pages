Zero pressure, just jacks up threes and makes all of them. You have no shot at a comeback and that 7 point deficit going into the 3rd ends up being like 25 in like 5 minutes</p>

      <label for="lreqqmf" class="commentText"><p>Okay, but considering the idea of a jump shooting team winning the championship was completely shattered the year prior, and the shift we are talking about the shift into the modern 3pt game, yeah the shift had already happened.</p>

<p>It’s a little silly to say the ring and the MVP didn’t change things but a shot in a regular season game when they were already chasing down the bulls did.</p>

<p>They already had the best start ever. They already won a title. They already had the MVP who changed the way the game was being played. The amount of teams shooting more than 27 threes per game had already doubled from the previous season from 4 to 8.</p>

<p>Like if that represents that shift for you, cool, but it very much had already happened and then some by the time this game happened. If anything it was more of an exclamation point than it was the beginning of anything</p>

      <label for="lrem2nh" class="commentText"><p>The entire double bang game was insane and it was in overtime for which Curry was the reason they even got there and Curry had hurt his ankle and had to leave that game then came back. Mind you, he was already going ape shit. <strong>Also, they needed to win to ultimately get their 73-9 record and they were at the brink of losing that game several times</strong></p>

<p>Olympic shot was insane too. 4 threes in a row to close out the game, Bron and KD left wide open, and the narrative that U.S champs are not world champs was going to be a fire storm for life if KD, Steph, and Bron lose. The difficulty level of the shot, the celebration after, the fact that it was for a Gold medal.</p>

<p>Both were sick and I feel bad for those that were not a fan of Steph before - he as a player was much crazier back then but the Olympic shot gave you a lighting-in-a-bottle moment of the type of player Steph truly is.</p>

      <label for="lrec6eo" class="commentText"><p>I’d argue the double bang put Steph on the map for many nba fans, propelling him into being a mainstream superstar as opposed to being the peak of his popularity. It was a prime time Saturday night game with nothing else on tv, becoming one of the highest rated non-Christmas regular season games ever. And that highlight was played over and over, obviously on channels like espn but also on non-sports channels and social media, bringing in more fans. I do agree though it solidified that was he and the warriors were doing was unheard of for basketball fans.</p>

      <label for="lrej0n1" class="commentText"><p>I disagree since Steph had already been a champion the season before and OKC was a big time contender and basically western conference rival.
There was a ton of hype for that game.</p>

<p>And Steph lived up to it and then some to prove this was truly something different. No one else could do what he (and the warriors) did and was doing.</p>

<p>Fast forward past that, they lose the championship, KD joins the warriors and steals some of Steph’s shine. It’s no longer the same. 2022 championship was great too, but it wasn’t the same feeling as the that 2016 season. That season was pure insanity as the NBA hadn’t caught up to their playstyle, Steph was by far the best regular season player that year, and it was before KD came which would make the feel of the team completely different.</p>

<p>After he hit that shot, I thought and I think others had the feeling that he would have a chance to enter the GOAT argument when his career was over because no one knew his limit. Of course it would all come crashing back down to reality in the finals loss, and the warriors ruined the NBA for awhile with KD and altered Steph’s legacy, and the rest of the NBA started to shoot a bunch more 3s and defend them better.</p>

      <label for="lrek02q" class="commentText"><p>Tons of hype for us as basketball fans, agree there. My point though is that while Curry was well known among nba fans, that game (in my opinion) really propelled him into mainstream stardom. The fact that he was a champion didn’t really matter - Jokic isn’t even somebody many non-NBA fans know, but you’d be hard pressed these days to find somebody who doesn’t know who Steph Curry is.</p>

      <label for="lrelunt" class="commentText"><p>You said nba fans in your comment above. Every nba fan knew who he was from 2015, he played lebron the most popular player, in the finals. But yeah propelling himself to superstardom is what makes that moment so defining.</p>

<p>And also when I say popularity, I don’t just mean well known, while Steph wasn’t ever hateable imo, he was certainly not the popular, in terms of “well liked” once KD joined the team. And in terms of mysticism, he lost a lot of it after the 2016 season for the reasons I said above.</p>

<p>So to me the double bang encapsulated the peak of curry. Now he may be more famous, but it’s not the same type of magic, likeability, mysticism that he had back then. That moment cemented him changing basketball.</p>

      <label for="lrem7a3" class="commentText"><p>I did say that, my bad. I disagree with you on sentiment towards Curry after KD joining. But we’ll just have to agree to disagree given that there’s not really any objective metric to define “mysticism”. Thanks for the positive convo this morning.</p>
