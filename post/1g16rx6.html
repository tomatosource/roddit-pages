<p>Also double bang was probably peak of Steph’s career in terms of popularity and league-breakingness and really solidified that what he and the warriors were doing that season was legendary and unheard of.</p>

      <label for="lrec6eo" class="commentText"><p>I’d argue the double bang put Steph on the map for many nba fans, propelling him into being a mainstream superstar as opposed to being the peak of his popularity. It was a prime time Saturday night game with nothing else on tv, becoming one of the highest rated non-Christmas regular season games ever. And that highlight was played over and over, obviously on channels like espn but also on non-sports channels and social media, bringing in more fans. I do agree though it solidified that was he and the warriors were doing was unheard of for basketball fans.</p>

      <label for="lrej0n1" class="commentText"><p>I disagree since Steph had already been a champion the season before and OKC was a big time contender and basically western conference rival.
There was a ton of hype for that game.</p>

<p>And Steph lived up to it and then some to prove this was truly something different. No one else could do what he (and the warriors) did and was doing.</p>

<p>Fast forward past that, they lose the championship, KD joins the warriors and steals some of Steph’s shine. It’s no longer the same. 2022 championship was great too, but it wasn’t the same feeling as the that 2016 season. That season was pure insanity as the NBA hadn’t caught up to their playstyle, Steph was by far the best regular season player that year, and it was before KD came which would make the feel of the team completely different.</p>

<p>After he hit that shot, I thought and I think others had the feeling that he would have a chance to enter the GOAT argument when his career was over because no one knew his limit. Of course it would all come crashing back down to reality in the finals loss, and the warriors ruined the NBA for awhile with KD and altered Steph’s legacy, and the rest of the NBA started to shoot a bunch more 3s and defend them better.</p>

      <label for="lrek02q" class="commentText"><p>Tons of hype for us as basketball fans, agree there. My point though is that while Curry was well known among nba fans, that game (in my opinion) really propelled him into mainstream stardom. The fact that he was a champion didn’t really matter - Jokic isn’t even somebody many non-NBA fans know, but you’d be hard pressed these days to find somebody who doesn’t know who Steph Curry is.</p>
