<p>Efficiency stats: Without KP he&rsquo;s shooting 48.5% FG, 30% 3PT, 85% FT.</p>

<p>With KP playing: 39% FG, 27.5% 3PT, 83% FT.</p>

<p>These are in the last 10 games, playoffs included. I think there is some value to these stats considering Tatum played 3 playoff series without KP, so there is some sample size for how he plays without him, even if it&rsquo;s not against Dallas so far. Obviously the stakes are much higher and the Mavs defense has done a great job against Tatum, but</p>

<p>From an eye test perspective, it always looked like Brown and Porzingis played better off of each other as opposed to Tatum and KP. KP shoots a lot of his 3&rsquo;s from the top of the 3 and from similar positions where Tatum is. And when KP is on the floor, Tatum is more of a guard instead of getting into the post which is where he improved greatly this season, both from a scoring and facilitating standpoint. Obviously Tatum has not shot well over the course of the playoffs and even though he shot <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> from 3 in game 1, he is going to have to either change his shot selection or his approach to 3&rsquo;s in this game. The pull-ups seem to never go in, but he is better when the ball moves to him around the perimeter.</p>

<p>Tatum has historically been pretty dependable in road games and he is also a very solid bounce-back player, as in he tends to have good games after dogshit shooting performances (which, lmao I guess game 2 could have been a bounce back from the bad shooting in game 1 but at least he cut his turnovers by half and doubled his assists).</p>

<p>Game 3 will be fun.</p>

      <label for="l8b2ngn" class="commentText"><p>I always feel like people are speaking past each other with this Tatum discourse.</p>

<p>Both things are true - over a larger sample size, and certainly during the regular season, Tatum is undeniably an incredibly effective scorer. And yet now for the second playoffs in a row, and second Finals in a row, his efficiency has dropped off a cliff. Celtics fans get defensive with it but there is no denying it is true. His shot selection has changed and generally he has just been horrible from 3pt.</p>

<p>I think another point worth considering is that Tatum is far from the only great player who sees an efficiency drop in the Finals. But it is certainly there for us all to see, and I dont really see what solutions to point to for him other than just making his shots.</p>

<p>One other point to make though - despite his shooting, Tatum is still INCREDIBLY effective as a PnR ball-handler in the playoffs. It is easy to keep track of a player missing shots during the game, less so to keep track of how possessions end when they start as the ball handler in PnR situations.</p>

      <label for="l8b64cn" class="commentText"><p>Nah I completely agree. It&rsquo;s because the shots he&rsquo;s missing are taken in rhythm and in the flow of the game. There was only like 2 times in the 4th when Tatum took a step back falling away midrange that felt unnecessary, but 95% of the shots he took felt like he had to take them. That&rsquo;s a big difference in his game from last year.</p>

      <label for="l8b7yok" class="commentText"><p>For sure, because he is still rebounding at a high rate and playmaking for his teammates. Honestly his defense has not been as stout as it normally is which is interesting and has been part of the Mavs offensive gameplan. But really it just comes down to making shots right. Tatum has not been so bad to the point that the Celtics are worse with him out there, but if he was making these shots at the clip he should be, they would be playing even better.</p>

<p>Of course that last point can be said about any player in any series shooting poorly. A distinction here is that this is now a recurring thing for Tatum in some of the biggest games. I hope he can lock in with his shotmaking but it is definitely reaching the point where it feels like a trend rather than an outlier</p>

      <label for="l8b4007" class="commentText"><p>I think the ways he&rsquo;s looking to score seem different in the post season too. I feel like he works off ball and in the post more in the regular season which helps him get more efficient looks. I also don&rsquo;t understand why he has completely abandoned the short mid range shots, like 10-15 feet. Those shots are what make KD and Kawhi, even Bron and Luka great because they will hit them if they get the space. Tatum has blown by Luka and other defenders numerous times, but he seems too focused on getting to the rim and passing out to the 3 point line. It has worked so far, so I can&rsquo;t complain, but in game 3 I feel like Dallas will give their absolute all and Tatum will have to attack every small gap he gets.</p>

<p>Another issue from his play in game 2 was that he had 2 separate drives where he went for dunks that were ill advised, both either got blocked or missed because he tried jumping from the FT line. I swear he was trying to go for a highlight dunk and could have hit a layup or done something else in those moments.</p>

      <label for="l8b7gfn" class="commentText"><p>Completely agree on p much all of this, and always refreshing to have real discussion in this sub lol.</p>

<p>Only thing I&rsquo;d disagree with is that he is <strong>too</strong> focused on driving and kicking. Him and Brown both have really leaned into that and it has seemed to be incredibly effective in breaking down Dallas&rsquo;s defense. The thing is, even with all of Tatum&rsquo;s drive and kick, he is still getting his shots up - it isnt like he is sacrificing shots to drive and kick. But he is missing most of those shots, and if he was making them at his normal clip, the Celtics would just be more effective in general.</p>

      <label for="l8b917q" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, love actual basketball talk instead of narrative shit lol.</p>

<p>But yeah I agree with what you said about driving and kicking. I think he should absolutely continue to punish the defense with the quick drives and reads, but when he does get to the rim it sometimes feels like he&rsquo;s almost over thinking it? or isn&rsquo;t even thinking about scoring until the last second. But also, I think that&rsquo;s part of the growth here which is also exciting. The ability to play at such a pace where you can decide last second whether to score or pass is what makes people like Bron, Jokic and Luka elite. And it&rsquo;s a great sign that Tatum is at least trying to operate like that.</p>

      <label for="l8bc0lr" class="commentText"><p>The playmaking was part of his game that has always had foundations there but he has never truly leaned into. Super interesting to see him doing so now and doing so effectively. Still needs to cut down on some of the careless turnovers but that is possible to do. What will truly allow him to reach his apex is to utilize the playmaking to open his shot up, and I think he is getting there.</p>

<p>People definitely lose sight of the fact that he is 26 because he has been in this spotlight for like 7 years already now. But just based off of the timing of &ldquo;primes&rdquo; for other stars, he is realistically two seasons out from his peak play. My hope is that they can FINALLY get over the hump this year and that Tatum can grow from it and finish rounding out his game in his 27-28 year old seasons.</p>

      <label for="l8bdyk6" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s exactly how I feel too! I also think winning this championship will take Tatum and  Brown&rsquo;s games to another level. They will be playing freer than ever, and I know this is weighing on them heavily no matter how good they are at tuning it out. LeBron turned into a completely new player after winning his first ring in 2012. It&rsquo;s like the ceiling for who he could become disappeared. I hope something similar happens for the Jays heading into their primes.</p>
