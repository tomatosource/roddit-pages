</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The biggest example is the Paul George trade. Now that Paul George left the clippers and they didn’t win anything as well as SGA being a star now, people automatically say that the clippers were stupid for making that trade. Like any GM at the time would not have traded those picks and players to get Paul George and reigning finals mvp Kawhi Leonard as well. Also nobody was clowning them when that trade happened at the time</p>

<p>Another example is the sixers choosing Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons at the time was the clear cut number 1, was actually great in his first few seasons, but now people act the Sixers are dumb for not choosing somebody else.</p>

<p>This also is about when Simmons got a max contract by the sixers over butler. Are you really telling me none of you would not do the same thing at the time. Simmons was a fringe all nba player at the time put more blame in them choosing Harris over butler then maxing Ben Simmons where it was universally seen as the right decision.</p>

<p>Making fun of these things and clowning those teams are fine in jest but clowning them for actually doing these decisions when they actually did it at the time is stupid when it was the obvious decision</p>

<p>Simmons was drafted ahead of Ingram/Brown/Fox and it was pretty much agreed it was the best pick until he got traded to the Nets.</p>

<p>Tatum/Mitchell/London were the year after.</p>

The 6ers best move would have been to do the same with Simmons, yes in hindsight, but we literally have an example from the very next year that shows GMs are more than capable of bucking the consensus. Thus the clowning they receive in hindsight</p>

      <label for="lmfu9tr" class="commentText"><p>Your first 2nd example isn&rsquo;t accurate, and for the 3rd one, people give the Sixers shit about maxing Harris way more.</p>

<p>To the overall point, there are a lot of GM decisions, especially in the draft, that using hindsight to judge the decision is fine. NBA GMs are paid to run teams because they are supposedly the best people at running a team. If they aren&rsquo;t running the team well, saying &ldquo;well, at the time it made sense&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t cut it for me. If you can look back and say &ldquo;yeah, with hindsight, I&rsquo;d still do the same move even though it didn&rsquo;t work out&rdquo;, then it was a good move. But if a move looks like shit now, GMs deserve to be judged</p>

Also genuinely, there are tons of new fans that start watching the NBA every year who will only know the trade &amp; wasn’t around before/when it happened. Like if you just started watching this 2023-2024 season unless you do thorough research, all you have is box scores to look at (if you even do that) &amp; just the overall perception that is the blockbuster trade.</p>

<p>Not like he’d take them to the finals. And his bright future is because he’s young and they’re older but getting veteran players has always been far better for playoff and title hunt than relying on younger players. Current NBA is trying too hard to portray every good player as a generational talent. The term means nothing now.</p>

      <label for="lmfud7g" class="commentText"><p>OKC just ended their rebuild last season and were the first seed in the west as the youngest or 2nd youngest team in the league. PG getting traded for SGA and picks was the reason for the rebuild ending so early. One of those picks is OKC’s second best player in Jalen Williams. We traded PG for an MVP candidate and one of the leading 4th quarter scorers in the NBA. These next few years will see if it was worth it or not, not just the <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> season.</p>
