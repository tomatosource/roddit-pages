<p>Played injured half the time too, league high 42 MPG for 82 games as a small guy. with load management he would maintain his prime way longer as well. This era fans don’t even know.</p>

Just cause it got overshadowed by the 3-point revolution, doesn&rsquo;t mean it stayed stagnant. Add to the fact that AI would basically be one of the worst on-ball defenders in the league and I honestly don&rsquo;t see much of an improvement. His scoring and efficiency might be higher but his impact to winning games wouldn&rsquo;t change much.</p>

      <label for="lo9q2m7" class="commentText"><p>In that era (which I lived through), he added so much scoring relative to the team output that you could afford to put defense-only guys around him. Bad defenders were way easier to hide/ Now everybody needs to score and space so that is way harder to do. The Grizzlies have done a decent job with Ja; the Hawks did a less-decent job with Trae. But 30+ppg is always gonna be real nice to have. He’d be at least as big a deal as Ja imho even with weak distance shooting and defense.</p>

      <label for="lo9eu2s" class="commentText"><p>I mean the real question is like, to what extent do we get to assume his game would have adapted to the modern thinking?</p>

<p>If you can assume he would cut out a lot of those long twos, put in more work as a three point shooter, refine his pick-and-roll game, and focus more on hitting the open shooter against the modern matchup-zone style defenses, then yeah he&rsquo;d probably be way more efficient.</p>

<p>One thing I feel like you need though as a guard is the ability to shoot the three off the dribble so you can punish passive pick-and-roll coverages.  You see very talented players like Ja Morant still struggle sometimes when teams try to force him to shoot.  That&rsquo;s not to say Morant isn&rsquo;t a great player but it&rsquo;s really, really hard to be a dominant guard without that skill, particularly in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And that skill has never seemed easy to learn if you&rsquo;re not already a good three point shooter in some form or fashion, and Iverson was pretty inconsistent from that range (career 31%).  Like his shot form itself was inconsistent and weird sometimes too.</p>

His shooting percentages relative to league average suggest that he cost his team points almost every season. He was his eras Russell Westbrook, except if Westbrook couldn’t rebound and wasn’t one of the best shot creators in the league. It’s possible he would adjust and be better today, but fans care more about efficiency relative to style than they did in AI’s prime, and his gross inefficiency would be constantly in the spotlight</p>

      <label for="lo9cy6n" class="commentText"><p>You don&rsquo;t even need to change his skillset.</p>

<p>Iverson&rsquo;s crossover was so deadly they had to ban it. Today&rsquo;s rules are much more lenient regarding carrying/palming. No defender the the league today could stay in front of Iverson if he&rsquo;s allowed to carry like Ja, Kyrie, Poole, etc.</p>

<p>Iverson is one of the best off-ball cutters in NBA history. He literally has a cut named after him. He&rsquo;d fit easily into any modern motion offense scheme.</p>

<p>Load management means Iverson doesn&rsquo;t have to hard-carry his team for 42mpg while playing through injury. Iverson led the league in MPG 6 times in 7 years, and played 42mpg in the season he didn&rsquo;t lead. Nobody in the modern NBA even averages 38mpg, including the guys who play for Thibs.</p>

<p>One of Iverson&rsquo;s biggest weaknesses was on-ball defense. But on-ball defense is far less important now than it was back then.</p>

<p>Iverson&rsquo;s size disadvantage on defense is also a lesser issue in the modern era, because so many teams play 2-PG lineups (or at least 2 guys who are PG-sized) - BOS, CLE, CHI, DET, HOU, IND, MEM, NO, POR, UTA, WAS.</p>

<p>In Iverson&rsquo;s era you had guards going 6-6 220 (Kobe, Jason Richardson), even 6-7 240 (Pierce, Joe Johnson). And they could post up if you put Iverson on them. Even PGs could post up back then (Cassell, Mark Jackson, Dre Miller). The only modern guard with that kind of size+power post game is Luka.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s lots of 90s guys who would be worse in the modern game. But the modern game is tailor-made for Iverson - a small, quick, athletic rim attacker. It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s Rik Smits or something.</p>

<p>I compared their stats to make your comparison look even more laughable. You attempted to make the argument that a 21-year-old LeBron becoming better later on (like nearly every player ever) is evidence for PRIME Iverson completely warping his skillset and playstyle for the modern era. The funny thing is that one-dimensional version of baby LeBron in that deadball era was a better scorer than peak Iverson.</p>

<p>Furthermore, presenting the most impressively adaptable player in the history of the sport as evidence that every player to ever exist would similarly adapt is so asinine that I’m not sure how anyone could believe it.</p>

<p>And if you consider that Iversons averages include him dropping off at the tail of his career and that the league averaged much fewer possessions…</p>

<p>He was hunted in his era because opposing guards could post up. Who in the modern era is running their offense through guard post ups? Pretty much just Luka.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s Utah gonna do to &ldquo;hunt Iverson&rdquo;? Post up Colin Sexton all game? It&rsquo;s CLE gonna post up Garland on him? Even Boston wouldn&rsquo;t spend all game posting up Derrick White if Iverson was guarding him.</p>

<p>Barely anyone in the league is even capable of post scoring anyways. Sure if he gets switched onto Embiid that&rsquo;s BBQ chicken, but you can say the same about any other guard.</p>

We don&rsquo;t need to assume that AI would &ldquo;magically be great&rdquo; at 3s. Actually, we could assume AI&rsquo;s 3pt% would be WORSE than it was back then, and he would come out ahead in terms of efficiency.</p>

<p>For example: AI shot 34% on 3s and 32% on mid range shots in 2000. So he was getting 1.02 points per possession on his 3pt attempts but only 0.62ppp on his long 2s. So a 3pt shot for AI was <strong>70% more efficient</strong> than a mid range jumper. Even if you assume his 3pt would decrease a bit with increased volume, it would be FAR more efficient than his mid range jumpers.</p>

<p>Take this, now factor in his increased efficiency at the rim with all the spacing. Yes his efficiency would skyrocket.</p>

      <label for="lo9dirb" class="commentText"><p>AI was a career 31% 3-point shooter. If he has to totally abandon his mid range game, and swap contested mid range shots for contested 3 pointers, that 31% will go down. Even if he somehow maintains 31% on double or triple the volume, that&rsquo;s awful efficiency.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say what would happen to his shots in the paint. More spacing, but his entire game of attacking from the mid range is gone. If you have to attack from the 3 point line instead of from the mid range defenses have more time to switch and move. That&rsquo;s especially bad for a small player like AI.</p>

<p>Dumping his super inefficient mid range shots will make his efficiency go up, but there&rsquo;s zero guarantee he can still put up anywhere near the same volume.</p>

<p>AI had below average efficiency in his own era. He&rsquo;d have to pull it up to his own era&rsquo;s league average, then pull it up even more to today&rsquo;s efficiency if he wants to be an average efficiency scorer. I honestly don&rsquo;t see that happening.</p>

      <label for="lo9b61m" class="commentText"><p>The concept of role players who didn’t create their own offense and thus enjoyed greater efficiency is not a phenomenon unique to Iverson’s era.</p>

<p>Rather, it is present in every era in league history. Including today. Look no further than Gobert leading the league in TS% in three separate seasons.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, star players who dominate the ball at a high volume are expected to <em>at least</em> have average efficiency, if not above average. Otherwise, you have 25+ shots a game producing inefficient offense. That is not good, and decreases the probability of the team as a whole producing efficient offense.</p>

Where he would excel in today’s game is attacking the rim and drawing fouls. Not shooting 3’s. These conversations are always asinine though because players molded their game to the play-style of the era. I’m sure if he grew up in todays era he’d be a much better outside shooter</p>

Certainly the metagame and his roster hurt him, but frankly he also had poor shot selection and bypassed open teammates for poor shots more often than he should have, even when he got onto a roster with better shooters overall than what the 76ers had.  It was a bit telling that the Nuggets offense improved after replacing Iverson with Billups.</p>

      <label for="lo9j54b" class="commentText"><p>Can you explain the roster problems to me? I’ve always thought that roster was incredibly well built for AI. He had multiple guys around him who could be secondary and even tertiary playmakers and a bunch of good defenders who could cover his weaknesses. Like if we’re switching teams with other players I could definitely see the argument that maybe if he had better scorers he would have been more successful as a whole, but I just do not see him winning multiple scoring titles and MVP if he’s not a one man scoring machine on offense.</p>

      <label for="lo9oefo" class="commentText"><p>It was really just the 3pt shooting.  The 76ers had almost no shooters on the roster.  They ranked 28th in attempts and 26th in percentage the year Iverson won MVP.</p>

<p>And the following year I think it was, they changed the rules to allow zone defenses, which exposed lack of shooting even more.</p>

<p>I do agree that Iverson doesn&rsquo;t really need other <em>scorers</em> per se, it&rsquo;s probably optimal for him to be kind of a one-man band given his shot selection.  But everyone needs some degree of shooting around them to keep teams from swarming them.</p>

<p>This is sort of debatable how much it affected him though, because it&rsquo;s unclear how much he would have given up shots even with better shooters, and because the defensive schemes didn&rsquo;t just change overnight.  Basketball is a game of habits and players had to unlearn the whole paradigm of standing there next to your man handfighting and &ldquo;honoring the 1v1&rdquo; so to speak.  There really was never a high level defense playing consistently in the passing lanes and in the in-between areas until the 04 pistons, and this wasn&rsquo;t really formally systematized and perfected until the 07 Celtics.</p>

<p>But still, you have to wonder what those 76ers would look like if you had a few sharpshooters on the team.  If nothing else, the shots he <em>did give up</em> would have gone in more often.</p>

Inefficient Hero Ball was a thing of the 2000s, now it’s efficient Hero Ball. If Luka, Shai, Beal can look like Megastars I think AI only does better in today’s NBA which favors the Stars and the offensive Talents.</p>

      <label for="lo9b3s7" class="commentText"><p>The other day, some nephew was using some stats to suggest Jason Kidd wasn&rsquo;t so important to his team. I was like wtf did I just read. Jason Kidd took Nets to 2 finals and he was THE offense. Their offense was Jason Kidd and 3 athletic runner-finishers (kerry kittles, Richard Jefferson, Kenyon Martin, Keith VanHorn) and 1 center. That&rsquo;s it. They had no half-court offense. It was a run and gun style where Kidd was at the heart of everything psuhng the pace and assisting. I don&rsquo;t care what the stats say. i watched that team with my own 2 eyes. They eliminated my pacers from the playoffs 2ce. For someone to argue Jason Kidd was not important to that team because of &ldquo;stats&rdquo; was just pure blasphemy.</p>

      <label for="lo99xnf" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s absolutely insane reading this thread seeing everyone treat a former league MVP like he&rsquo;d be garbage today. Like, do these regards not realize that if AI was born in the year 2000, he probably would have used his physical talents in a different way?</p>

<p>Your reference to kids is spot on. Most of these ridiculous takes are probably from ignorant teenagers.</p>

Allen Iverson led multiple poorly constructed teams to playoff series wins, including a trip to the finals. On the way to those very finals he played against efficiency king Reggie Miller and somehow gave them a gentleman’s sweep.</p>

<p>If Iverson was a net negative like “stats” people say then that must mean Eric Snow and Theo Ratliff are among the best players of all time</p>

<p>(b) You have not explained why you think that the 2001 76ers were poorly constructed. Would be nice if you didn’t dodge that question.</p>

<p>&copy; The 2022 Grizzlies were a 56 win team and lost in the second round to the eventual champions with their star player (the Iverson analogue in this comparison) missing half of the series. And given that the 2022 Warriors were better than anyone the 2001 76ers beat to make the Finals… yeah I think the 2022 Grizzlies certainly could’ve been a Finals team.</p>

<p>The Iverson 76ers made the finals, the grizzlies did not. No speculation needed. And if you want to engage in an argument about whether a team that has no shooters around an undersized slashing 2 guard and bigs who only score off put backs is well constructed then go right ahead and argue with yourself. It’s pretty obvious why Memphis has Bane and perimeter shooting JJJ around Morant</p>

<p>An actually efficient player, LeBron, led shit offensive teams top top 5 offensive finishes (08-09 cavs)</p>

<p>Or jokic, who has constantly led awful offensive rosters to top 5 offensive finishes</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what true MVP level talents do. Having them makes your offense good to great, not just mediocre. The reason that AI couldn&rsquo;t reach that level was his efficiency, which - and I know this is gonna shock you - does actually matter. Turns out missing shots is bad. Who knew?</p>

<p>I was just going back through the last 12 MVP winners and it’s some pretty steep competition. The only one I can think he might beat out is Westbrook, but he had some goofy numbers that year.</p>

<p>I still think AI would put up better numbers in today’s era assuming his 3 evolved.</p>

      <label for="lo9bah9" class="commentText"><p>Honestly he would struggle massively. His efficiency was always bad, and below league average in his own era. His TS% was only 51%, and the league average over his career was around 53-54%. It&rsquo;s only gone up since then. He also took a massive amount of mid range jumpers, around half of his shot attempts, at below average efficiency.</p>

<p>In his MVP season AI shot 26% from 3-10 feet, 33% from 10-16, and 42% from 16-three.</p>

<p>That efficiency just fundamentally doesn&rsquo;t work in today&rsquo;s game. You&rsquo;re going to have the worst offense in the league by far if you have a guy putting up 30 per game but getting it by shooting that inefficiently. He was also only a 31% three point shooter.</p>

<p>AI would need to either almost completely abandon his mid range game and develop into an elite passer and/or 3-point shooter (unlikely) or improve his mid range shooting by about 20% (impossible).</p>

<p>Maybe AI somehow totally changes his game and could adapt. But even in his own career he started to struggle a lot when teams began to get more efficient and he wasn&rsquo;t on a stacked defensive team.</p>

<p>His TS add was either largely negative or close to zero. Most of his points would come from the free throw line or two inefficient but high volume of 2 point attempts. Maybe he takes more 3s but he is a 30 percent shooter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT said:</p>

<p>If Allen Iverson were to play in the 2024-25 NBA season, his impact would largely depend on how his game adapted to today&rsquo;s style. While he was known for his scoring ability, speed, and handles, the modern game emphasizes three-point shooting and athleticism.</p>

<p>Iverson could potentially thrive as a bench scorer or a sixth man, using his quickness and ability to create his own shot. However, he might face challenges with the increased physicality and defensive schemes designed to contain dynamic players. Overall, his competitive spirit and skill would make him a valuable asset, but he’d need to adjust his game to fit contemporary NBA trends.</p>
