</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>TLDR: Paul Pierce (and Chris Paul, DeMar DeRozen and Russel Westbrook) are all far more clutch than people remember/think. Stats follow below showing they&rsquo;re all top 10 clutch performers in the modern era.</p>

<p>I see a lot of people on here hating Paul Pierce. Personally, I love him. I fell in love with NBA basketball because of Paul Peirce and the &lsquo;08 Celtics.</p>

<p>What I remember most about Pierce are his performances in the clutch. That ice cold 3 in Miami to seal game 5 in the 2012 ECF. Calling game in the twilight of his career. That elbow jumper that seemed to fall 80% of the time when we needed it most.</p>

<p>People have forgotten what a killer he was.</p>

<p>So I got myself a stathead account and snooped around. I wanted to see how Pierce compared with others since 1996 (when the shotfinder data started). Here is what I found.</p>

<p>In all searches, I looked for shots in one-possession games (score differential of +/- 3) in the last 2:00 minutes of the 4th quarter or OT, including regular season and playoffs between 1996–2024. This includes a lot of types of shots I consider clutch: to tie, to cut the lead, a dagger to increase the lead from 3 to 6, etc.).</p>

<p>Ranked by clutch field goals made, the top ten in that time frame are:</p>

<ol>
<li>LeBron James – 326</li>
<li>Kobe Bryant – 287</li>
<li>Kevin Durant – 203</li>
<li>Russell Westbrook – 200</li>
<li>DeMar DeRozan – 196</li>
<li>Dirk Nowitzki – 194</li>
<li>Chris Paul – 188</li>
<li><strong>Paul Pierce – 184</strong></li>
<li>Kevin Garnett – 172</li>
<li>Dwyane Wade – 170</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t require a win because I consider the bucket clutch the moment it&rsquo;s made, regardless of the eventual outcome. Requiring a win results in correlations with teammates as well, drawing the focus from individual to team. For completeness, though, here is the list of clutch buckets in an eventual win:</p>

<ol>
<li>LeBron James – 236</li>
<li>Kobe Bryant – 220</li>
<li>Chris Paul – 151</li>
<li>Kevin Durant – 150</li>
<li>Dirk Nowitzki – 143</li>
<li><strong>Paul Pierce – 140</strong></li>
<li>Kevin Garnett – 133</li>
<li>Russell Westbrook – 128</li>
<li>DeMar DeRozan – 126</li>
<li>Vince Carter – 120</li>
</ol>

<p>I also tried limiting the time range to Paul Pierce&rsquo;s career years: 1998–2017. This may be the best way to compare Pierce with peers in his &ldquo;generation,&rdquo; though it does bias things in his favor, since it by definition includes his whole career, while potentially excluding portions of other players&rsquo; careers. With that caveat, here is the list of most clutch shots during Pierce&rsquo;s career:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kobe Bryant – 281</li>
<li>LeBron James – 232</li>
<li>Dirk Nowitzki – 193</li>
<li><strong>Paul Pierce – 184</strong></li>
<li>Vince Carter – 167</li>
<li>Tim Duncan – 160</li>
<li>Kevin Garnett – 158</li>
<li>Joe Johnson – 157</li>
<li>Ray Allen – 147</li>
<li>Kevin Durant – 145</li>
</ol>

<p>How about clutch three-pointers? Same criteria as above: one possession game, under 2 minutes in the 4th or OT. No win required. Who are the clutch snipers?</p>

<p>From 1996–2024, the top ten are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ray Allen – 74</li>
<li>LeBron James – 62</li>
<li>Kevin Durant – 62</li>
<li>Stephen Curry – 57</li>
<li><strong>Paul Pierce – 54</strong></li>
<li>Kobe Bryant – 51</li>
<li>Damian Lillard – 51</li>
<li>Chauncey Billups – 49</li>
<li>Reggie Miller – 47</li>
<li>James Harden – 45</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My takeaways:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Paul Pierce is unarguably a top ten clutch player in the modern NBA (since 1996).</li>
<li>Depending on how you count &ldquo;generations,&rdquo; Paul Pierce is a top 5 clutch player and trails only Ray Allen in clutch three-pointers in his generation.</li>
<li>The Celtics &lsquo;08 big three looms large in these lists—a clutch team in general. But remember that a lot of their shots didn&rsquo;t happen while they were together on that Celtics team. (Same goes for LeBron and Wade.)</li>
<li>Dwyane Wade is up there too, and not far from Pierce by some metrics. To be fair, you can certainly find other clutch metrics that put Wade ahead of Pierce. However, while Wade has a clear lead over Pierce in some numbers (rings, All-NBA, etc.), he does not have a clear lead in the clutch and probably trails Pierce.</li>
<li>LeBron is the undeniable clutch king here. Even as a hater, I have to admit it. Even worse, for me, is that his numbers are still increasing. (But recall that these numbers only go back to 1996, so they don&rsquo;t tell us how LeBron compares with Jordan and older players.)</li>
<li>A lot of these names are not surprising. Of course LeBron and Kobe are taking those big shots. Same with Dirk, Durant, KG.</li>
<li>But I didn&rsquo;t expect to See Chris Paul up here. Known as a playoff choker by many, this guy does seem to step up in big moments.</li>
<li>And how about DeMar? Often remembered for LeBronto and Trash Bros infamy, yet the guy has icewater in his veins. Some of you may remember the back and forth clutch dueling between DeMar and Pierce in round 1 of the 2014 playoffs.</li>
<li>Westbrook, too. Arguably a top 5 clutch player. I thought he was reliable, but I didn&rsquo;t realize he was sniffing that rarefied air.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another point to bear in mind: When <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/2/18/21141286/nba-buzzer-beaters-leaders-history" target="_blank">The Ringer counted all time buzzer beaters</a>, Paul Pierce was tied with LeBron James for fourth at 7 apiece, behind Kobe (8) and Jordan (9). However, Paul Pierce also assisted on 5 buzzer beaters, the most ever. His 12 combined assists and shots at the buzzer are the most ever. With the game in the balance, the ball in the air, and the clock at triple zero, Pierce had made the most winning plays. (And don&rsquo;t forget his game 7 winning buzzer beater block on Kyle Lowry in Toronto in 2014.)</p>

<p>Last thought—a factoid for you Paul Pierce haters. Back in July of &lsquo;08, FMVP Paul Pierce was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120305153410/http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Paul-Pierce-says-he-s-the-best-player-in-the-wor?urn=nba,96670" target="_blank">asked</a>, &ldquo;is Kobe really the best player in the world?&rdquo; His response: &ldquo;I don’t think Kobe is the best player. I’m the best player. There’s a line that separates having confidence and being conceited. I don’t cross that line but I have a lot of confidence in myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lot of you will think he is conceited. I think he&rsquo;s a competitor. This guy had just beaten LeBron (in an epic game 7 shootout), the perennial contender Pistons, and the Kobe Lakers, crowning the run with an FMVP. That doesn&rsquo;t happen without the confidence he&rsquo;s talking about. It&rsquo;s also why Boston fans who saw him play will always love him.</p>

<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t all about himself. Ever the team-player, when asked the follow-up, &ldquo;Who are your top five favorite players in the NBA today?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t hesitate: &ldquo;Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo, Kendrick Perkins and Paul Pierce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>EDIT: One more stat to nibble on: Win percentage in clutch performance games. Taking the ten players from my first list, I&rsquo;m dividing the number of games where they had at least one clutch shot and their team won by the number of games where they had at least one clutch shot, regardless of outcome:</p>

<ol>
<li>Chris Paul – 80.5%</li>
<li>Kobe Bryant – 75.1%</li>
<li>Kevin Garnett – 74.8%</li>
<li><strong>Paul Pierce – 71.9%</strong></li>
<li>LeBron James – 71.3%</li>
<li>Dirk Nowitzki – 71.4%</li>
<li>Kevin Duran – 68.6%</li>
<li>Dwyane Wade – 68.4%</li>
<li>Russell Westbrook – 61.0%</li>
<li>DeMar DeRozan – 59.7%</li>
</ol>

<p>All the same caveats I mentioned above for eventual wins still apply, but this stat is interesting. It could just mean that the top guys had the best teammates. It could also mean that some of these guys were more likely to hit a dagger than to tie. There could also be a charisma factor: when Chris Paul hits a clutch shot it just rips your team&rsquo;s soul out, but when DeMar cashes in on a big three you still feel pretty good. You decide.</p>

So you get penalized for &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; clutch opportunities. Right now, this seems like a list of people who had the ball the most in clutch time rather than a list of most clutch players (although there&rsquo;s obviously heavy correlation).</p>

      <label for="lg84ufb" class="commentText"><p>I get why people love him and why people hate him. But at the end of the day Pierce was just another player who was a top 10-15ish player in their prime who also had a long list of accolades that come with that.</p>

<p>He is a significant step below all-time greats. D-Wade, for example, has accomplished feats that the truth could only dream of. 2006 Finals. The best Heat player in the 2011 heatles over lebron. And countless more.</p>

<p>There is more to basketball than being a “killer” too. The “baller” mentality has already been discussed a lot so I won’t dwell on it.</p>

<p>The truth is that the truth needs to let it rest. The older retired players who continually get discussed are players who won mvps, won dpoys, led 60 win juggernauts as the lone superstar, or revolutionized the way the league plays ball.</p>

<p>Let’s now revisit Paul’s biggest claim to fame. Everyone remembers the 2004 pistons. And most people will remember the Paul’s 2008 Celtics in a similar fashion. Not as two teams led by all time greats, but as well oiled machines led by a great cast of all-stars who knew their role.</p>
