      <label for="lldyhsm" class="commentText"><p>Yes but this video is late, most of these guys and a lot of others considered him the GOAT before he had even won a title. He was just so demonstrably better than everyone else. Even in his rookie season he looked like an alien out there on the court, just moving differently.</p>

<p>edit: this is a much more contemporary video but just check what Charles Barkley says here - <a href="https://youtu.be/kHYs9p6XHxM?si=nc5pczP4moHF3yJk&amp;t=3m10s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/kHYs9p6XHxM?si=nc5pczP4moHF3yJk&amp;t=3m10s</a></p>

<p>Starts at around 3:10 if time stamp doesn’t work. What’s funny is Chuck even there is slightly misremembering, it didn’t take very long for MJ to win his first MVP - it happened in his third full season, same year he won DPOY. But he probably just meant the general acknowledgement of MJ as the best player.</p>

      <label for="lldzail" class="commentText"><p>A big component that no one brings up in this debate is LIVE play.</p>

<p>With MJ, it was soul crushing type competitiveness that comes out more when you aren’t watching retroactively. It was tangible to the extent he retired twice at peak play - like he didn’t have anything else to prove, and everyone just nodded in agreement. Lebron has never come close to MJs sense of nothing else to prove. Lebron has always felt more of an underdog story with his style of play and competition/roster dynamics.</p>

I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate LeBron more as I&rsquo;ve gotten older and I think his era is much tougher than Jordan&rsquo;s for a variety of reasons, but 4-6 in the Finals while hand-picking your supporting cast for most of your prime is not the same. Also feel the East was comically weak for many of Bron&rsquo;s runs. Trash Bros were his biggest competition many of those years, which is a relative cake walk.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say rings were irrelevant here; he was in the midst of a dynasty and everyone knew it. There was that recency bias of &ldquo;this guy is the champ right now.&rdquo; And of course that is combined with amazing stats and great all around play.</p>

<p>So as usual, it was multiple factors. People could tell he was phenomenal just from watching or playing against him. But the fact that he was a winner certainly helped.</p>

      <label for="llh415p" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one person&rsquo;s opinion and certainly impressive. Then again, Jordan was drafted third behind Sam Bowie, so obviously not everyone shared that perspective. And Knight is a college basketball coach and Jordan won an NCAA championship, so again, winning was probably part of the equation. Still amazing that Knight saw that in Jordan so early. </p>

<p>Magic Johnson also said he expected Lonzo Ball to be an all-time great Laker and have his number retired, before Lonzo had even played a game. Clearly that didn&rsquo;t work out. So that&rsquo;s the risk of early career predictions.</p>

<p>These are all enormous egos and insane trash takers all in unison saying MJ is on another level. Magic and Bird were the biggest icons of the NBA at the moment and once MJ dropped 60 on Larry in playoffs with a team that would put process Sixers to shame he was like &ldquo;oh fuck&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the equivalent of Shaq, Duncan, Kobe, Garnett, Scalabrine all coming out saying &ldquo;yeah LeBron is the clear GOAT&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Which none of them did because they also played against MJ. Those are legit people that played against aging Jordan and prime LeBron and went &ldquo;nah not even close&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But nephews will refuse it because it&rsquo;s the wrong narrative.</p>

      <label for="llenqvo" class="commentText"><p>It’s just hard to describe to young folks what it felt like when MJ was in his prime and won the first one. No one had ANY doubt who was going to win, and win again, and win again, and win again… he was brutal. It was like KD warriors, but all because of one dude (i know it wasn’t all because of one dude, but that’s what that shit felt like).</p>

<p>That, for one reason or another, never really existed with Bron. Some of it is competition, some of it is Bron legitimately choking vs Dallas, destruction by San Antonio…</p>

<p>I am not one of those who thinks it’s not even close, it is close. But MJ will remain the goat in the minds of majority, and I don’t think this will change going forward.</p>

There was never any doubt what was going to happen in the end. It was inevitable and tangible and you could feel it in those moments alongside everyone else.</p>

<p>Like when Jordan stripped Malone at the end of game 6 in 98. Everyone knew what was about to happen.</p>

      <label for="lleud6h" class="commentText"><p>Even before the loss to Dallas, LeBron had been getting called LeChoke for a couple years. He had had some amazing playoff performances, but he also had a few series where his team was the favorite and he couldn&rsquo;t close things out because good enough defenses were able to key in on the holes in his game. Then there was the criticism for passing instead of shooting in clutch situations and quitting against Boston. Even if he&rsquo;d won not 4 not 5 after the loss to Dallas, the earlier criticisms would have prevented him from having the air of invincibility that MJ had. Yes, it took MJ a few years and an improved roster to succeed in the playoffs just the same as LeBron, but during those losses no one ever put the blame on MJ because his own play was spectacular.</p>

<p>He won for the first time in what… his 9th season?  And only after he had Pippen?</p>

<p>Then he lost in 1995 as well… until trading for the prior 2x DPOY / nba champion / 7x rebounding leader in Rodman?</p>

      <label for="lle898q" class="commentText"><p>One of the biggest challenges for MJ in the goat debate is that he came before Lebron, and that he was very much crowned as the GOAT before he even retired the first time.</p>

<p>Because of this, MJ had no one to chase, no real accolades to feel he needed to meet, or anything left to prove relatively early in his career. Once he got #6, he had the bragging rights over his good friend Magic, and probably didn’t care to achieve much else. At that point, Kareem’s scoring record meant nothing in terms of MJ’s ability, especially because he had the highest PPG ever (over Wilt) and the record 10 scoring titles.</p>

<p>Knowing MJ’s competitive spirit, who knows what he would have achieved had he had something or someone to still chase in his 30s.</p>

<p>For example, we saw with Denver this year, how much more lethargic they were in the playoffs. A lot of the player admitted they didn&rsquo;t have the hunger and drive after winning the championship the year prior.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, MJ had the compeititive will to 3 peat twice. Dude was a maniac. I can&rsquo;t imagine how driven he would be if he and Lebron shared an era. We could of gotten a crazy Messi/Ronaldo esque dynamic.</p>

<p>It’s kinda of the same for any MJ fans who say he would have won 8 straight without retiring. In the end, MJ still won so many times, despite the would of and could ofs of his career.</p>

<p>Well first of all, teams win championships, not individuals.</p>

<p>Second, that argument is only made when Jordan truthers incessantly yell &ldquo;6 rings&rdquo; over and over again.</p>

<p>Like ok, the best regular season team of all-time, former champs added at worst a top 3 player who will be at the very least top 20 all-time.</p>

<p>Imagine Jordan playing the Jazz with Hakeem the dream in his prime to go with Stockton and Malone.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why Bird and magic are in my top 5.  Boston had to beat a prime Pistons team and then beat th Lakers.  Lakers had to beat the friggin Celtics.</p>

<p>If they had played a little longer, they&rsquo;d both have very legitimate goat cases</p>

<p>MJ was fortunate those guys were aging out as the Bulls reached their prime.  He was also fortunate to have a goat coach who won 5 rings without MJ.  He was also fortunate to have a FO who actually surrounded him with talent and a vision.</p>

<p>Look at Lebrons first stint with the Cavs and tell me who his Pippen was.  Rodman?  His Phil Jackson?  Don&rsquo;t get me started on the FO.</p>

<p>Lebron took that team to the finals and very likely does it again if the Celtics don&rsquo;t pull off a series of blockbuster moves to bring in Ray and KG.</p>

<p>But even still with that Roster I don&rsquo;t see how we beat the Lakers.</p>

<p>This goat debate has to have nuance or it&rsquo;s utterly dumb to even converse about it.</p>

<p>So yes, it absolutely matters that while Cleveland was having their best run in Franchise history that Lebrons second and third best players were out in the playoffs and finals.  It absolutely matters that when they beat the 73-9 best reg season team ever, that team added the 2nd or 3rd best player in the league and one of the greatest scores of all time in KD.</p>

<p>Competition matters.</p>

      <label for="llf2tmr" class="commentText"><p>You can’t measure it that way because you don’t get today’s basketball without MJ. The “be like Mike” era helped pave the way for elite guard play, and ushered in guys like Kobe, Iverson, Allen, Carter, McGrady, Wade, and so many others. Even today, players like Edwards emulate and study Michael’s mechanics. He was even LeBron’s favorite player growing up.</p>

<p>What separated Jordan was that he was innovative. Everyone in the video was in awe of him because the game we see now as normal didn’t look that way until Michael came in and changed it. Your argument would be the same as someone in 30 years saying Curry was “lucky” because his shooting took place in the 2010s before 3pt shooting was the norm. Meanwhile, Curry’s innovation is what helped spearhead that movement.</p>

      <label for="llf7tb2" class="commentText"><p>Curry’s influence on the 3 point shot is way more of a watershed moment for the sport as it’s actually played than anything MJ actually did on the court. He won a lot of games and is certainly the greatest player of his era but he did not change the way the game was played in the same way that Curry did. The only player I think who really compares in that way is Mikan</p>

I’m sure Scottie is mad about it, but probably doesn’t direct that toward Mike. I always got the vibe that the mostly one-sided beef was more about Scottie’s compensation and recognition relative to Mike’s.</p>

And anybody considered a goat before him was a big man. It didn’t take too many seasons of being the best weapon to be crowned the greatest. Sure, championships and accolades needed to be stacked up for legacy points but a large part of People’s determination of greatness then was the eye-test when compared to their peers. And he was more head and shoulders above his peers than anyone in how he played.</p>

It&rsquo;s a bit of a shame, I&rsquo;d love to see players in either sport come close to that level of dominance in my lifetime just to watch.</p>

      <label for="ller59k" class="commentText"><p>This video shouldnt be titled with &ldquo;GOAT&rdquo;. They are clearly talking BEST. As in BOAT. Which is different.</p>

<p>MJ definitely was and is the best player the world has ever seen even before his rings but the winning made him the GOAT too.</p>

<p>If MJ had retired with 2 rings or something like that then Kareem, Lebron or Bill would be the GOAT. But MJ would still be the BOAT.</p>

<p>MJ&rsquo;s 6 rings on top of the best play in history far outweighs Bill Russell&rsquo;s 11 rings however.</p>

<p>But if Lebron who is among the closest to MJ&rsquo;s play would have won 8 rings then he would have become the GOAT.</p>

      <label for="llfrk06" class="commentText"><p>Well, MJ is partly at fault for how the GOAT conversation changed. He was considered the GOAT even before he won his championships, it seems during his time, championships weren&rsquo;t a criteria to be considered the GOAT.</p>

<p>But then he went and won all those championships that it permanently changed the criteria.</p>

<p>If he didn&rsquo;t dominate the 90s in such a convincing fashion and win all those championships, then championships may have never been part of the GOAT criteria.</p>

<p>I used to find it annoying 15 years ago, but now it&rsquo;s almost unbearable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same arguments, the same points over and over on a subject on which there&rsquo;s no good answer anyway.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re all debating, as if your opinion were interesting, as if you knew how to debate. I&rsquo;ve seen people argue for hours, only to realize in the end that their criteria for greatness just weren&rsquo;t the same, since greatness isn&rsquo;t an objective notion.</p>

It&rsquo;s a valid take.  Can&rsquo;t deny that Jordan&rsquo;s the greatest of his era, but a part of his success had to do with the Celtics, Lakers and Pistons aging out, the fact he had another MVP-level talent as a running-mate (Pippen won 55 games the year Jordan was retired), the fact that he league had watered down by adding 6 teams during his championship stretch, etc, but he was undeniably amazing.</p>

      <label for="llfoslm" class="commentText"><p>Bron played in a much tougher league with a lot more competition.  Jordan had an MVP in Pippen alongside him and was playing in a watered down league with no real elite teams other than the Bulls after teams like the Celtics and Pistons, that had dominated Jordan, finally aged out.</p>

      <label for="llfqyr6" class="commentText"><p>And you certainly have Data to back that claim up.</p>

<p>I will give you some:</p>

<p>The &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s produced the most top 75 player. The &lsquo;00s+&lsquo;10s the least. </p>

<p>Lebrons era is weak as hell on top talent. Besides Lebron, no Consensus top 10 player played in his era. The best are Wade, Curry, KD, Giannis, Jokic, who are in the 12-30 range.</p>

<p>Jordan played Bird + Magic, Kareem, Barkley, Malone Zeke, Shaq. All in the top 25 range. Magic, Kareem are top 5, Bird and Shaq are top 10 </p>

<p>Top 75 &lsquo;80s+&lsquo;90s</p>

<p>Jordan, Bird, McHale, Magic, Worthy,Zeke, Rodman, Drexler, Barkley, Ewing, Malone, Stockton, Payton, Pippen, Wilkins, Nash, Allen, KG, Kobe, Duncan, Kidd, Iverson, Shaq, Miller just to Name a few.</p>

<p>Greats like Kareem, Parish, Walton, Moses, Dr -J, dantley, McAdoo etc&hellip;</p>

<p>Talking about a watered down league, look no further than lebrons weak, defense starved era where the top player all teamed up! </p>

<p>Weak and soft!!!!</p>

<p>I watched Jordon. I’ve watched more Lebron. Lebron is the more complete player. But Jordon is the guy I want with the ball in the 4th quarter.</p>

<p>This will never be settled until Jokic retires with 7 championships and is the undisputed goat haha</p>
