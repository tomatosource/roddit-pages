Even throughout that first rookie year you had a lot of people arguing Carmelo was the better of the two (for that year. after that year it became pretty clear it was Lebron). Carmelo would&rsquo;ve gone #1 in a lot of years.</p>

      <label for="lfkzabb" class="commentText"><p>LeBron was the clear #1, but I remember a lot of fans being a little skeptical of him because he was coming straight out of high school. Especially after players like Darius Miles, Kwame Brown, and Eddy Curry had been underwhelming. Obviously anyone who watched LeBron&rsquo;s high school games knew he was already significantly better than those players.</p>

<p>Most people did think both LeBron and Carmelo were locks to be future Hall of Famers.</p>

      <label for="lfm39ej" class="commentText"><p>The pros: 10-time all-NBA, 6-time all-star, 1 scoring title, 10th total points scored leader.</p>

<p>The cons: Not only did Melo never get a ring, he never even made it to the Finals. He won 3 playoff series in 19 years playing for the NBA.</p>

<p>The greatest argument for Melo making the NBA Hall of Fame, in my opinion, is his Olympic career—three gold medals and a bronze. But like&hellip; I waffle on whether that should matter for the HoF. Olympic basketball only ever seems to be brought up with Carmelo specifically, something to make up for an otherwise generally underwhelming NBA career. No one talks about Michael Jordan&rsquo;s Olympic medals when talking about GOAT status. Melo did have a stellar college career at Syracuse, but I definitely feel like that shouldn&rsquo;t be factored in. Other than that, a combination of an enormous ego, a generally bad work-ethic, and a pile of much better contemporaries (LeBron, D Wade) all lead me to say no at this point. Not first ballot at any rate.</p>

      <label for="lfm4jtg" class="commentText"><p>I think I would choose the bear.</p>

<p>But seriously, CP3 has had a better-looking career in my opinion. Multiple All-Stars, assist leaders, steals leaders. Carmelo scored more points and got more rebounds, but CP3 was a more efficient shooter and much less selfish with the ball. CP3 could fit in anywhere, Melo had to be the center of the universe.</p>

<p>I freely admit I&rsquo;m a sucker for a floor general, so I might be biased, but yeah, of the two, definitely CP3 for me.</p>

<p>Also see like Melo for his entire career, you ignored defense. Lebron avg more steals and blocks but even more importantly was a good defender capable of guarding 1-4. </p>

<p>Lebron had zero capable guards on his team. He did have big Z and Boozer. In other words he had two slow footed bad defenders behind him who also clogged his driving lane. </p>

<p>Melo had Andre Miller, as steady of pg that had ever been born. He also had Nene and Camby to cover his defensive short comings, both agile and neither demanded the ball on the block. </p>

LeBron didn&rsquo;t come into the NBA as a good defender and certainly wasn&rsquo;t out there guarding 4 positions effectively.  He obviously became an all time defender but it&rsquo;s revisionist history to act as if there was any real difference between him and Melo on defense in their rookie year.</p>

<p>If you want to die on that hill stop at steals/blocks.  Backing it up with the idea that LeBron was effective guarding 1-4 is insane.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Carmelo definitely had a big camp of backers and supporters (and rightfully so) but Darko going number two wasn&rsquo;t a shock to everyone. The moment Detroit landed that pick in the lottery, it was presumed among many that Darko would be their guy (GM Joe Dumars even <a href="https://youtu.be/czJy7ZdmW7U?t=64" target="_blank">hinted as such</a> right there in the post-lottery interview).</p>

<p>In the lead-up to that draft, it was broadly understood that LeBron had No. 1 locked up but that it&rsquo;d be a relative toss-up between Carmelo and Darko at No. 2. Melo did have hype for the reasons you mentioned, but Darko came in  hot while riding the coattails of media members and scouts who were all racing one another to unearth the next Dirk Nowitzki. And since the Pistons&rsquo; biggest gap was that of a true center, folks knew Darko had a good chance of heading to Detroit.</p>

      <label for="lfllod7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I have to say, as a Pistons fan at the time, everything I heard about Darko—even before we landed the second pick—made him sound like a sure thing. Actually, not only a sure thing, but the next big thing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d have been one thing if the scouting reports were something like, &ldquo;Darko has a lot of potential waiting to be tapped. Great base, may have a bright future that could include multiple all-star appearances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, every time I read a new article on him I&rsquo;d find <a href="https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2014/9/24/6841293/rip-hamilton-reaction-darko-milicic-2003-nba-draft" target="_blank">quotes like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Darko reminds me of a young Wilt Chamberlain. Wilt used to do a little of everything, and I haven’t seen a big man with so much skill since Wilt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;More than Nowitzki, Gasol or even Divac, Darko has a nasty streak in him that will help him succeed in the post,&rdquo; a league executive said. &ldquo;A lot of the Europeans are really threes in the pros. He&rsquo;ll be a true low-post player. His coach is doing us a huge favor by forcing him to develop those skills now. He already has moves that remind me of (Hakeem) Olajuwon in the post. Once we get a hold of him, the sky&rsquo;s the limit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was literally the best workout I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I&rsquo;ve seen hundreds and it was the best. When you have a 7-1 kid, who is 17 years old, doing the things he was doing, it was a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; moment, especially for a team that needed a big man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, naturally, I figured if writers and scouts were casually mentioning a 17-year-old in the same sentence as Wilt Chamberlain, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Dirk Nowitzki, this was probably going to be as sure a thing as LeBron &amp; Carmelo, except in the frontcourt, where the Pistons needed the most help. I thought even if Darko didn&rsquo;t reach his full potential that his basement would still be all-star level, at least based upon all I&rsquo;d heard (which is all I had to go off of).</p>

<p>I believe his career would have looked different if he went to Detroit. He would have developed other parts of his game. Carrying a load offensively was his role in Denver and he never developed outside of it</p>

      <label for="lfljub2" class="commentText"><p>If we&rsquo;re talking about the month of so leading up to the 2003 Draft itself, everyone operated in the shadow of LeBron&rsquo;s hype, particularly after Cleveland landed the first pick.</p>

<p>That being said, once you scratched past the surface of the LeBron hype, there was a whole lot of buzz for the top three picks that year as a whole, which were understood to be LeBron, Melo, and Darko in some order (with LeBron being the absolute No. 1). As others have said, freshmen leading teams to NCAA titles just didn&rsquo;t tend to happen, yet there was Melo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some here stating that it was a complete shock to everyone when Melo was passed over by Detroit at No. 2. I&rsquo;ll say that&rsquo;s not particularly accurate. <em>Some</em> people may have been shocked but there&rsquo;d been a groundswell of hype surrounding Darko Milicic in the lead-up to the draft as well. <a href="https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2014/9/24/6841293/rip-hamilton-reaction-darko-milicic-2003-nba-draft" target="_blank">A sampling</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what really excites them is his mature low-post play. &ldquo;More than Nowitzki, Gasol or even Divac, Darko has a nasty streak in him that will help him succeed in the post,&rdquo; a league executive said. &ldquo;A lot of the Europeans are really threes in the pros. He&rsquo;ll be a true low-post player. His coach is doing us a huge favor by forcing him to develop those skills now. He already has moves that remind me of (Hakeem) Olajuwon in the post. Once we get a hold of him, the sky&rsquo;s the limit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have Darko as a clear-cut No. 2,&rdquo; West exec No. 2 said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Detroit coaching and scouting legend Will Robinson:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Darko reminds me of a young Wilt Chamberlain. Wilt used to do a little of everything, and I haven’t seen a big man with so much skill since Wilt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, what might give you the best insight on Melo&rsquo;s hype (or the hype of the three as a collective), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJWlFgR37Q&amp;" target="_blank">is watching the 2003 NBA Draft Lottery</a>.</p>

<p>The thing that ends up surprising the younger crowd—aside from the fact that there were people out there who thought Darko would actually be good (sheepishly raises hand)—is that Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade were relative afterthoughts in that same draft. It LeBron/Darko/Melo, a large gap, then the rest of the field. (Edit: Afterthoughts may be too strong of a word, Miami and Chicago werehyped to grab them, they were just never considered to be top 3 pick possibilities.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You pretty much draw a line after the top three, because there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a whole lot there,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;id=1524922" target="_blank">said one Western Conference executive</a>, referring to the trio of aforementioned studs he&rsquo;s not allowed to discuss by name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember mocks having Dwyane Wade all over the map. Generally no higher than five, but as low as 10. It also seemed popular to have him slotted to go home to Chicago (the Bulls had to settle for Kirk Hinrich instead).</p>

      <label for="lflfy0x" class="commentText"><p>I mean Bron was the biggest hyped prospect since Kareem, possibly of all time, and there were definitely people who thought Melo would be the better player. He instantly signed with Jordan-brand and there were 3rd pick campaigns basically insinuating that he was picked 3rd like MJ and was going to go on to be the best. Mostly a dig at the Bowie/Darko picks.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say he was more “hyped” than a lot of other really good players, people didn’t put a GOAT-tier ceiling on him like Bron for example, but he was definitely considered a “can’t miss” “sure thing” type of prospect that would be a future star. I’d say the hype was somewhat comparable to when KD was drafted.</p>

      <label for="lflrcis" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know how old you are, but as far as players since him to get drafted, the only player who came close as far as the hype was concerned was probably Anthony Davis (who had a very similar pre draft arc, freshman leads team to title), and maybe Greg Oden. If there was literally any other prospect besides the guy being dubbed “the chosen one” in high school being in the same draft, he would’ve gone 1st.  The only players who had more hype than him entering the draft since were probably wemby and Zion. He was massive.</p>

      <label for="lfkzq0w" class="commentText"><p>Thought he&rsquo;d be an all time great scorer but was a tad overshadowed by Lebron. Everyone thought the Pistons were dumbasses for taking Darko over him, and they were. Carmelo pretty much had a career close to what people thought he would without ascending to winning a championship or two.</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t help but feel if he had a slightly better situation/coach who liked him in the beginning or better surroundings in NYC he might have done a little better. Karl was a tad demeaning while also a good coach. As a player, he always gave a team hope though. Even though people would never think it if you asked many players in the league when he was there who the toughest player to guard was, they&rsquo;d tell you Melo even over Kobe.</p>
