<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s (Jokic) playing the game, and you think he&rsquo;s not serious, but he&rsquo;s so effective,&rdquo; Olajuwon said. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look strong, but I see he gets such a deep post position. I think maybe it&rsquo;s the mismatch, but then he does the same thing against bigger guys. His shot, his fakes, they are very difficult to time. You don&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;s faking and when it&rsquo;s real. He has tricks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He’s the one,&rdquo; Olajuwon said.</p>

<p>Jokic is often compared with Joel Embiid. There are numerous NBA fans that think Embiid should have gotten the MVP trophy last year over the Serbian center. Olajuwon says the Philadelphia 76ers star has a weakness in his game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got all the moves, but leveraging the moves is different. Why would he be shooting threes? He has the advantage every night, and if I have the advantage, I&rsquo;m going to wear you out. That&rsquo;s settling! When I&rsquo;m tired, I settle,&rdquo; Olajuwon explained. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t settle when you&rsquo;re trying to win. You don&rsquo;t start the game settling!&rdquo;</p>

I don’t know what part of 7 ft 280 doesn’t seem strong to people either. And he’s impossible move in the post, that’s not just technique. He’s a big ass dude, and brutally strong.</p>

      <label for="lk2ytsc" class="commentText"><p>If you’ve seen Jokic play in person (I have, twice) you’d know he would be fine in any era. That dude is MASSIVE in real life. I’m not talking his height, he’s 6’11 or 7’0, so obviously a tall guy. I’m talking his build. He has a huge frame (some of the widest shoulders I’ve ever seen) and is thick thru his chest and, critically, legs. He may not be cut or jacked but he is very strong functionally and, critically, knows how to use his weight/frame.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, Jokic is listed at 284 lbs. Other than Shaq, none of the top C’s in the 90’s weighed close to, let alone more than, that. Here’s some of the top C’s of the 90’s:</p>

<p>Robinson: 235
Mourning: 240
Ewing: 240
Mutombo: 245
Smits: 250
Hakeem: 255</p>

<p>The idea that Jokic would get pushed around by 90’s C’s is…something. He’d be fine.</p>

      <label for="lk2j0tj" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s just a misguided view of athleticism. Jokic to my eyes is clearly very strong, and tbh at some point it’s just physics, that dude is throwing a lot of weight around.</p>

<p>But Jokic can’t jump over a basketball, he has the classic “deceptive quickness” in some areas but is generally very slow especially in top speed and lateral movement. So people dismiss the athleticism.</p>

<p>But he can play 79 regular season games then a dozen playoff games then the Olympics. He moves superbly around the court for his size, not quickly but smoothly, including often handling the ball from the perimeter. He’s an immovable stone on the inside. That’s a whole lot of athleticism.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to look at other sports.</p>

<p>Look at Steven Adams, he doesn&rsquo;t have bodybuilder muscles. Serge Ibaka was more cut than Adams, in terms of muscle definition.</p>

<p>Yet pretty much everyone agrees that Adams is much stronger than Ibaka.</p>

<p>Nikola Pekovic was another guy like Adams - widely regarded as the strongest guy in the league during his career, but he never had show muscles like Dwight.</p>

      <label for="lk3nogj" class="commentText"><p>I think people are misunderstanding my comment a little. Bodybuilders look way more ripped than strongmen, but are much weaker. Strongmen have a ton of muscle and some fat on top. The extra fat makes them look less toned but it makes them heavier and even more powerful.</p>

<p>Jokic seems to be the same way. Really strong, plus a little bit of extra fat that makes him look less defined but probably helps make him more unmovable in the post.</p>

<p>He is nowhere near as strong as a strongman and has a slimmer build. But I think Jokic might actually have some success if he transitioned into strongman comps. Hafthor was a 6&rsquo;9&rdquo; 230lb basketball player before he became a strongman. Of course Hafthor bulked up to 400+ lbs lol. Don&rsquo;t know if Jokic would be capable of that.</p>

Embiid settles because he&rsquo;s always worn out, and it&rsquo;s painfully obvious in the playoffs. Embiid may be one of the best scorers &amp; jump shooters ever, but he&rsquo;s never put 100% into optimizing his body in the off-season, and it&rsquo;s already cost him big time.</p>

      <label for="lk2u7jo" class="commentText"><p>IIRC Embiid has always has some conditioning issues. I remember hearing about his diet in his early days with the 6ers and it was crazy. It&rsquo;s a shame because he is such an incredible talent and I think if he spent more time working on his health/conditioning he could be a clear cut best player in the world. Then again it&rsquo;s also really hard to get in shape when you&rsquo;re injured a lot of the time. Almost like a bit of a vicious cycle. He gets hurt, so his conditioning suffers, which causes him to get hurt again, and it just continues on.</p>

His highlights look like he has every move and incredible footwork, but he actually catches himself in a lot of bad situations, almost like he premeditates his move before he does it rather than playing within the flow of what a defender gives him. Makes for some amazing highlights but less consistent possession to possession.</p>

The current NBA is so much different than the NBA that Hakeem played in and I’d love to see which of their strengths/weaknesses would stand out and even which would just disappear.</p>

Between Dream&rsquo;s passing ability and the fact that one of the best tools you want to have if you&rsquo;re going to attack a double team from either low or mid post is a good spin move to either split the defense or create angles, I actually think Dream&rsquo;s game is well designed to attack that defense. Add in the fact that you do have to respect his midrange jumper, so he can initiate his offense against one on one coverage if he wants, means he can dictate a lot when he&rsquo;s setting up the play. A lot of advantages for him.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Defensive three seconds was added in 1959.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s odd this caught on as a fact.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense on its face. There are a bunch of proscribed defensive positioning rules and you think they allowed defenders to camp the paint as much as they want? It&rsquo;s kind of the flip side to people thinking zone defense was illegal. It wasn&rsquo;t forbidden so much as made kind of shitty by rule.</p>

      <label for="lk43a93" class="commentText"><p>I don’t understand your comment on the defensive three second rule. Prior to that rule, all zone defense was illegal - teams had to play man to man.  And you could only send direct double teams, where as now you can run Thibs’ infamous “ICE” defense with a player just outside the lane on the ball side, without being attached to another player.  Thibs innovation (and I’m sure there’s many other examples) and the progeny of defensive strategies that grew from that, make it much harder for the 1 on 1 play that Hakeem played with for most of his career.  </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong - Hakeem would be awesome in any era.  But I think you are overstating and/or misunderstanding how the rule changes impacted gameplay, with all due respect.  </p>

      <label for="lk2tjz1" class="commentText"><p>What?  With the amoeba switching and relentless PNR mismatches Hakeem would foul out the other team’s wing rotation in about 20 possessions.  This man averaged 35+ in a series guarded by Dennis Rodman and David Robinson - who outside of Hakeem x2 were the 3 time refining defensive player of the year.  He did that for the series!</p>

<p>Hakeem had other playoff series where he averaged 8+ stocks.  He would win DPOY on default in this ERA and put up 32/15/5 IMO.</p>

<p>Yeah I’m a nut hugger but you would be too if you saw him play from 1983 on.  And watch his highlights.  He had a jumper out to 20 feet and could e handle the ball.  They just didn’t play that way in his era.</p>

<p>Hakeem would be a lot worse without the illegal defense rules. He was allowed to go 1 on 1 for most of his career.</p>

<p>Young Hakeem got doubled all the time because he sucked at recognizing it and passing out of it.</p>

<p>Prime Hakeem fixed that. You played him 1-on-1 because if you didn&rsquo;t, he was finding the open man on the perimeter. Even if he didn&rsquo;t get the assist, he&rsquo;d get a hockey assist.</p>

That doesn&rsquo;t make him an elite passer. And those teams were massively helped by the shorter 3pt line.</p>

<p>Modern defenses would give up those shots so easy.</p>

      <label for="lk352gl" class="commentText"><p>With Hakeem&rsquo;s offensive repertoire? I think it&rsquo;s the exact opposite. He&rsquo;d flourish even more because he can shoot decently in the perimeter, is efficient in the charity stripe, has great handles for a center, and has the best footwork. And he is a willing passer as well. With today&rsquo;s spacing, he&rsquo;d be flirting with a quadruple-double on a nightly basis.</p>

      <label for="lk5t3o7" class="commentText"><p>People are losing their minds, quadruple double? Are you braindead?I love Hakeem but common.</p>

<p>Hakeem wasn&rsquo;t a great passer. He just wasn&rsquo;t. The build a whole team around him to allow him to make simple passes. He had the team with the best spacing in the whole league.</p>

<p>And they did this in an area where other teams hadn&rsquo;t yet realized the importance of the 3, and the 3 was shorter then now. Defenses would act like that for long.</p>

<p>He could get the points and rebounds. But concomitantly get 10 assists, just fucking no. Giannis is a much more dynamic passer and is avg 7 max. Not even Jokic gets 10 assists consistently.</p>

<p>And getting 10 blocks consistently is even more outrages. Stop it.</p>

If he can’t carry the ball, he has no ball handling ability and would probably play back to the basket. That’s a problem because he has no post moves to speak of besides beasting guys. And even if they’re not as athletic, every team had 2 huge dudes. He’s not mowing over Charles Oakley/Patrick Ewing for 40 a night. He’d be interesting. Maybe he’d be amazing. I wonder if he’d gain weight and become a defensive minded 4</p>

His speed would also make him great for pick and rolls. Due to his lack of 3 I can see him take some close mid range shots and being a lob threat.</p>

<p>Some players are just great no matter which era you put them in and they come from different eras. I enjoy all eras and appreciate what they brought from their time.</p>

      <label for="lk2sfpq" class="commentText"><p>It’s not a wrong take either and in the end it means nothing. In a 1v1 game it is fair to think Hakeem absolutely cooks Jokic.</p>

<p>The reason this means nothing is because they aren’t playing 1v1. One of Jokic’s greatest gifts is his passing and IQ of how to use his teammates. In a team setting the matchup between the 2 becomes much more equal and you can make an argument in either direction.</p>

<p>Yeah people like to post about how huge Shaq or Malone or Robinson were&hellip;but in reality all of those guys were a good 10 to 15 kg lighter than Jok is now.</p>

<p>Shaq is the clear exception, but he didnt really get to the size he is famous for during Hakeems prime and he certainly didnt have Jokices footwork (dunno why they pretend that Jokic doesnt have post moves too lol).</p>

      <label for="lk2w445" class="commentText"><p>Shaq&rsquo;s FTr was 0.83 for the entire playoff run up to that point.</p>

<p>Against Houston, his FTr was less than 0.57.</p>

<p>Getting that many assists was a function of good defense and Shaq having to give up the ball.  Anyone other than Shaq having the ball was an advantage to Houston.</p>

<p>He got to the line 10 times/game simply due to playing an absurd amount of minutes in the Finals.  Dream absolutely did not shut him down, but he contained him far better than anyone else did in the playoffs, gave him the business on the other end too, and that&rsquo;s why Houston walked away the champs.</p>

<p>Jokic is an all-time great, no one is shutting him down, but this idea he&rsquo;d back down Dream with little opposition is silly.</p>

      <label for="lk30yhw" class="commentText"><p>Bingo. One of the big myths in nba history is that Hakeem “shut down shaq” or some BS. No, they were an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object. Shaq shot 60% from the field that series, along with almost 13 rebounds, 6 assists, 2.5 blocks per game. Hakeem rightly won FMVP but the deciding factor was the rest of the rotation and the rockets having the extra depth and better perimeter shooting. Also, 2 games were decided by 5 points total. It was a sweep, so you can’t say it was a close series. At the same time, two or 3 possessions go differently and it’s a 2-2 series very quickly.</p>

      <label for="lk2qvkp" class="commentText"><p>You mean when a 22 year old who was 40 lbs away from his top weight dropped 28 ppg on 60% shooting on him at his peak?</p>

<p>This shit is so stupid. Go watch any game that series. The Rockets were doubling Shaq on the catch because Hakeem was completely unable to stop him from getting very deep post position. Which is why Shaq had one of the best playmaking series of his career.</p>

<p>Whenever Shaq got a true one-on-one against Hakeem he completely overpowered him. The only stops Hakeem got were when he swiped at the ball as Shaq was on the way up, because he knew if it was a foul Shaq wouldn’t make him pay at the line.</p>

<p>Rockets even played two center lineups with Charles Jones out there with Hakeem at the end of the series, and Jones would defend Shaq with Hakeem roaming off Horace Grant.</p>

<p>22 yo Shaq BBQ’s Hakeem in one on ones consistently. Peak Shaq would put Hakeem in the basket.</p>

<p>Hakeem was great but the idea that 14 year olds who play 2K all day have of him is delusional. He wasn’t an efficient scorer for a big because of his shot selection, he was a pretty limited passer for most of his prime, he was vulnerable to matchups against bigger stronger dudes and wasn’t a particularly effective perimeter defender despite peoples’ assumption that he could switch like Draymond in today’s game.</p>

<p>It’s pretty funny going back and watching full games of the ‘95 Finals (Game 4 used to be on YouTube in full 7-8 years ago) and hearing the announcers roast Hakeem for his poor perimeter defense and talk about everything Houston was doing to avoid Shaq getting one on one opportunities down low.</p>

<p>People born after Hakeem retired act like he could guard anyone from Steph to 2000 Shaq…</p>

<p>Yet he still backed Hakeem down and needed to be doubled 60% of his possessions, and still scored 28 on 60%. Also fun note Hakeem could not back baby Shaq down at all and had to settle for middies which drove his efficiency down to 41% when defended by Shaq.</p>

<p>I think there are a lot of questions marks about Hakeem as an offensive engine because of his playmaking. I don’t have the exact numbers with me but iirc even when the Rockets won, there playoff offenses weren’t too great.</p>

      <label for="lk2ibfx" class="commentText"><p>Also with no zone defenses, post scoring was muuuuuch easier back in the day. Especially since it’s the one area where the physicality allowed today isn’t too dissimilar to back then. The reason post scoring is so hard today and not worth going to outside of a handful of guys isn’t because it’s hard to cook a dude one on one in the post, but because it’s so easy for defenses to load up around the paint and disrupt the post player if he enters the paint unless the offense is countering (which teams still don’t do often enough).</p>

One of the primary reasons why he was able to outplay Shaq in the 1995 NBA finals was him passing out of those double teams better.

</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true, Jokic&rsquo;s weak point is quickness more than anything else.</p>

<p>During the prime Harden days, they were eating the Nuggets and Jokic alive, so much so that the Nuggets literally tanked games to avoid meeting them in the playoffs in 2019. The reason is the Rockets were exploiting Jokic&rsquo;s lack of quickness, which allows for easy switches, and allowed Harden and Paul to go 1 v 1 against Jokic every game.</p>

<p>David Robinson is a significantly better defender than Jokic, and Hakeem completely demolished him (35 points per game) in every way. The idea that Jokic would do fine against Hakeem in the post is hilarious, and this isn&rsquo;t even a knock on Jokic. Hakeem wouldn&rsquo;t just be attacking Jokic in the post like Shaq, he&rsquo;ll be pulling him out to high post areas (since Hakeem is also a mid-range threat) as well to force him to move his feet.</p>

      <label for="lk4fg4o" class="commentText"><p>Yes, Hakeem, during his peak seasons, had a TS% of 56 or 57%. Jokic hit <em>70%</em> the year before last. Jokic was 12% above the league average, while Hakeem was about 4% above the league average. That 8% gap against league average between Jokic and Hakeem is the same size as the gap between Hakeem and the incredibly inefficient <em>Scoot Henderson</em>. And that&rsquo;s before taking into account playmaking/passing, which is inarguably Jokic&rsquo;s greatest strength as a player.</p>

      <label for="lk4ek3o" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s not how it works. Jokic is a generational scorer but what puts him in that GOAT territory level of play is how he makes everyone much better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen teams be as bothered with defending a single player than they do with Jokic. They are literally defending ghosts. Because they never know if Jokic is gonna make a pass behind them or not.</p>

<p>If Hakeem had been on Jokic&rsquo;s level. He had won a couple of more chips in the 90s.</p>

      <label for="lk4ddw8" class="commentText"><p>I grew up in the late 80s / early 90s in peak basketball. Watched all the greats, especially those playoff series in the years leading up to the Rockets mini-dynasty.</p>

<p>As great as Hakeem was, you never saw Hakeem having to leave midrange to guard somebody at the extreme end of the perimeter for a big with Jokic&rsquo;s range. Jokic&rsquo;s range would have presented new problems and ways to open up that Houston defense and in fairness, we can say that Hakeem would have adapted, but its hard to know if you put the championship Rockets vs Championship Nuggets how that would fare.</p>

<p>The first title year 93-94 Rockets, I actually think the Nuggets would have given them problems - especially once Hakeem is forced out to the 3Pt line to defend Jokic, who&rsquo;s going to guard Aaron Gordon or any of their other athletic guards/forwards? Its not Vernon Maxwell or Kenny Smith, and not Otis Thorpe or Matt Bullard or any of their bigs. MAYBE Robert Horry , but he was only a rook that year too. Marie Elie was a great hustle player but he&rsquo;s only 6&rsquo;5, so he isn&rsquo;t guarding anything tall and fast either.</p>

<p>Both Rockets and Knicks that year were built similar - HOF big man, and surround them with versatile role players who can play at both ends of the floor. The best high usage shooters the Knicks had were Derek Harper and John Starks, but Kenny Smith was one of the MAJOR x-factors for that rockets team that year. The man was highly efficient year shooting 40% from three, and i remember him hitting countless big time threes in the Finals when they needed it most. The teams were constructed similar, but the Rockets simply did it better and if you watch the game tapes you&rsquo;ll agree.</p>

<p>Hakeem was a nightmare matchup for Ewing because he was skilled at midrange, and off the dribble - so that was likely the furthest Ewing would have had to travel in his career to guard someone besides say, David Robinson. In some ways, this same matchup nightmare Hakeem created for Patrick, Jokic could have replicated against Hakeem as well and exploited for his team&rsquo;s benefit, just like Hakeem did vs Ewing.</p>

<p>Different game different eras, both are all time greats in my view for different things that they are/were elite at.</p>

Not just post def and blocking, but he&rsquo;s also a good perimeter defender. But offensively, while hakeem got sweet moves, he&rsquo;s a better second scorer than as a main one.</p>

<p>Jokic is the centerpiece of your offense if you got him. He has got no weakness on that side of the ball. People also underestimate this guy&rsquo;s stamina. No one is tiring him out and i don&rsquo;t think any past centers (except shaq) can do that to him.</p>

Lebron and Jokic would make the old rules of defending look broken with the way guys had to not sit in the passing lane (yes I know it was only enforced if the ref wanted to I’ve seen old games). I’m talking John Stockton numbers of assists. If you had to actually double those guys and not just bait doubles they would casually get even more assists.</p>

      <label for="lk5pujb" class="commentText"><p>The thing is, the weakest part of Hakeems game was his passing. He was a good scorer but not a driver of elite offenses. He takes lots of hard shots, with good efficiency, not ELITE efficiency. If you look at his advanced numbers, a lot of his benefit comes from his defense. They had to build the team around Hakeem making simply passes. And that worked really well, specially when the 3pt line was shorter. But modern defense are also much better at dealing with the simply kick out.</p>

<p>In my opinion, in modern basketball you want the guy who can drive elite offense even against elite defense even when not shooting well for a game.</p>

<p>That said Hakeem would still crush in todays game.</p>

      <label for="lk5yeab" class="commentText"><p>Why do they always overlook Jokic&rsquo;s strength, Jokic would absolutely back down Hakeem, he&rsquo;s moving any center on the backdowns even Embiid?</p>

<p>Why are they always try to shit on Jokic, dude won a chip for the team that drafted him at 41 with the weakest supporting cast ever? Didn&rsquo;t ask to trade shit teammates or get traded to a loaded team as he should have years ago stayed and won like you supposed to do.</p>

<p>He played for the forever shit franchise and shit coach (still shit and can&rsquo;t coach if jokic is not on the court)</p>

<p>He got into the playoffs consistently with Will Barton as a 3rd best player on the team, Will Barton people if you watched 1 game of his you hated basketball as a sport after that experience.</p>

      <label for="lk3n4fz" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem would get the best of the match up most of the time. Styles make fights. He would give Jokic the 3 but Jokic would have work wayyy harder to score. He would still eat on passing.</p>

      <label for="lk3oun8" class="commentText"><p>This is the same type of shade Steph gets in terms of visually dismissing based on appearance. But see strong Joker results against guys like Giannis, Embiid . . Would Hakeem really be that different?</p>

      <label for="lk5m45j" class="commentText"><p>Like any other dabate:</p>

<p>Take peak Hakeem and put him in today&rsquo;s era - great  inside offence and defence. Embiid basically with better defence.</p>

<p>Take peak Joker and put him in 95 - he will be destroyed in defence. Offence, maybe yes, but Ewing, Zo, Shaq, Admiral, Hakeem, +PF will destroy him.</p>

<p>But take 20yo Hakeem and put him in collage, draft him and give him 2 years in NBA - potential goat</p>
