</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to take a look at some &ldquo;futures&rdquo; <a href="https://decider.com/2018/09/11/rounders-at-20-most-influential-gambling-movie/" target="_blank">bets</a> to gauge the best bets for different awards. Now, these aren&rsquo;t pure predictions as much as indications of value. Someone may be the most likely pick to win MVP at 5:1 odds, but if another player has nearly as good of a chance and is listed at 50:1, that longshot is the better &ldquo;bet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been running this series for three years now and have had some surprising success.</p>

<p>In 2021: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 on each post, you'd have made \)</span>2,000 profit, buoyed by Tyler Herro winning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ph5khd/oc_the_best_bet_series_predicting_the_sixth_man/" target="_blank">Sixth Man of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 on each post, you'd have made another \)</span>2,000 in profit, buoyed by Mike Brown&rsquo;s trophy for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xm19cz/oc_best_bet_series_predicting_the_coach_of_the/" target="_blank">Coach of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>Last year: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 one each post, you'd have made... \)</span>25 in profit. Sooo&hellip; basically enough for a chipotle burrito and guac. But still, a profit is a profit, so let&rsquo;s see if we can keep the streak going this year. For each category, I&rsquo;ll take a look at some viable candidates first, and then make an official recommendation at the end.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>STUDYING THE TRENDS</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all familiar with the Rookie of the Year trophy, and there&rsquo;s not a ton of tea leaves that you can read into the previous list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award#Winners" target="_blank">winners</a>. Usually, whoever puts up the best stats will usually win the trophy. Voters are more lenient in this category when it comes to W-L record and advanced stats/efficiency than other awards because there&rsquo;s a built-in understanding that the best rookies are going to be doing some heavy lifting for bad teams.</p>

<p>As you may expect, that group of winners tends to come from the top draft picks. They don&rsquo;t have to be THE singular top draft pick, but they tend to come from that bluechip status. 9 of the last 13 winners (69%, nice) were drafted inside the top 3, including Victor Wembanyama last year.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>French retreat</strong></p>

<p>Last season, rookie Victor Wembanyama entered the season at -110 odds for Rookie of the Year, which translated to over 50% chance of winning the award. That&rsquo;s basically unheard of when it comes to awards bets because the field is so deep. In most categories, the favorite will be about +400 (which means if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100, you win \)</span>400 profit).</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s rookie class shows an even more wide-open field than usual. Like Wembanyama, the top two picks hail from France. But unlike Wembanyama, they&rsquo;re not even the top favorites for the trophy. Bovada lists Atlanta&rsquo;s <strong>Zaccharie Risacher</strong> (+800) and Washington&rsquo;s <strong>Alexandre Sarr</strong> (+900) at longer odds than you&rsquo;d expect for the # 1 and # 2 pick.</p>

<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s understandable. Sarr is a project; he didn&rsquo;t even start for his Australian league team last year. Risacher is further along (having contributed to a top team in France) but currently plays more of a 3+D style that doesn&rsquo;t always beget big statistical returns. Of the two, I&rsquo;d consider Risacher in the event that the Hawks allow him more opportunities and he showcases more &ldquo;in his bag&rdquo; than we&rsquo;ve seen so far.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>from NCAA stars to NBA newbies</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned, the # 1 and # 2 picks aren&rsquo;t the favorite for the award. It&rsquo;s not # 3 or # 4 or # 5 either. For the first time, a # 9 pick will be the betting favorite for Rookie of the Year in the massive form of <strong>Zach Edey</strong> (+525).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand why Vegas would be high on Edey&rsquo;s chances for an immediate impact. Already 22 years old, he was clearly the most productive player in the NCAA last year. The 7&rsquo;5&rdquo; monster averaged 28.4 points and 13.7 rebounds per 36 minutes for Purdue. And here in the NBA, he&rsquo;s likely going to slide right into the starting lineup for the Memphis Grizzlies. If Edey gets 25 minutes a game, there&rsquo;s a very real chance he averages 15-10. Better yet, he&rsquo;ll be doing that for a playoff contender.</p>

<p>There were a few other players who dominated college play last year, including Edey&rsquo;s title game rival <strong>Donovan Clingan</strong> (+1500), who will go from UConn to Portland. I really like Clingan&rsquo;s defense and basketball IQ; he reminds me of Isaiah Hartenstein in that way. From a &ldquo;Rookie of the Year&rdquo; perspective, the challenge is that Clingan hasn&rsquo;t always played big minutes (20.8 per game last year) and doesn&rsquo;t always put up gaudy raw stats either.</p>

<p>Putting up gaudy stats isn&rsquo;t a problem for <strong>Dalton Knecht</strong> (+1100), who averaged 25.5 points per 36 for Tennessee last year. Like Edey, he landed in a good situation for himself with the L.A. Lakers and new coach J.J. Redick. Presumably, Redick will encourage the team to take more threes &ndash; which may lead to a starting role for Knecht. At age 23, Knecht may be ready for that opportunity. If he shines in L.A., there&rsquo;s no doubt that the headlines and spotlight will follow.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>youth movement</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always easier for older rookies like Zach Edey or Dalton Knecht to make the transition to the NBA and make an immediate impact. More often than not, the &ldquo;one-and-done&rdquo; freshmen struggle for a few seasons until they find their footing. They&rsquo;re often the worst players in the NBA from a statistical perspective.</p>

<p>Former Kentucky guard <strong>Reed Sheppard</strong> (+650) may be the exception to that rule. Even as a freshman, he was stone cold efficient. He shot 53.6% from the field, 52.1% from three, 83.1% from the line. And despite being a 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; combo guard, he averaged 3.1 steals and 0.9 blocks per 36. Those are ELITE advanced stats for his age. From an analytical perspective, he should have been the # 1 prospect in the class.</p>

<p>Can he translate that to the NBA right away? Possibly. The one concern you&rsquo;d have is that he&rsquo;ll be joining a Houston Rocket team that has hard-charging Ime Udoka at the helm and playoff aspirations in their eyes. Will Udoka play a rookie like Sheppard 25-30 minutes a night? Even with PG Fred VanVleet on the team? TBD.</p>

<p>A similar question may come for Sheppard&rsquo;s college teammate <strong>Rob Dillingham</strong> (+1800) who will join the Minnesota Timberwolves. Minnesota aggressively traded up for Dillingham, but they may want to slow play his development as they chase a top seed. As talented as Dillingham may be, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a 175-pounder teenager being ready for NBA caliber defense.</p>

<p>Speaking of &ldquo;one-and-done&rdquo; freshman, San Antonio will have one of their own in <strong>Stephon Castle</strong> (+900). He&rsquo;s essentially on the opposite end of Dillingham. His defense is further along than his offense. There was some talk about him being a lead guard (which would be a boon to his stats), but the Spurs brought in Chris Paul to spearhead the attack instead. Castle will get his opportunities, but I liked his chances more before the CP3 signing.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>going deep</strong></p>

<p>In an unheralded and uncertain rookie class, you may want to take some wild shots and longshots.</p>

<p>To that end, here are some names to monitor. At the guard spot, shooter <strong>Jared McCain</strong> (+3500) may get time with a winning Philadelphia team. <strong>Carlton &ldquo;Bub&rdquo; Carrington</strong> (+1500) will get time with a not-as-winning Washington team.</p>

<p>There are some talented but young wings as well, including <strong>Ron Holland</strong> (+2200) for Detroit and <strong>Cody Williams</strong> (+2500) for Utah. On the older side, new Orlando wing <strong>Tristan da Silva</strong> (+5500) could be more ready to contribute and could add some much needed spacing to the club. New Miami center <strong>Kel&rsquo;el Ware</strong> (+3000) also has a good opportunity to earn minutes as a counter-punch to smallball big Bam Adebayo.</p>

<p>In terms of DEEP shots, I also like the idea of <strong>Ja&rsquo;Kobe Walter</strong> (+10000) in Toronto. Walter wore down over the course of Baylor&rsquo;s season, but he&rsquo;s a natural 3+D wing who&rsquo;s earned comparisons to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Depending on what happens with Toronto this season, there&rsquo;s a chance that he could earn his way into the starting lineup and make a real darkhorse push for this award. At 100:1, the payout would be juicy. Forget chipotle burritos; you could buy a franchise with that win.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>AT LONG LAST, THE OFFICIAL PICK IS&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Simply put: this rookie class is a clusterfuck. There&rsquo;s limited top-end talent but decent depth, making this award difficult to predict. It&rsquo;s like the Kentucky Derby, only if they funneled 100 donkeys into the starting gates instead. To help mitigate some of that chaos, let&rsquo;s spread our money around a little bit.</p>

<p>If I had to predict the most <em>likely</em> winners (regardless of odds), I&rsquo;d go 1) Reed Sheppard, 2) Zach Edey, 3) Zacc Risacher. I don&rsquo;t believe any have better than <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub> odds of winning, but <strong>Reed Sheppard</strong> represents some value at +650. Let&rsquo;s bet half our stack on him. Let&rsquo;s also throw $2 on <strong>Ja&rsquo;Kobe Walter</strong> as a fun 100:1 long shot bet. If you win that, you can brag to your friends for years and write long-winded columns like you&rsquo;re an expert.</p>

<p>With the remainder of our money, let&rsquo;s go with my favorite pick on the board in Chicago SF <strong>Matas Buzelis</strong> (+1200). As the # 11 pick, Buzelis would defy our historical trends. Still, Buzelis isn&rsquo;t the ordinary # 11 pick. Some sites projected him at # 1 overall until he had a clunky year in the G-League.</p>

<p>Going forward, I like his skill set and his opportunity here in Chicago. At 6&rsquo;10&rdquo;, Buzelis has a variety of skills: he can block shots, he can distribute. His only glaring flaw in the G-League was his shot (27.3% from deep), but it <em>looks</em> okay from an &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; aesthetic to me. Buzelis also has a fairly open lane with the Bulls. Losing DeMar DeRozan and Alex Caruso will open up a combined 66.5 minutes per game. If the Bulls embrace a youth movement (finally), Buzelis may be able to come in and average about <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>, which may be enough to win ROY in this draft class. Logically it makes more sense to bet on an older rookie like Dalton Knecht instead, but Buzelis may have more of a chance to be a leading scorer for his team.</p>

<p>To be honest, I may be biased here: like Matas Buzelis, my family are Lithuanians who relocated to Chicago. But if he can have a good season, he&rsquo;s going to be a homegrown hero for a lot of despondent Bulls fans, too.</p>
