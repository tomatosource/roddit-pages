Him being a taller and heavier guard is beneficial in a lot of match ups. Yeah sure he can have issues with cardio but he is also putting his team on his back 90 percent of the time.</p>

      <label for="lkwunm8" class="commentText"><p>the extra girth and strength is definitely good for his game but there’s a balance. for whatever reason listed player weights don’t typically get updated by teams but he was listed at 230 as a rookie and now he’s thought to be like 260 IIRC, that’s way too much weight gain</p>

<p>he could stand to regain some of his old agility, improve his stamina, and lessen the stress on his lower body while still maintaining the advantages of his extra size, if he dropped like 10-12 lb imo</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that his added strength has helped him with his lowpost game and backing down smaller guards, but is it any surprise he&rsquo;s played ~60 games a year and dealt with nagging ankle and knee injuries? Is it a surprise that he takes entire defensive possessions off to catch his breath?  A Luka that is in between the current version and the slimness we saw in seasons 1 and 2 would be ideal.</p>

      <label for="lkw9f3s" class="commentText"><p>I just think it&rsquo;s beating a dead horse. Like what you get from luka now is pretty good too, and he doesn&rsquo;t seem like he&rsquo;s ever gonna change that frame for whatever reason, and it&rsquo;s not even in the top 5 mavs problems now, so why keep complaining about it? And like it&rsquo;s at least debatable him being this big is beneficial to his game, so why keep mentioning he was so skinny in his rookie season while he&rsquo;s clearly better now?</p>

      <label for="lkwcbd6" class="commentText"><p>I think the weight is just the most visibly obvious way to sum up Luka&rsquo;s issues. He has moments on defense where he&rsquo;s not engaged, he can look like a cone with his effort, at times he looks gassed, and his constant complaining to refs is concerning.</p>

<p>Is his weight the core issue? No, but it&rsquo;s all these easy to observe things that point to a lack of discipline. And complaining about the weight is, at least to me, is just a way to say &ldquo;tighten it up&rdquo; across the board. He&rsquo;s one of the best in the league and I would love to see him be better.</p>

      <label for="lkwbc7a" class="commentText"><p>His career is going to be cut short unless he’s able to maintain a better level of conditioning. It’s absolutely a weakness in his game, particularly when it comes to the playoffs. During most of the regular season he’s one of the worst defensive players in the entire league, when he is capable of much better. You gotta understand that it’s pure cope pretending like it isn’t a problem.</p>

      <label for="lkwkfsl" class="commentText"><p>How do people post shit that is just straight up wrong so confidently?</p>

<p>Like you just obviously don&rsquo;t pay attention if you think Luka during the regular season is &ldquo;one of the worst defensive players in the league&rdquo;, so why comment at all? Mavs had one of the best defenses in the league last season especially in the second half of the season, and Luka was a big part of that. I know that the last thing seared into everyone&rsquo;s mind is Luka (on one knee) getting cooked by the Celtics in the finals so that&rsquo;s how everyone is going to discuss him, but an entire season of basketball took place before that lol. Luka isn&rsquo;t a great defender (also carries the biggest offensive burden in the league but I digress) but for 95% of this season he ranged from decent to very good on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Why make stuff up?</p>

      <label for="lkwg7av" class="commentText"><p>By what metric he&rsquo;s one of the worst defensive players in the league? The conditioning thing is also stupid when he played the most minutes last season if you count playoffs. Like if his conditioning is bad what about others? Donovan Mitchell, Tyrese Haliburton, Zion Williamson couldn&rsquo;t even sustain in playoffs, Anthony Edwards was so gassed he had to inhale oxygen, Nikola Jokic was so gassed he was shooting abysmal on 3s, why Luka get singled out when he&rsquo;s the one who had to play the entire second half constantly in the regular season? Because he looks chubby and out of breath at times?</p>
