      <label for="lkzaik9" class="commentText"><p>For comparison, by the end of their age 24 seasons, Luka and LeBron had played 13,943 and 19,142 minutes respectively. Luka had also played 3,441 senior pro minutes in Europe across EuroLeague and Liga ACB, for a total of 17,384 minutes. *Regular season minutes only.</p>

<p>Despite turning pro 2 years later than Luka, LeBron actually played 1,758 more minutes by the time he was Luka&rsquo;s current age. Which isn&rsquo;t a shot at Luka (who has played a ridiculous amount of elite level basketball for a 25 year old) but it illustrates just how crazy LeBron&rsquo;s career has been.</p>

<p>By age 24 (6 seasons), LeBron had 40% more minutes than Joel Embiid&rsquo;s entire career (8 active seasons), 74% of Giannis&rsquo; career minutes (11 seasons), 87% of Kawhi&rsquo;s career minutes (12 seasons) and 10% more minutes than the first 7 years of fellow early starter Jayson Tatum. The fact that he&rsquo;s gone on to play another 37,455 minutes <em>after</em> that is&hellip; just unreal. Even MJ, who played 15 seasons, led the league in mpg 3 times and played over 3000 minutes in 12 seasons, only played 72% of LeBron&rsquo;s career minutes. We might truly never see another player like him.</p>

      <label for="ll08gor" class="commentText"><p>Well that depends, are we including international ball? The comment I responded to said &ldquo;pro basketball&rdquo; and international competition isn&rsquo;t professional. But if you want to include those international minutes as well then that adds 1,363 minutes for Slovenia vs 508 for LeBron on Team USA.</p>

<p>In that case we should also include NBA playoff minutes, which are 1,948 for Luka vs 2,629 for LeBron (Euroleague and Liga ACB tournament minutes were included in my initial calculation).</p>

<p>Making their age 24 season totals 20,695 vs 22,279 for LeBron - still 1,584 more minutes than Luka.</p>

      <label for="lkz9mwk" class="commentText"><p>Yea like I hit against this narrative pretty often so i’m sure people think i’m just a coping Luka stan lol, but i’d actually love for him to find a middle ground between the rookie season and where he is now too lol, especially since this roster can run a lot more.</p>

<p>I just disagree heavily with the idea that it makes him not fit to play and injured lol</p>

<p>But I think his biggest demon no matter what the weight is whatever happens after he picks up a more serious injury, cause that’s usually when things go south for him weight and wind wise</p>

Every season has been the same, he starts looking the best he has been, gets a more serious injury, then gains weight and you all act like he’s been fat all season lmao, it’s dumb as hell.</p>

<p>And since he’s been getting the same injuries at every weight you don’t see how it looks wild to say the weight is the problem lol?</p>

<p>He literally just grew into his genes (literally just look at his dad) and also decided to play heavier the last couple seasons, he could decide to play lighter and all it’s gonna do is optimize him for if he wants to play faster. It’s not like he wasn’t fit enough for a whole season, he proved that last season and every other one besides two seasons ago lol.</p>

<p>we dont have elite scorer pre-kyrie, so getting him in the post is one of easiest way to generate points rather than playing full speed 48 minutes. and he&rsquo;s efficient af in the post with combined strength and skill</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s why i bet and hope Luka changes a bit next season because now he&rsquo;s not only scorer in this team</p>

<p>like next season is good situation to make him to be more a passer than scorer. if he&rsquo;s 34/9ast last season, i dont mind him getting <sup>28</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> next season</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m guessing from your name/flair that you&rsquo;re pretty committed to finding a &ldquo;Luka bad&rdquo; angle. Can&rsquo;t help but wonder if you&rsquo;ll be one of those mfs in 15 years posting &ldquo;I wish I would have enjoyed this guy&rsquo;s career while he was in his prime instead of hating the whole time.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s up to you.</p>

He could still weigh <sup>240</sup>&frasl;<sub>250</sub> and be more muscular and bully the hell out of smaller players.</p>

<p>Just because he is a great player doesn’t mean he can’t improve.</p>

<p>Still a really strong dude and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be negatively affecting his game,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite the contrary, it positjvely impacts it since he can dominate players in the post and acore more points. He had to gain mass in order to achieve more points, which he did compared to his rookie season while not massively improving his 3pt% (correct me if im wrong). He couldnt have done that without being heavier.</p>

<p>Is he too heavy now? Maybe a few kilos. But it is by design and not because he is lazy.</p>

      <label for="lkz3lyn" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s such a stupid argument. Yes, Luka&rsquo;s game has evolved, that&rsquo;s what usually happens as players gain experience in the league. But that does <em>not</em> mean his body isn&rsquo;t holding him back to a certain extent. If he was more fit with the craftiness and experience he has now, he would probably be even better than nowadays. Less injuries, more options at the rim, more speed, etc. For all we know, he could already be an MVP with a ring if he was in shape.</p>

You think he is backing people down at this rate looking this lean? Dude is a bucket in the post and you can argue his weight allows him to play through contact he gets all the time with his style.</p>

<p>Your argument is just what-about-ism bullshit. The man led a trash roster to the WCF a couple years ago and made the finals with an improved roster last year. He also led the league in scoring and has been in the MVP mix for years, but yeah totally if he lost 15 pounds he would have rings and an MVP.</p>

<p>Argue his attitude or his heliocentric nature and I can see the argument more but the weight is just peak r/NBA garbage takes.</p>

<p>Nobody said it was an enlightening observation. Most people don&rsquo;t actively go back and watch him in his rookie year so they often forget just how different he looked and just how quick and agile he actually was. This thread is perfect evidence of that.</p>

      <label for="lkwb0v5" class="commentText"><p>Idk I feel like an underrated part of his game is his ability to move his weight around and force himself to the basket. Him being a taller and heavier guard is beneficial in a lot of match ups. Yeah sure he can have issues with cardio but he is also putting his team on his back 90 percent of the time.</p>

      <label for="lkwunm8" class="commentText"><p>the extra girth and strength is definitely good for his game but there’s a balance. for whatever reason listed player weights don’t typically get updated by teams but he was listed at 230 as a rookie and now he’s thought to be like 260 IIRC, that’s way too much weight gain</p>

<p>he could stand to regain some of his old agility, improve his stamina, and lessen the stress on his lower body while still maintaining the advantages of his extra size, if he dropped like 10-12 lb imo</p>

      <label for="lky0q7k" class="commentText"><p>Of course he was always dominant, but he was most dominant when he was fat AF but his fatness hadn&rsquo;t caught up to his knees yet. He was inhumanly huge when he was most unguardable. Ignoring his fatness when it comes to his dominance is ignoring part of his story. Yes he was dominant when he wasn&rsquo;t fat, and yes at a certain point he got way too fat, but there&rsquo;s a reason his most dominant prime was very short.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about career length that&rsquo;s one thing but Shaq is basically the greatest example of putting on weight directly correlating with increased dominance.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that his added strength has helped him with his lowpost game and backing down smaller guards, but is it any surprise he&rsquo;s played ~60 games a year and dealt with nagging ankle and knee injuries? Is it a surprise that he takes entire defensive possessions off to catch his breath?  A Luka that is in between the current version and the slimness we saw in seasons 1 and 2 would be ideal.</p>

<p>Barring injury he should hopefully win one this upcoming season. The difference between the first half team and post trade deadline team is insane. With klay,on paper it should work out.</p>

      <label for="lkxhomb" class="commentText"><p>I think part of the reason he&rsquo;s so dominant is because of his height and weight. Tallish pg that can bully people to score if need be is sorta an uncommon player. Unique I guess id say. I&rsquo;m gonna bring up klay again because I think his APG can go up with him. He&rsquo;s a way better upgrade than Hardaway Jr that most mavs fans have had to watch the last few years. No shade on thj, that dude made some games bearable to watch throughout his tenure</p>

He has played 84% of available regular season games, which is equivalent to 69 games in an 82 game season, obviously much closer to 70 than 60 if you&rsquo;re rounding. He has played 94% of available playoff games.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can’t just scale up the shortened seasons and assume he’s going to play the same ratio of games. The end of the season are the games he is most likely to miss because he will be tired/worn and they will have more motivation to rest him before the off season.</p></li>

<li><p>You’re bringing his rookie season into this to inflate the average when the entire point of this conversation is how he’s gotten fat since he rookie season and hasn’t been able to play as many games. Go figure, Luka played the most games of his career in his rookie season before he got fat, I wonder why.</p></li>

      <label for="ll0druv" class="commentText"><p>I think what we learn from this is that dumbing it down to &ldquo;60 game player&rdquo; or &ldquo;70 game player&rdquo; are both faulty labels, and neither properly capture the context of a career.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that scaling up shortened seasons may not provide a completely accurate picture, but using those played-game totals in your mental average without accounting for the shortened season is an even worse compromise, I would argue. If you&rsquo;re that committed to splitting hairs, you could also acknowledge that in his season two years ago, the team rested him during games he could have played because they weren&rsquo;t going to make the playoffs and wanted a better pick. But I believe that you have already decided the conclusion you want to come to.</p>

<p>If you toss his rookie year because he was young, toss the next two seasons because there&rsquo;s no accurate way to predict the outcome of games that weren&rsquo;t played, ignore the likely scenario that he plays more games two years ago if the Mavs weren&rsquo;t ass, you&rsquo;re left with 65, 66, 70. Average is 67 games across the only 3 seasons you and I can agree on how to account for. So again, if you&rsquo;re dead-set on rounding, that&rsquo;s still closer to 70. It&rsquo;s also above the 65-game limit for regular season awards, and it&rsquo;s also a 3-season sample size, and I don&rsquo;t think tells us a lot either way. Those 3 seasons included a healthy run to the WCF and an injured run to the finals.</p>

<p>All in all, I don&rsquo;t believe he has been as consistently derailed by injuries over the last few seasons as you&rsquo;re implying.</p>

      <label for="ll0f612" class="commentText"><p>I never said derailed by injuries, but yes his injuries and poorer conditioning do hurt him over time. I would say that his injury was a big factor in his finals loss, so missing out on a ring is a pretty big deal, and my point goes further than over time this is only going to hurt his career more if he doesn’t fix it.</p>

<p>He’s a top 3-5 player in the world, but he could be a consensus top 1/2/3 player if he actually took his conditioning and health seriously. He could have a potential goat career, instead he may blunder that.</p>

He has moments on defense where he&rsquo;s not engaged, he can look like a cone with his effort, at times he looks gassed, and his constant complaining to refs is concerning.</p>

<p>Is his weight the core issue? No, but it&rsquo;s all these easy to observe things that point to a lack of discipline. And complaining about the weight is, at least to me, is just a way to say &ldquo;tighten it up&rdquo; across the board. He&rsquo;s one of the best in the league and I would love to see him be better.</p>

<p>Like you just obviously don&rsquo;t pay attention if you think Luka during the regular season is &ldquo;one of the worst defensive players in the league&rdquo;, so why comment at all? Mavs had one of the best defenses in the league last season especially in the second half of the season, and Luka was a big part of that. I know that the last thing seared into everyone&rsquo;s mind is Luka (on one knee) getting cooked by the Celtics in the finals so that&rsquo;s how everyone is going to discuss him, but an entire season of basketball took place before that lol. Luka isn&rsquo;t a great defender (also carries the biggest offensive burden in the league but I digress) but for 95% of this season he ranged from decent to very good on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Why make stuff up?</p>

      <label for="lkyl8c3" class="commentText"><p>Luka didn&rsquo;t range from decent to very good defensively, he ranged from decent to average, but yeah, definitely not one of the worst. He can make great defensive plays like steals and blocks, but over the course of a game his effort mostly goes into offense (understandably), so his sustained defensive performance just isn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s similar to current LeBron like that, and they both frequently got beat backdoor, got caught ball watching, didn&rsquo;t get back in transition, etc.. Still, they did enough and got enough steals/blocks/defensive rebounds to not be big defensive liabilities, and were obviously huge net positives considering their offensive contribution.</p>

<p>While not the perfect stat, I just checked Defensive Rating for 2023-24 regular season: Luka was ranked 336 of 572 listed players (DEF RTG 113.8, lower is better) and LeBron was ranked 327 (113.6). The same stat for 2024 playoffs Luka was 96th of 213 total players (109.4) and LeBron was 136th (113.2). Seems about right.</p>

Donovan Mitchell, Tyrese Haliburton, Zion Williamson couldn&rsquo;t even sustain in playoffs, Anthony Edwards was so gassed he had to inhale oxygen, Nikola Jokic was so gassed he was shooting abysmal on 3s, why Luka get singled out when he&rsquo;s the one who had to play the entire second half constantly in the regular season? Because he looks chubby and out of breath at times?</p>

<p>but even then, it&rsquo;s pretty clear he can be in much better shape, his rim attempts would probably go back to like that 20% range again then</p>

      <label for="lkyfrua" class="commentText"><p>The copium is too strong here. He&rsquo;s not a regular human who on average exercises less at 25 than 19. He&rsquo;s a 6&rsquo;8 pro athlete in the NBA who needs to eat probably over 5000 calories a day to maintain weight. He makes a conscious decision on what he&rsquo;s eating and it seems like he&rsquo;s not doing the most he possibly can to do it right. I don&rsquo;t know many players who went from looking lean like this to kind of chubby he doesn&rsquo;t need to be LeBron to not gain body fat.</p>

He would be much better if he took his fitness more seriously. I don&rsquo;t blame him, because I would probably be just as indifferent if what I was doing was working in the NBA, but there is no doubt that he&rsquo;d be an even better player if he took his fitness more seriously.</p>

<p>When he came in to the League he was still a child. He was still growing, while I will acknowledge he could have gained bulk with weights versus 2-20 pc chicken Mc nuggets for dinner, I will not discredit the advantage it has created for him in his position, to be thicka than a snicka</p>

<p>Were it an impairment to what his goals are, his ability to perform in his role,  surely it would have been addressed by now.</p>

<p>Folks say he carries the weight well&hellip; I disagree.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s so insanely skilled that he overcomes it.</p>

<p>Just like Steph really didn&rsquo;t get to the next level until.he got the cadaver tendon and realized &ldquo;oh shit here I am one of the greatest shooters ever on the edge of having an shortened career cuz I wasn&rsquo;t maxing out fitness&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Luka were as fitness minded as Steph Lebron or Giannis he&rsquo;d retire among the shortest lists of greats&hellip; but he&rsquo;s there with Kyrie dudes who are idiosyncratic and prefer to only focus on the art of the game.  It&rsquo;s such a shame tbh.  To each his own though.</p>

      <label for="lkzf7em" class="commentText"><p>These conversations always make me laugh.  The fans of the player just rush in to justify regardless of what they really believe or see.      Does Luka’s weight and lack of peak conditioning affect his defense?   Of course it does.   What about does the extra weight make injury more common?  Of course it does.   Will carrying around an extra 30lbs shorten his career long term?  Yes it will.      Same arguments in the Zion and Embid subs.   Embid gets hurt all the time. Do you think his extra 30 lbs affects that?   Nope no way.     What about Zion ?   Nope the fact he’s 330 lbs has nothing to do with his injuries.     Of course they do.</p>

<p>It’s a lack of commitment to the peak peak levels and what keeps these players from reaching that level.  Lebron James  and steph curry 101.   Year around fitness and diet and conditioning. You think lebron’s 25 year career is an accident or luck ?  Minimal injuries the most minutes points and games played ever.   Come on now.   It’s part of their job and the reason why teams put weight clauses in contracts.  Luka just doesn’t have the level of year round commitment it takes to get there. Embid was woefully out of shape at the Olympics this year.  Like laughably.   Tell me he can’t get more serious and commit.   Zion has such great potential that someone has to get thru to him.   His 5 minutes are almost up without any real accomplishment.   If you are being honest this is obvious.</p>
