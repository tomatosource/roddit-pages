<p>Everyone was a year older</p>

<p>Yeah including two of your stars who were still getting better with age and experience. Kyrie was much better in 16-17 than he was the year before and Love was also tangibly better.</p>

<p>And, importantly, Love was also better in the 16-17 playoffs than he was the prior year. LeBron is obviously an outlier in every sense but he had a 65% TS in the 2017 playoffs as compared to 59% the 2016 playoffs.</p>

<p>The Cavs playoff defense was good. They didn’t care about regular season and had no reason to. But they were good in the playoffs.</p>

<p>You have to remember they played 5 games against the most talented team of all time. In those playoffs, the average DRTG was 111. Through the ECF, the Cavs defense was at a 108 DRTG. Significantly better than average. The issue was they had a laughable 120 DRTG against the Warriors and that’s just on the fact that KD joined a 73-win team.</p>

<p>-lob threat big who can also provide resistance as the last line of defense</p>

<p>We had none of that. We were putting Richard Jefferson who would retire like 2 years later on fucking KD.</p>

<p>Yeah we had enough to steamroll the east but in those days you dont measure yourself based on the east. You only measure yourself on how do you counter the warriors. And we countered horribly</p>

Okay, sure, he lost to the Warriors, it feels cheap. But it’s not like we’d ever ask a team to intentionally take a worse player or refuse a better player. I’m not sure how other teams also wanting to take KD changes the fact Golden State also chose a super team? KD’s choice is shittier and larger im just saying they can share like 10% of this.</p>

      <label for="l6rx85i" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re right, really the issue is max salaries. The salary cap should exist but if we wanted to fully avoid something like this, max contracts shouldnt. With the exception of being able to offer players enough to field a team (so like 11*min contract), someone should be able to get the rest of the cap. KD was willing to sacrifice a little but I doubt he would&rsquo;ve joined the warriors if he could&rsquo;ve made like 130 mil somewhere else (or whatever ludicrous amount it would&rsquo;ve been). The sheer scale of the contracts would be extremely tough to then convince players to turn them down in favor of making a super team. But obviously the players union would never agree and neither should they. It would screw over everyone but superstars. But I do kind of wish the league was this way</p>

      <label for="l6ryew5" class="commentText"><p>I appreciate your more macro view of this. Yeah, the issue is that with the right salary cap conditions, money can’t lure players away from just playing with other superstars. Of course, this has sort of transitioned to happening via trades and made it less effective to do the super team thing. So maybe we’re already seeing a natural if temporary fix.</p>

<p>You can think whatever you want about them or if you think they’d easily lose in a game 7 I really don’t care. But facts are the only games 7s he’s lost are to prime Lebron as a rookie and a game he got injured the first play.</p>

Everyone just seems so childish and petty who does this. Believe it or not but Boston bussing crisis people from 50 years ago and Irish riviera republicans from the south shore don’t really represent the modern Celtics fan base. Massachusetts is more progressive than like 95% of states lol.</p>

<p>It’s also rich coming from fans of teams from Texas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Indiana etc. where there was WAY more registered hate groups and legit racial tension</p>

<p>Southern California is filled with neo nazi groups. Philly caused a nationwide training at Starbucks for calling the cops on a black guy for sitting in their store. They had droves of proud boys walking around during the George Floyd protests with bats…</p>

      <label for="l6rycm8" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s kind of remarkable how little basketball people on this sub have <em>heard</em> of, let alone watched. People are in comments literally saying Kyrie is better than Tatum when a worse version of these Celtics swept the KD/Kyrie Nets just a couple years ago.</p>

<p>You can see it in game threads - people legit expect zero foul calls in entire quarters, and complain about how boring &ldquo;refball&rdquo; is the second any call is made. Like, most of the comments legitimately only make sense if the people making them haven&rsquo;t watched an actual NBA basketball game before. It&rsquo;s really weird.</p>

      <label for="l6rna11" class="commentText"><p>That doesn’t make sense. The first person said the Celtics are guaranteed to lose in game 7. The response was that the Celtics are 5-2 in game 7’s. Now, you’re changing the discussion and saying they shouldn’t have made it to game 7, it should have been done earlier? Sounds like weirdly moving the goal posts to just hate on Tatum.</p>

<p>Is Tatum as good as Kobe/Shaq/Duncan? No wtf kinda conversation is this. He’s not a top 10 place of all time so why are we comparing them. Also off the top of my head, 5 of the game 7’s Tatum has even played in are against (1) Giannis, (2) Embiid + Harden + Maxey, and (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>) the Heat, one of which was in 2022 when the heat were the 1 seed, and (5) Lebron and the Cavs when Tatum was 19 and the best player on that playoffs Celtics.</p>

<p>It’s hard to disparage a guy for playing game 7’s and winning all but two of those, against those teams…</p>

<p>Jordan gets much more credit for losing before the Finals than LBJ gets for losing in the Finals.  So yes, it is probably better to lose before game 7.</p>

<p>This guys agrees with this take, btw. So there&rsquo;s likely no reason to try and fix him.</p>

      <label for="l6rpglu" class="commentText"><p>It was just pointing out that he has played in unusually high amount of game 7s compared to other multiple time All-NBA players (especially given his age).  Before this playoffs started he has won as many series in 7 games as he had won in less than 7 games (5-5).</p>

<p>But it certainly seems like I struck a nerve with Celtic fans.  Going to be a long series for you guys if you are this defensive about everything.</p>

<p>Jordan only played in 3 game 7s his whole career. He also got swept, and played in an era where game 7s didn&rsquo;t exist in the first round.</p>

<p>Is it somehow better to get eliminated before a game 7?</p>

      <label for="l6rty0v" class="commentText"><p>And honestly, the 2016 Finals wasn&rsquo;t that good of a series. It was very compelling narratively, but the first six games were all huge blowouts with the lowest margin of victory being 11 points. Game 7 was the only good game in the series.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since we&rsquo;ve had a truly epic Finals with lots of good games. You gotta go back to 2013 where Games 1, 6, and 7 were all classics.</p>

      <label for="l6rwqgx" class="commentText"><p>2005 deserves a shoutout. It is a classic example of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a series until a road team wins&rdquo;. Both home teams won comfortably to get to 2-2, and then each of the last 3 games were all-out battles with each team taking a road win before game 7. Also was an end-of-an-era type finals, the last one before Bron rose to the throne.</p>

Most series are not that close, one team has an advantage and wins in less games. This finals won’t go 7 games it’s pretty lopsided in actuality. Celtics should win in 5 give or take a game.</p>
