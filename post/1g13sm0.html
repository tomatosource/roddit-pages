</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Was bored tonight, so ended up watching the ‘92 dream team vs Brazil game twice, back to back. It was actually my first time ever watching a full dream team game, and I took some notes. Very good game, it’s on the Olympics YouTube channel for anyone interested.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>[ ] Barkley the best player on the floor. Just unstoppable. Also has this funny habit of pointing out the player that fouled him to the ref.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Jordan very flashy passer, seriously almost all his passes look athletic, but also has bad turnovers. The best athlete, the body control is just different. Seems like he can get to the rim at will, that hang dribble, stutter step move looks OP vs Brazil. He also weirdly struggles with his finishing and shooting. The Brazil pg had no chance bringing the ball up. Jordan just waits for him to make a move, then teleports in front of him. Another way to look at it is that the Brazil PG’s conditioning is actually impressive, considering what he had to do just to be able to bring the ball up and get a pass off with Jordan pestering him.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Ewing and Robinson hit a few short mid range jumpers, both also ran the floor well in transition. Malone kind of looks like embiid in some of those mid range fades.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Mullins just gets open threes all game long, keeps draining them, and Brazil never adjusts to challenge those. It’s jarring watching him just drain open shot after open shot all ages until the game ends. Conversely, he just gives up foul after foul on the defensive end.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Pippen’s arms are long. Defending a guy out at the three, but can still reach down to help near the key. Slides his feet incredibly well, just looks imperious defensively. Also very good transition passing and scoring. There’s a move in transition where he goes behind the back, around a player, then into the paint, and with one defender to beat, he does that Rondo behind the back fake to go around the Brazil player and lay it in, very impressive. Also very noticeable chemistry with Jordan defensively, they flow so well.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] USA bigs look passably switchable, though not sure if the switch-ability is due to Brazil’s inability to punish the switches. Robinson struggles with fouls contesting shots and containing in space, the other 2 fair better, tho Ewing rarely venture out of the paint. Also, Ewing not the best defensive awareness. Gets burned on cuts a few times. The paint is completely walled off to Brazil all game long.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Brazil takes a lot of 3s. Some flare screens, strong/weak side actions, pick and roll, pick and pop, pushing in transition, transition pull up 3, off the dribble 3s, coming off screens for 3s, think I even saw a relocation 3. Semblances of a modern offense, not enough talent. Their defense looks bad though. They don’t seem to know whether they’re supposed to double or not sometimes, the communication is bad.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Brazil #6 looks like he’s out here to prove a point. Very aggressive and fouling on defense. Shoots anything he can on offense. Hits his first three which he takes as a green light, then proceeds to brick almost every other shot he takes, bricks his free throws as well. There’s a shot attempt he has at around 40:52 mins into the video that’s one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. Has a very impressive transition push, showing decent handles, but bricks the open lay up so hard.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Bird very good shooter, hits some 3’s. Great use of the touch pass to create transition opportunities. Struggles with fouls, and literally lays on the floor on the sidelines the entire game, when he’s not playing. Magic doesn’t play but gets a huge cheer every time he’s shown. Laettner does not belong on the floor with the others.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Brazil wants to use the dribble drive to set up their offense. Lots of cuts, give and gos, some guard to guard actions. Problem for them is that Jordan and pippen are on the perimeter, paint is walled off, and they don’t have enough shooting, so basically overmatched. USA on the other hand plays either in transition, or post entry and swing. Wonder how if it would look different with a real point guard on the floor for team USA. Jordan is the only one that even tries to penetrate from the perimeter, Clyde a bit too. Both teams really crash the offensive glass, and both really push in transition. Any miss and the other team are flying down the other end to get a shot off.</p></li>
