      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f27fno/quick_history_of_the_shot_clock_design/"><p>Quick History of the Shot Clock Design</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Itâ€™s the offseason and thereâ€™s nothing better to talk about. I saw somebody ask this question a few weeks ago in this sub, and I wanted to make a quick detailed history about it.</p>

<p>Before the transparent shot clocks that we see today, NBA teams used whatever they wanted. Some used shot clocks that only had one side for the players to see, while others used triangular shaped ones for people in the crowd to see as well.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the NBA didnâ€™t have a standardized design for shot clocks, so every arena could use whatever they wanted. In 1974, the NBA began requiring teams to install red lightbulbs on their backboards or shot clocks. This was done to visually signal when the game clock hit zero, making it clear when a period or game ended. This was the norm until 2002, when controversy struck.</p>

<p>A bunch of controversial moments in the 2002 playoffs forced the NBA to make big changes. Think of Reggie Millerâ€™s game tying 3 vs the Nets that shouldnâ€™t have counted, Samaki Walkerâ€™s deep 3 vs the Kings in game 4 that was late but counted (a game the Lakers later won by 1 thanks to Robert Horry), or Baron Davisâ€™ game winner vs the Magic that was wrongly waived off. Video replay after a buzzer beater wasnâ€™t a thing before 2002, and the small lightbulbs that they used back then certainly didnâ€™t help either. The following season, in conjunction with the newly added instant replay, the NBA ordered every team to start using â€˜cube shapedâ€™ shot clocks (along with LED strips behind the backboard), as they were easier for refs to tell if a shot was released in time. It also made it easier for players and fans in the arena to keep track of time, instead of looking at the jumbotron. The Cavs, Warriors, Rockets and eventually the Bobcats (when they joined the league) were the only 4 teams that were still using the old lightbulb technology. The Cavs, Warriors &amp; Rockets made the switch in the 2003-04 season, while the Bobcats (now Hornets) used the old clock briefly until 2005-06.</p>

<p>The â€˜flat transparentâ€™ shot clocks we know of today were first introduced in the 2004-05 season by the Grizzlies, when they moved into the FedEx Forum. Created by Daktronics, this new technology was revolutionary in changing the game experience, as you had two transparent clocks on the hoop stanchion (one facing the length of the court, and the other facing the baselines). Not only that, but the borders of this new shot clock were built-in with red LED strips, that would light up when the game clock reached zero. Over time, teams slowly phased out the cube shot clocks for the clear monitor ones, with most of them making the switch in the 2008-09 season. The Nuggets, Kings, Warriors, Wolves and Pistons were the last teams to use the cube clocks in 2010-11, before they completely made the switch at the start of the 2011-12 season. During the 2011-12 season, the Daktronics were updated to show tenths of a second whenever the 24 second timer went below 5 seconds.</p>

<p>After the 2016 finals, the NBA switched from Daktronics to Tissot, the provider of the shot clocks that we see today. They were noticeably bigger and more transparent than their Daktronics counterparts, enhancing the fan experience. The Tissot shot clocks show a red countdown timer during timeouts (to show how long a timeout is) below the logo. All NBA teams switched to this new shotclock at the start of the 2016-17 season.</p>

<p>Sometime in early 2024, Tissot made a slight tweak to their shot clock, making the numbers on the clock appearing more boxy, and the LED strips stopping before the Tissot logo instead of overlapping it.</p>

<p>The year each NBA team switched from cube shot clocks to transparent ones:</p>

<p>2004: Grizzlies</p>

<p>2005: Hornets (previously Bobcats)</p>

<p>2006: Hawks, Celtics</p>

<p>2007: Wizards, Blazers, Knicks, Sixers, Mavs</p>

<p>2008: Raptors, Bulls, Heat, Suns, Cavs, Nets, Pacers, Pelicans (previously Hornets)</p>

<p>2009: Lakers (early 09), Jazz, Rockets, Spurs, Thunder</p>

<p>2010: Clippers, Magic, Bucks</p>

<p>2011: Warriors, Nuggets, Wolves, Pistons, Kings</p>
