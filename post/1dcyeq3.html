<p>You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to rotate after getting blown by. You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to box out. You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to simply attempt a basic close out. He does literally none of these things on nearly every possession</p>

<p>Idk about Kobe and MJ, but LeBron has had a lot of playoff runs in which he had to take rests on defense.</p>

<p>The Celtics have been able to take advantage of the Mavs in ways other teams can’t. Great combo of basketball IQ, dog, and skill with our top 8.</p>

      <label for="l81ueb4" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re nitpicking his examples and not his argument. Acting like Luka is the only offense is also disingenuous considering he&rsquo;s got Kyrie, who also copiloted a chip with Lebron and is considered better offensively than Pippen or Pau. Giannis did it on both ends with Kris Middleton as his sidekick. Hakeen did it on both ends with a washed Drexler and motley crue of role players.  Duncan always played both ends of the court.</p>

<p>His main point is &ldquo;People want to compare Luka to the greats I don&rsquo;t see why he should get a pass for making his team play 4 on 5 on that end&rdquo; and that point is valid.</p>

<p>It’s time to just firstly credit the Celtics for being easily the best team in the league. But also recognize that Luka has a lot of deficiencies on both ends of the court tbh. His defense is obviously atrocious but his offense actually could be better which is hard to believe, if he just stopped standing around off ball.</p>

<p>Iso ball couldn’t win Harden a championship, I don’t think Luka will get one either. He needs to start playing without the ball in his hand on both ends.</p>

Nothing against the guy personally but Luka’s defense absolutely factors in when you evaluate him, particularly against the greats, who busted their ass on D. A large part of defense is effort, conditioning and fundamentals (not all of it of course but a signifcant portion). I just dont see the effort from Luka.</p>

      <label for="l827cfq" class="commentText"><p>What would be your source for the tailbone injury? He was never on the injury report, he explicitly denied it, and there were basically 0 non speculative reports about it. I think most people would concede that he might&rsquo;ve been injured if there was any official indication to it, but to just assume it because of bad play seems a bit unreasonable  to me.</p>

<p>Believe me, I&rsquo;d have 0 trouble with it if they actually said there was an issue. But to me he didn&rsquo;t really look injured,  he looked tired and just out of his game mentally. And that&rsquo;s ok, young player after a grueling 7 game series where he played amazing.</p>

      <label for="l82dee8" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s kind of my point tho, he&rsquo;s not just an absolute detriment to his team because he IS hideable. Just not against a busted team like the C&rsquo;s who literally have the best offensive rating in the history of the NBA. It&rsquo;s not exactly a huge knock against Luka or the Mavs that they&rsquo;re not defending well.</p>

<p>Luka’s shotmaking has been brilliant but he’s been dreadful in most other facets of the game</p>

<p>Tatum’s shotmaking has been dreadful but he’s been brilliant in most other facets of the game</p>

<p>overall I’d say neither one is playing great but neither one is playing awful, either. the difference has been the Celtics team defense and the way their spacing completely neutralizes the defensive scheme that got Dallas here</p>

      <label for="l81c2l8" class="commentText"><p>well you gotta account for the assists too, but I am planning to do a rewatch bc I’m curious exactly how much Luka gave up in this game</p>

<p>EDIT: counted 31 points Luka gave back (11 off turnovers, 20 off getting beaten defensively) compared with 55 points scored and assisted (+24 net). didn’t count any buckets that Boston got by taking advantage of Luka being the low man though and honestly, 4 of Luka’s assists were very generously credited to him</p>

<p>I will say that Luka was bad, but Derrick Jones Jr and the bigs were the worst culprits as far as getting beaten on the perimeter</p>

      <label for="l81l1fp" class="commentText"><p>In game one he literally had one assist. Blame injuries, blame conditioning(which poor conditioning does contribute to injuries), either way, he clearly can’t keep up with the celtics in this series and is playing far from his best, both defensively and offensively.</p>

<p>Defensively he has looked atrocious most plays, he just doesn’t have the energy to give because he needs to give his all offensively, but he has looked far from typical on offence too. Sure he still got 30 on good efficiency, but especially in game one I have never seen Luka so hesitant with his shot. He’ll make a move, and where he would normally make a tough bucket he will hesitate and pass it. Multiple plays I’ve seen him make a move, beat the defender, and then when he’s relatively wide open he will hesitate and pass it instead. He is clearly not playing to his regular standard.</p>

<p>I also think Jaylen Browns defence needs more praise, he has just been so fucking good. He must have watched hours and hours of tape in his week off because he has so much discipline guarding Luka and there were a number of plays where his patience totally outplayed Luka and Luka failed to draw a rip through foul that he usually gets like 100% of the time. I saw Luka like visibly frustrated/shook that his swing the ball low, rip through move didn’t work on Brown and it was just amazing to watch a player actually beat Luka on that move.</p>

      <label for="l819e4l" class="commentText"><p>I said the same thing in another thread. Tatum&rsquo;s playmaking has objectively been better, his defense obviously clears, more hustle plays, and significantly more impact on the boards as most of Luka&rsquo;s rebounds are just the team freebies or he gives up on a defensive rotation to try and secure it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think all of that makes up for the gap in ppg. Luka has 12 turnovers and 12 assists on the series.</p>

<p>Like both 1st quarters there have been times I’ve been really impressed by his defense (at least relative to expectations). But then as the game goes on it all goes to shit.</p>

<p>Makes sense, the dude is the entire offense. Any possession he’s not directly involved in seems to go badly and the Celtics are making him work for everything. It’s just not sustainable to be doing that, let alone play good defense on top.</p>

<p>This feels like a Boston specific thing though because of how they&rsquo;re playing offense. They&rsquo;ll screen to get the Mavs crossmatched, and if one of the Jays has the ball up top with a mismatch, Celtics are specifically putting Kyrie or Luka&rsquo;s man in the dunker spot so that they&rsquo;re forced to contest at the rim. Really interesting stuff by Joe imo, idk if other teams do this but I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone do it more than Boston this postseason</p>

<p>You had White, KP, and to a lesser extent Brown &amp; Tatum shooting from the top of the arc. You&rsquo;ve got Holiday, Horford and Hauser shooting from the corners.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got some solid 3&amp;D guys but all of our guys like the corner shot. Celtics have taken that away both games and all of a sudden it requires some houdini bullshit pass from Luka to even get a decent look from 3.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we&rsquo;ve gotta sprint all over the court because Boston can have a shooter posted up basically anywhere.</p>

<p>They did in small bursts and the results were horrible. The Mavs were shooting around 70% in the paint with Kat+Naz and less than 40% whrn Gobert is in the game. These teams have data analytics teams to assist the coaching staffs and the coaches decided that it was better having one of Naz and Rudy or KAT and Rudy around rather than having Naz and KAT at the same time.</p>

However, someone as bad a Luka on defense can make it nearly impossible for what is otherwise a good defensive team to put up any resistance. It all comes down to how well you can hide your poor defenders, if one guy is bad enough there’s just nothing you can do and the whole defense falls apart. Chain is only as strong as its weakest link kind of thing</p>

<p>This team is in the finals; it’s completely insane to say they can’t put up resistance. They’re losing to a significantly better roster while every player outside the team’s star is no showing, shooting a putrid 44% eFG. Forget the defense, your team isn’t winning no matter how good your defense is if the best 2 - 6 players in the series are all on one team. The Celtics with Doncic on a max instead of Tatum would demolish this Mavs team</p>

So you might suggest that they not be so aggressive with this approach, but the problem is they aren’t stopping the ball at the POA (as you say).  If they decide to not be as aggressive at the rim, then it a layup line and the result is infinitely worse.</p>

<p>At the end of be day, players play.  If the mavs can’t stay in front of the Celtics and the Celtics can stay in front of the mavs, there isn’t anything the mavs can do to prevent the inevitable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as black and white as you might imagine. The focus is not a constant for an athlete. You can&rsquo;t maintain super focus all game, especially if you are too tired. That goes also for Celtics - they are working their asses off on defense, seems like all their focus is there, and as a result their shooting suffers.</p>

      <label for="l81b2wb" class="commentText"><p>Luka&rsquo;s defense was terrible the past two games.  It&rsquo;s not only his inability to stay in front of his man, but his lack of effort that is the worst.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve seen Luka play this type of defense in the regular season, but he&rsquo;s shown he&rsquo;s capable of much better in previous playoff games.  This leads me to believe, that a large part of it is due to injuries along with not having the stamina to carry the Mavs on offense as well as expend energy on defense.</p>

<p>Injuries aside, Luka is a very large guy and unlike Lebron, MJ, Kawhi, Kobe and others in the past who carried big offensive loads yet played hard on defense, Luka doesn&rsquo;t look to be in top physical conditioning.</p>

<p>Once he’s out of the “young superstar” phase of his career and is just in the “superstar” phase, the scrutiny will start to ramp up, <em>especially</em> if they lose this series and if a big reason for it is his lack of defense/conditioning.</p>

<p>The Pacers were just 2nd in pace and the Celtics 19th so they had more chances to put up points.</p>

<p>And even then it was just an aside and then he went back to other series.</p>

<p>Usually makes a pod after every finals game, hasn&rsquo;t made any so far despite the 3 day break between game 1 and 2. Obviously he hates us.</p>

      <label for="l818rhk" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s bordering on delusion lol.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve uploaded about once every 4 days in the playoffs so naturally in the second round they made videos on the Nuggets-Wolves rollercoaster because that&rsquo;s what most people cared about.</p>

<p>They then made a video about the Mavs destroying the Wolves where Mavs fans are psychoanalyizing his vocal inflection to say that he hates them, when he always talks pretty monotone in the unscripted watchalong videos &amp; his podcast.</p>

<p>Before their finals preview, 2 of their previous 4 podcasts featured the Mavs pretty heavily. Over the last several years he&rsquo;s been nothing but positive on Luka Doncic on his podcast. Giving him his own tier in an under 25 ranking, constantly calling him an offensive great etc.</p>

<p>The delusion mostly comes from a video where he analyzed why Luka&rsquo;s on/off is the weakest of any player with multiple top 5 MVP finishes. It&rsquo;s delusional because he ends the video saying he&rsquo;s already one of the greatest offensive players of all time. The entire tone of the video was positive, people clearly just looked at the title and ran with it.</p>

<p>You can use the same argument to say that he hates the Celtics because we won 64 games and had the 4th highest net rating ever and before the finals we got <em>zero</em> traditional scripted videos this season and <em>zero</em> playoff videos. All we got were 2 watchalongs and 2 podcast clips lol.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and he typically releases an episode of his podcast after every finals game. He&rsquo;s done zero on the finals so far, and the Celtics are up 2-0. Clearly he hates the Celtics, right? He&rsquo;s obviously trying to avoid having to talk down on his favorite player Luka for a whole hour.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot of X’s and O’s being thrown around so I’m not surprised they hate Ben lol</p>

<p>There’s a highly upvoted post talking about how DJJ/PJ bringing up the ball and initiating plays is a problem—it’s literally an adjustment from game one to give Luka a second to breathe and try to get favorable cross matchups on the offensive end through PNR. Seeing him get pick-sixed in the backcourt by JB in game one, it was kind of evident Luka was being forced to do too much.</p>

      <label for="l81fd3c" class="commentText"><p>Which honestly surprises me since in my opinion the Mavericks&rsquo; best chance of winning this series is to turn it from the Celtics vs Luka and Kyrie into Tatum vs Luka.</p>

<p>As much as I love Tatum, he can 100% be baited into terrible shots. Think of him over relying on his spinning fade in the midrange which he maybe shoots 35% on instead of just rising up and shooting over the top of his man despite being 6&rsquo;9 with a near 7 foot wingspan, or how he often opts for his sidestep 3 when he&rsquo;s matched up with a big on the perimeter.</p>

<p>Right now the Mavs are daring Tatum to pick them apart with his passing and have the rest of the C&rsquo;s beat them, and he and the Celtics have very much done just that. Down 2-0 I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s time to change up your defensive strategy.</p>

      <label for="l81ml8m" class="commentText"><p>Mavs are definitely in a spot and I’m not sure how they get out of it. If they stay tight on the shooters and let Tatum and brown go one on one, that’ll also be a disaster because Celtics have been hunting Luka and kyrie tenaciously and neither of them are particularly good at navigating screens and getting over quickly. Unless they go under on Tatum and invite him to shoot? I know he’s a streaky shooter but I don’t know if guarding him like he’s Gianni’s is the answer lol</p>

<p>Boston has a multitude of defenders to throw at them and the issue is that Mavs don’t have the personnel to throw at brown and tatum. Porzingis being back and stretching the floor doesn’t even account for his ability to attack mismatches also. Tough situation overall and the more I think about it I don’t know how Mavs take more than 1 game without Luka and Kyrie going for 80 combined</p>

Then on the other end, Luka is just playing offense against 1:1 defenders with zero defense, because the Mavericks don&rsquo;t have an alternative to Luka scoring.</p>

The biggest thing is taking away the pick and roll with lively and gafford without having to give up corner threes. The Mavs are shooting worse (and taking fewer open shots) because they don’t get these easier looks.</p>
