<p>You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to rotate after getting blown by. You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to box out. You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to simply attempt a basic close out. He does literally none of these things on nearly every possession</p>

<p>The Celtics have been able to take advantage of the Mavs in ways other teams can’t. Great combo of basketball IQ, dog, and skill with our top 8.</p>

      <label for="l81ueb4" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re nitpicking his examples and not his argument. Acting like Luka is the only offense is also disingenuous considering he&rsquo;s got Kyrie, who also copiloted a chip with Lebron and is considered better offensively than Pippen or Pau. Giannis did it on both ends with Kris Middleton as his sidekick. Hakeen did it on both ends with a washed Drexler and motley crue of role players.  Duncan always played both ends of the court.</p>

<p>His main point is &ldquo;People want to compare Luka to the greats I don&rsquo;t see why he should get a pass for making his team play 4 on 5 on that end&rdquo; and that point is valid.</p>

      <label for="l82au20" class="commentText"><p>Thank you lol. Nothing against the guy personally but Luka’s defense absolutely factors in when you evaluate him, particularly against the greats, who busted their ass on D. A large part of defense is effort, conditioning and fundamentals (not all of it of course but a signifcant portion). I just dont see the effort from Luka.</p>

But watching him it seems to me at least that he has a hand in a majority of Celtics buckets when he&rsquo;s on the floor, even when he isn&rsquo;t the primary defender on the shot. Like enough that I think the amount he contributes for the celtics is, at the very least, real close in value to that 30/10/10</p>

He was never on the injury report, he explicitly denied it, and there were basically 0 non speculative reports about it. I think most people would concede that he might&rsquo;ve been injured if there was any official indication to it, but to just assume it because of bad play seems a bit unreasonable  to me.</p>

<p>Believe me, I&rsquo;d have 0 trouble with it if they actually said there was an issue. But to me he didn&rsquo;t really look injured,  he looked tired and just out of his game mentally. And that&rsquo;s ok, young player after a grueling 7 game series where he played amazing.</p>

Just not against a busted team like the C&rsquo;s who literally have the best offensive rating in the history of the NBA. It&rsquo;s not exactly a huge knock against Luka or the Mavs that they&rsquo;re not defending well.</p>

      <label for="l818s07" class="commentText"><p>it seems like the consensus is that Luka has been the best player in this series, but quite frankly the gap between Luka and Tatum hasn’t been as vast as the stats would make you believe</p>

<p>Luka’s shotmaking has been brilliant but he’s been dreadful in most other facets of the game</p>

<p>Tatum’s shotmaking has been dreadful but he’s been brilliant in most other facets of the game</p>

<p>overall I’d say neither one is playing great but neither one is playing awful, either. the difference has been the Celtics team defense and the way their spacing completely neutralizes the defensive scheme that got Dallas here</p>

      <label for="l81c2l8" class="commentText"><p>well you gotta account for the assists too, but I am planning to do a rewatch bc I’m curious exactly how much Luka gave up in this game</p>

<p>EDIT: counted 31 points Luka gave back (11 off turnovers, 20 off getting beaten defensively) compared with 55 points scored and assisted (+24 net). didn’t count any buckets that Boston got by taking advantage of Luka being the low man though and honestly, 4 of Luka’s assists were very generously credited to him</p>

<p>I will say that Luka was bad, but Derrick Jones Jr and the bigs were the worst culprits as far as getting beaten on the perimeter</p>

      <label for="l81l1fp" class="commentText"><p>In game one he literally had one assist. Blame injuries, blame conditioning(which poor conditioning does contribute to injuries), either way, he clearly can’t keep up with the celtics in this series and is playing far from his best, both defensively and offensively.</p>

<p>Defensively he has looked atrocious most plays, he just doesn’t have the energy to give because he needs to give his all offensively, but he has looked far from typical on offence too. Sure he still got 30 on good efficiency, but especially in game one I have never seen Luka so hesitant with his shot. He’ll make a move, and where he would normally make a tough bucket he will hesitate and pass it. Multiple plays I’ve seen him make a move, beat the defender, and then when he’s relatively wide open he will hesitate and pass it instead. He is clearly not playing to his regular standard.</p>

<p>I also think Jaylen Browns defence needs more praise, he has just been so fucking good. He must have watched hours and hours of tape in his week off because he has so much discipline guarding Luka and there were a number of plays where his patience totally outplayed Luka and Luka failed to draw a rip through foul that he usually gets like 100% of the time. I saw Luka like visibly frustrated/shook that his swing the ball low, rip through move didn’t work on Brown and it was just amazing to watch a player actually beat Luka on that move.</p>

There was one possession in the post where Brown was just sooo patient, and Luka did his low swing move that he can pretty much always draw a foul on, and Luka’s expression looked genuinely shocked that Brown didn’t fall for it because that move seems to work practically every time.</p>

      <label for="l819e4l" class="commentText"><p>I said the same thing in another thread. Tatum&rsquo;s playmaking has objectively been better, his defense obviously clears, more hustle plays, and significantly more impact on the boards as most of Luka&rsquo;s rebounds are just the team freebies or he gives up on a defensive rotation to try and secure it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think all of that makes up for the gap in ppg. Luka has 12 turnovers and 12 assists on the series.</p>

      <label for="l82aynd" class="commentText"><p>Not to take away from his overall performance because I do think Tatum has played well in spite of his scoring, I agree with you. There is not a single other star player in the league that could get away with shooting ~35% in the finals and not get crucified for it, much less still come out with a win. The reality is the that the Celtics are just a much deeper, better constructed team. They are stacked as fuck. Meanwhile, the Mavs are starting DJJ, who would be a bench player on any other team, and giving half of their center minutes to a 19 year old rookie. Swap Tatum and Luka and this wouldn&rsquo;t even be a conversation lol.</p>

<p>Like both 1st quarters there have been times I’ve been really impressed by his defense (at least relative to expectations). But then as the game goes on it all goes to shit.</p>

<p>Makes sense, the dude is the entire offense. Any possession he’s not directly involved in seems to go badly and the Celtics are making him work for everything. It’s just not sustainable to be doing that, let alone play good defense on top.</p>

<p>This feels like a Boston specific thing though because of how they&rsquo;re playing offense. They&rsquo;ll screen to get the Mavs crossmatched, and if one of the Jays has the ball up top with a mismatch, Celtics are specifically putting Kyrie or Luka&rsquo;s man in the dunker spot so that they&rsquo;re forced to contest at the rim. Really interesting stuff by Joe imo, idk if other teams do this but I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone do it more than Boston this postseason</p>

However, someone as bad a Luka on defense can make it nearly impossible for what is otherwise a good defensive team to put up any resistance. It all comes down to how well you can hide your poor defenders, if one guy is bad enough there’s just nothing you can do and the whole defense falls apart. Chain is only as strong as its weakest link kind of thing</p>

<p>This team is in the finals; it’s completely insane to say they can’t put up resistance. They’re losing to a significantly better roster while every player outside the team’s star is no showing, shooting a putrid 44% eFG. Forget the defense, your team isn’t winning no matter how good your defense is if the best 2 - 6 players in the series are all on one team. The Celtics with Doncic on a max instead of Tatum would demolish this Mavs team</p>

      <label for="l828c1e" class="commentText"><p>I think it helps that all your guys like different spots to post up for 3s.</p>

<p>You had White, KP, and to a lesser extent Brown &amp; Tatum shooting from the top of the arc. You&rsquo;ve got Holiday, Horford and Hauser shooting from the corners.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got some solid 3&amp;D guys but all of our guys like the corner shot. Celtics have taken that away both games and all of a sudden it requires some houdini bullshit pass from Luka to even get a decent look from 3.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we&rsquo;ve gotta sprint all over the court because Boston can have a shooter posted up basically anywhere.</p>

They were getting roasted on D with Gobert anyway so you might as well just go 5 out on O, open the paint for Ant drives and kickouts (since he sucks at the lob or dumpoff to the bigs inside the paint), and try to outscore them.</p>

      <label for="l824q54" class="commentText"><p>The mavs are in a damned if you do, damned if you don’t position.  On the one hand, they clearly are selling out to protect the rim.  So you might suggest that they not be so aggressive with this approach, but the problem is they aren’t stopping the ball at the POA (as you say).  If they decide to not be as aggressive at the rim, then it a layup line and the result is infinitely worse.</p>

<p>At the end of be day, players play.  If the mavs can’t stay in front of the Celtics and the Celtics can stay in front of the mavs, there isn’t anything the mavs can do to prevent the inevitable.</p>

<p>The bigger issue, as has always been the biggest issue with Luka’s defense, is his awareness when he’s off ball. I don’t understand how be makes crazy behing the back passes on offense, but has no idea what going on around him on defense sometimes</p>

I can concede the Exum pass specifically, but saying his awareness on his passes isn&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be is just a ridiculous take. Is there any single player in the league with better awareness? Maybe Jokic? That&rsquo;s literally it. I don&rsquo;t get how that can be overhyped. Dude led the league in scoring with 34 a game and most people would agree his passing is his most impressive quality.</p>

      <label for="l81b2wb" class="commentText"><p>Luka&rsquo;s defense was terrible the past two games.  It&rsquo;s not only his inability to stay in front of his man, but his lack of effort that is the worst.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve seen Luka play this type of defense in the regular season, but he&rsquo;s shown he&rsquo;s capable of much better in previous playoff games.  This leads me to believe, that a large part of it is due to injuries along with not having the stamina to carry the Mavs on offense as well as expend energy on defense.</p>

<p>Injuries aside, Luka is a very large guy and unlike Lebron, MJ, Kawhi, Kobe and others in the past who carried big offensive loads yet played hard on defense, Luka doesn&rsquo;t look to be in top physical conditioning.</p>

Uses his extra size and weight to bully defenders. he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that as effectively if he was very lean. he&rsquo;s just not the athletic specimen Lebron/MJ/Kawhi/Kobe was. He could improve his stamina/endurance tho for sure. I don&rsquo;t really remember Jokic getting gassed as much</p>

<p>Jokic lost like 10 lbs and came into camp in the best shape of his life and they won a chip and he was a pretty avg defender. Seems like Luka should probably take some notes.</p>

      <label for="l818g3m" class="commentText"><p>Literally 2 videos ago is the video where he was talking about how Mavs wrecked the Wolves defense with one play.</p>

<p>People are just salty as shit lol and have selective memory. Mavs sub was complaining about this dude when the Game 1 video was posted about how he never makes videos about the Mavs &hellip;.. when literally the previous video was showcasing their offense.</p>

<p>Go look how many videos this dude has made about Boston before the NBA finals btw; 4 months ago was the last one lol, and it was about the Nuggets/Celtics close finish. And you don&rsquo;t hear our fanbase whining about some podcaster who refuses to make videos about us. So damn silly.</p>

<p>And even then it was just an aside and then he went back to other series.</p>

<p>Usually makes a pod after every finals game, hasn&rsquo;t made any so far despite the 3 day break between game 1 and 2. Obviously he hates us.</p>

      <label for="l818rhk" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s bordering on delusion lol.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve uploaded about once every 4 days in the playoffs so naturally in the second round they made videos on the Nuggets-Wolves rollercoaster because that&rsquo;s what most people cared about.</p>

<p>They then made a video about the Mavs destroying the Wolves where Mavs fans are psychoanalyizing his vocal inflection to say that he hates them, when he always talks pretty monotone in the unscripted watchalong videos &amp; his podcast.</p>

<p>Before their finals preview, 2 of their previous 4 podcasts featured the Mavs pretty heavily. Over the last several years he&rsquo;s been nothing but positive on Luka Doncic on his podcast. Giving him his own tier in an under 25 ranking, constantly calling him an offensive great etc.</p>

<p>The delusion mostly comes from a video where he analyzed why Luka&rsquo;s on/off is the weakest of any player with multiple top 5 MVP finishes. It&rsquo;s delusional because he ends the video saying he&rsquo;s already one of the greatest offensive players of all time. The entire tone of the video was positive, people clearly just looked at the title and ran with it.</p>

<p>You can use the same argument to say that he hates the Celtics because we won 64 games and had the 4th highest net rating ever and before the finals we got <em>zero</em> traditional scripted videos this season and <em>zero</em> playoff videos. All we got were 2 watchalongs and 2 podcast clips lol.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and he typically releases an episode of his podcast after every finals game. He&rsquo;s done zero on the finals so far, and the Celtics are up 2-0. Clearly he hates the Celtics, right? He&rsquo;s obviously trying to avoid having to talk down on his favorite player Luka for a whole hour.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot of X’s and O’s being thrown around so I’m not surprised they hate Ben lol</p>

<p>There’s a highly upvoted post talking about how DJJ/PJ bringing up the ball and initiating plays is a problem—it’s literally an adjustment from game one to give Luka a second to breathe and try to get favorable cross matchups on the offensive end through PNR. Seeing him get pick-sixed in the backcourt by JB in game one, it was kind of evident Luka was being forced to do too much.</p>

      <label for="l81fd3c" class="commentText"><p>Which honestly surprises me since in my opinion the Mavericks&rsquo; best chance of winning this series is to turn it from the Celtics vs Luka and Kyrie into Tatum vs Luka.</p>

<p>As much as I love Tatum, he can 100% be baited into terrible shots. Think of him over relying on his spinning fade in the midrange which he maybe shoots 35% on instead of just rising up and shooting over the top of his man despite being 6&rsquo;9 with a near 7 foot wingspan, or how he often opts for his sidestep 3 when he&rsquo;s matched up with a big on the perimeter.</p>

<p>Right now the Mavs are daring Tatum to pick them apart with his passing and have the rest of the C&rsquo;s beat them, and he and the Celtics have very much done just that. Down 2-0 I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s time to change up your defensive strategy.</p>

We already saw him turn down a lot in Game 1 and then in Game 2 he may have overcompensated with the rim attempts. But it resulted in a ton of assists either way so he might just lean into that at this point</p>

      <label for="l81vadr" class="commentText"><p>Tatum is averaging 29 drives a game which is 10 more than he averaged in the ECF, in the regular season he only averaged 9 drives a game. The gameplan is clearly drive and kick as much as you can, I don’t hate the shots he took even tho he missed a bunch. Law of averages has to come into effect at some point</p>

      <label for="l81ml8m" class="commentText"><p>Mavs are definitely in a spot and I’m not sure how they get out of it. If they stay tight on the shooters and let Tatum and brown go one on one, that’ll also be a disaster because Celtics have been hunting Luka and kyrie tenaciously and neither of them are particularly good at navigating screens and getting over quickly. Unless they go under on Tatum and invite him to shoot? I know he’s a streaky shooter but I don’t know if guarding him like he’s Gianni’s is the answer lol</p>

<p>Boston has a multitude of defenders to throw at them and the issue is that Mavs don’t have the personnel to throw at brown and tatum. Porzingis being back and stretching the floor doesn’t even account for his ability to attack mismatches also. Tough situation overall and the more I think about it I don’t know how Mavs take more than 1 game without Luka and Kyrie going for 80 combined</p>

The biggest thing is taking away the pick and roll with lively and gafford without having to give up corner threes.

      <label for="l8227m2" class="commentText"><p>Watched this a couple times and this video is kinda an encapsulation of issues I have with Ben Taylor lately. He shows at times this great analysis of picking up subtle things teams are focused on but then also buries that being overly focused on pushing an overarching narrative than just keeping to what actually happened in the cherry picked plays. Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>he talks about the constant switching guys like Tatum or brown onto smaller defenders (ie Kyrie or saying Luka cuz of his foot speed) but the Mavs have actually been in zone more than other schemes so there’s really only been a few instances where that’s true (I did like the brief touch on how Celtics have tried to rotate guards into being the rim defender but he didn’t show much on how they did that), which leads to</p></li>

<li><p>he talks about the blow bys which are eyes sores but again if it’s a zone defense with emphasis on the back line rim and paint defense because they know the 5 out defense will be hard to guard especially when at times there are 4+ true all star caliber type players on the floor at once. You can critique the effort to keep someone out of the paint but you can’t frame it as if the very concept of that person getting into the paint is “poor” defense. Especially so when the Mavs half court defense has actually been effective by the numbers against the Celtics (believe it’s like 98 per 100 possessions). Half the dump offs after getting into the paint are incorrect rotations which he unfortunately gives zero analysis into as Lively and DJJ in particular have been poor these last two games on that aspect (Luka and Kyrie could do better as well). Very misleading how presented.</p></li>

<li><p>He then will make great points about how the Mavs being so middling from above the break 3’s is allowing KP to play a free safety type role and reducing the ability of our lob game (he didn’t really touch on that iirc but I will cuz the enclosed spacing is part of it). However he then follows great analysis like this with horrible analysis:</p></li>

<li><p>He says the Mavs attacking Tatum is proving unsuccessful because of his elite play on that end when in actuality the Mavs are shooting highly efficiently (60%) against him and is why they tried attacking him more. For reference, Kyrie and Luka which have emphasis placed on them in this video, are allowing 55% and 42% when the primary defender.</p></li>

<li><p>Another intentionally misleading point being Luka hanging back on the late Jrue/White steal. Yes, you can critique the intensity of which he got back in position but he was right in the fastbreak to take the paint than to contest the 3 with mismatched numbers. It was either an open three or a layup which was played correctly to allow the three.</p></li>
