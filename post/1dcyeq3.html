<p>You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to rotate after getting blown by. You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to box out. You don&rsquo;t need an explosive first step to simply attempt a basic close out. He does literally none of these things on nearly every possession</p>

<p>Idk about Kobe and MJ, but LeBron has had a lot of playoff runs in which he had to take rests on defense.</p>

<p>The Celtics have been able to take advantage of the Mavs in ways other teams can’t. Great combo of basketball IQ, dog, and skill with our top 8.</p>

      <label for="l81ueb4" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re nitpicking his examples and not his argument. Acting like Luka is the only offense is also disingenuous considering he&rsquo;s got Kyrie, who also copiloted a chip with Lebron and is considered better offensively than Pippen or Pau. Giannis did it on both ends with Kris Middleton as his sidekick. Hakeen did it on both ends with a washed Drexler and motley crue of role players.  Duncan always played both ends of the court.</p>

<p>His main point is &ldquo;People want to compare Luka to the greats I don&rsquo;t see why he should get a pass for making his team play 4 on 5 on that end&rdquo; and that point is valid.</p>

But watching him it seems to me at least that he has a hand in a majority of Celtics buckets when he&rsquo;s on the floor, even when he isn&rsquo;t the primary defender on the shot. Like enough that I think the amount he contributes for the celtics is, at the very least, real close in value to that 30/10/10</p>

      <label for="l81jwjp" class="commentText"><p>This. The dude might be hurt but being out of shape probably contributed to his injury, and then needing to carry the entire offensive load if Kyrie/the bench can’t produce makes it so this dude can’t play defence. Now not many(if any) players could do what Luka is doing but his weight and conditioning have to be criticized when he is clearly gassed in his first finals run. He gets paid 50m a year, has been a professional athlete since sixteen, practices multiple hours a day, but he can’t get his diet under control to lose 30-40 pounds which would absolutely help his game?</p>

<p>Inb4 “but he needs the weight because then he can back his opponents down” well yes but would you rather have him able to back opponents down or have more longevity, be less injury prone, be faster, and have better conditioning for deep playoff runs? You win some you lose some, and in this case losing some fucking weight will definitely help more than it hurts.</p>

LeBron did play defense at a high level, at least in the playoffs, so clearly one does not preclude the other. Even Harden put in more effort on defense than this during the playoffs. If Luka can&rsquo;t its either because of desire (unlikely) or a lack of conditioning (very likely)</p>

<p>Luka’s shotmaking has been brilliant but he’s been dreadful in most other facets of the game</p>

<p>Tatum’s shotmaking has been dreadful but he’s been brilliant in most other facets of the game</p>

<p>overall I’d say neither one is playing great but neither one is playing awful, either. the difference has been the Celtics team defense and the way their spacing completely neutralizes the defensive scheme that got Dallas here</p>

      <label for="l81c2l8" class="commentText"><p>well you gotta account for the assists too, but I am planning to do a rewatch bc I’m curious exactly how much Luka gave up in this game</p>

<p>EDIT: counted 31 points Luka gave back (11 off turnovers, 20 off getting beaten defensively) compared with 55 points scored and assisted (+24 net). didn’t count any buckets that Boston got by taking advantage of Luka being the low man though and honestly, 4 of Luka’s assists were very generously credited to him</p>

<p>I will say that Luka was bad, but Derrick Jones Jr and the bigs were the worst culprits as far as getting beaten on the perimeter</p>

      <label for="l81l1fp" class="commentText"><p>In game one he literally had one assist. Blame injuries, blame conditioning(which poor conditioning does contribute to injuries), either way, he clearly can’t keep up with the celtics in this series and is playing far from his best, both defensively and offensively.</p>

<p>Defensively he has looked atrocious most plays, he just doesn’t have the energy to give because he needs to give his all offensively, but he has looked far from typical on offence too. Sure he still got 30 on good efficiency, but especially in game one I have never seen Luka so hesitant with his shot. He’ll make a move, and where he would normally make a tough bucket he will hesitate and pass it. Multiple plays I’ve seen him make a move, beat the defender, and then when he’s relatively wide open he will hesitate and pass it instead. He is clearly not playing to his regular standard.</p>

<p>I also think Jaylen Browns defence needs more praise, he has just been so fucking good. He must have watched hours and hours of tape in his week off because he has so much discipline guarding Luka and there were a number of plays where his patience totally outplayed Luka and Luka failed to draw a rip through foul that he usually gets like 100% of the time. I saw Luka like visibly frustrated/shook that his swing the ball low, rip through move didn’t work on Brown and it was just amazing to watch a player actually beat Luka on that move.</p>

      <label for="l819e4l" class="commentText"><p>I said the same thing in another thread. Tatum&rsquo;s playmaking has objectively been better, his defense obviously clears, more hustle plays, and significantly more impact on the boards as most of Luka&rsquo;s rebounds are just the team freebies or he gives up on a defensive rotation to try and secure it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think all of that makes up for the gap in ppg. Luka has 12 turnovers and 12 assists on the series.</p>

<p>After that, yes the 5 all-stars helps. But he got by Luka every time and Mavs had to bring help or give up the free dunk/layup.</p>

<p>Like both 1st quarters there have been times I’ve been really impressed by his defense (at least relative to expectations). But then as the game goes on it all goes to shit.</p>

<p>Makes sense, the dude is the entire offense. Any possession he’s not directly involved in seems to go badly and the Celtics are making him work for everything. It’s just not sustainable to be doing that, let alone play good defense on top.</p>

Tatum has been the 3rd or 4th best player on his team and is being outplayed by Luka pretty significantly this series, but still winning because the Celtics are an amazing roster top to bottom. No other star player could be playing like Tatum and expect to be up 2-0. Luka is embarrassing on defense at times, no excuse for that really, but he&rsquo;s still putting up impressive performances as pretty much the only reliable offensive player.</p>

It&rsquo;s just more obvious when it&rsquo;s a lead ball handler and Ant still needs time to figure out working through the extra attention. Tatum was the exact same and he&rsquo;s pretty comfortable now. Ant is super young and was shooting above his head a little earlier in the playoffs so it all kinda fell apart at once for him with Kat shooting poorly at the same time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This feels like a Boston specific thing though because of how they&rsquo;re playing offense. They&rsquo;ll screen to get the Mavs crossmatched, and if one of the Jays has the ball up top with a mismatch, Celtics are specifically putting Kyrie or Luka&rsquo;s man in the dunker spot so that they&rsquo;re forced to contest at the rim. Really interesting stuff by Joe imo, idk if other teams do this but I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone do it more than Boston this postseason</p>

      <label for="l818rhk" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s bordering on delusion lol.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve uploaded about once every 4 days in the playoffs so naturally in the second round they made videos on the Nuggets-Wolves rollercoaster because that&rsquo;s what most people cared about.</p>

<p>They then made a video about the Mavs destroying the Wolves where Mavs fans are psychoanalyizing his vocal inflection to say that he hates them, when he always talks pretty monotone in the unscripted watchalong videos &amp; his podcast.</p>

<p>Before their finals preview, 2 of their previous 4 podcasts featured the Mavs pretty heavily. Over the last several years he&rsquo;s been nothing but positive on Luka Doncic on his podcast. Giving him his own tier in an under 25 ranking, constantly calling him an offensive great etc.</p>

<p>The delusion mostly comes from a video where he analyzed why Luka&rsquo;s on/off is the weakest of any player with multiple top 5 MVP finishes. It&rsquo;s delusional because he ends the video saying he&rsquo;s already one of the greatest offensive players of all time. The entire tone of the video was positive, people clearly just looked at the title and ran with it.</p>

<p>You can use the same argument to say that he hates the Celtics because we won 64 games and had the 4th highest net rating ever and before the finals we got <em>zero</em> traditional scripted videos this season and <em>zero</em> playoff videos. All we got were 2 watchalongs and 2 podcast clips lol.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and he typically releases an episode of his podcast after every finals game. He&rsquo;s done zero on the finals so far, and the Celtics are up 2-0. Clearly he hates the Celtics, right? He&rsquo;s obviously trying to avoid having to talk down on his favorite player Luka for a whole hour.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot of X’s and O’s being thrown around so I’m not surprised they hate Ben lol</p>

<p>There’s a highly upvoted post talking about how DJJ/PJ bringing up the ball and initiating plays is a problem—it’s literally an adjustment from game one to give Luka a second to breathe and try to get favorable cross matchups on the offensive end through PNR. Seeing him get pick-sixed in the backcourt by JB in game one, it was kind of evident Luka was being forced to do too much.</p>

      <label for="l81b2wb" class="commentText"><p>Luka&rsquo;s defense was terrible the past two games.  It&rsquo;s not only his inability to stay in front of his man, but his lack of effort that is the worst.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve seen Luka play this type of defense in the regular season, but he&rsquo;s shown he&rsquo;s capable of much better in previous playoff games.  This leads me to believe, that a large part of it is due to injuries along with not having the stamina to carry the Mavs on offense as well as expend energy on defense.</p>

<p>Injuries aside, Luka is a very large guy and unlike Lebron, MJ, Kawhi, Kobe and others in the past who carried big offensive loads yet played hard on defense, Luka doesn&rsquo;t look to be in top physical conditioning.</p>

      <label for="l81fd3c" class="commentText"><p>Which honestly surprises me since in my opinion the Mavericks&rsquo; best chance of winning this series is to turn it from the Celtics vs Luka and Kyrie into Tatum vs Luka.</p>

<p>As much as I love Tatum, he can 100% be baited into terrible shots. Think of him over relying on his spinning fade in the midrange which he maybe shoots 35% on instead of just rising up and shooting over the top of his man despite being 6&rsquo;9 with a near 7 foot wingspan, or how he often opts for his sidestep 3 when he&rsquo;s matched up with a big on the perimeter.</p>

<p>Right now the Mavs are daring Tatum to pick them apart with his passing and have the rest of the C&rsquo;s beat them, and he and the Celtics have very much done just that. Down 2-0 I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s time to change up your defensive strategy.</p>

      <label for="l81k91h" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s too late to bait him into bad shots. We already saw him turn down a lot in Game 1 and then in Game 2 he may have overcompensated with the rim attempts. But it resulted in a ton of assists either way so he might just lean into that at this point</p>

      <label for="l81vadr" class="commentText"><p>Tatum is averaging 29 drives a game which is 10 more than he averaged in the ECF, in the regular season he only averaged 9 drives a game. The gameplan is clearly drive and kick as much as you can, I don’t hate the shots he took even tho he missed a bunch. Law of averages has to come into effect at some point</p>

      <label for="l81ml8m" class="commentText"><p>Mavs are definitely in a spot and I’m not sure how they get out of it. If they stay tight on the shooters and let Tatum and brown go one on one, that’ll also be a disaster because Celtics have been hunting Luka and kyrie tenaciously and neither of them are particularly good at navigating screens and getting over quickly. Unless they go under on Tatum and invite him to shoot? I know he’s a streaky shooter but I don’t know if guarding him like he’s Gianni’s is the answer lol</p>

<p>Boston has a multitude of defenders to throw at them and the issue is that Mavs don’t have the personnel to throw at brown and tatum. Porzingis being back and stretching the floor doesn’t even account for his ability to attack mismatches also. Tough situation overall and the more I think about it I don’t know how Mavs take more than 1 game without Luka and Kyrie going for 80 combined</p>
