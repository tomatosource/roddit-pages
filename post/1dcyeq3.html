      <label for="l818s07" class="commentText"><p>it seems like the consensus is that Luka has been the best player in this series, but quite frankly the gap between Luka and Tatum hasn’t been as vast as the stats would make you believe</p>

<p>Luka’s shotmaking has been brilliant but he’s been dreadful in most other facets of the game</p>

<p>Tatum’s shotmaking has been dreadful but he’s been brilliant in most other facets of the game</p>

<p>overall I’d say neither one is playing great but neither one is playing awful, either. the difference has been the Celtics team defense and the way their spacing completely neutralizes the defensive scheme that got Dallas here</p>

      <label for="l819e4l" class="commentText"><p>I said the same thing in another thread. Tatum&rsquo;s playmaking has objectively been better, his defense obviously clears, more hustle plays, and significantly more impact on the boards as most of Luka&rsquo;s rebounds are just the team freebies or he gives up on a defensive rotation to try and secure it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think all of that makes up for the gap in ppg. Luka has 12 turnovers and 12 assists on the series.</p>

<p>Go look how many videos this dude has made about Boston before the NBA finals btw; 4 months ago was the last one lol, and it was about the Nuggets/Celtics close finish. And you don&rsquo;t hear our fanbase whining about some podcaster who refuses to make videos about us. So damn silly.</p>

      <label for="l818rhk" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s bordering on delusion lol.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve uploaded about once every 4 days in the playoffs so naturally in the second round they made videos on the Nuggets-Wolves rollercoaster because that&rsquo;s what most people cared about.</p>

<p>They then made a video about the Mavs destroying the Wolves where Mavs fans are psychoanalyizing his vocal inflection to say that he hates them, when he always talks pretty monotone in the unscripted watchalong videos &amp; his podcast.</p>

<p>Before their finals preview, 2 of their previous 4 podcasts featured the Mavs pretty heavily. Over the last several years he&rsquo;s been nothing but positive on Luka Doncic on his podcast. Giving him his own tier in an under 25 ranking, constantly calling him an offensive great etc.</p>

<p>The delusion mostly comes from a video where he analyzed why Luka&rsquo;s on/off is the weakest of any player with multiple top 5 MVP finishes. It&rsquo;s delusional because he ends the video saying he&rsquo;s already one of the greatest offensive players of all time. The entire tone of the video was positive, people clearly just looked at the title and ran with it.</p>

<p>You can use the same argument to say that he hates the Celtics because we won 64 games and had the 4th highest net rating ever and before the finals we got <em>zero</em> traditional scripted videos this season and <em>zero</em> playoff videos. All we got were 2 watchalongs and 2 podcast clips lol.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and he typically releases an episode of his podcast after every finals game. He&rsquo;s done zero on the finals so far, and the Celtics are up 2-0. Clearly he hates the Celtics, right? He&rsquo;s obviously trying to avoid having to talk down on his favorite player Luka for a whole hour.</p>

      <label for="l81bk5t" class="commentText"><p>Not even trying to be a hater here but some of the ‘analysis’ I’ve read on the Mavericks sub is…something.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot of X’s and O’s being thrown around so I’m not surprised they hate Ben lol</p>

<p>There’s a highly upvoted post talking about how DJJ/PJ bringing up the ball and initiating plays is a problem—it’s literally an adjustment from game one to give Luka a second to breathe and try to get favorable cross matchups on the offensive end through PNR. Seeing him get pick-sixed in the backcourt by JB in game one, it was kind of evident Luka was being forced to do too much.</p>

      <label for="l81b8hu" class="commentText"><p>In raw PPG. But when you adjust for pace the Celtics beat them pretty easily. 123.2 vs 121.0 ORTG. Which is the amount of points you score per 100 possessions and is much better than PPG as a metric.</p>

<p>The Pacers were just 2nd in pace and the Celtics 19th so they had more chances to put up points.</p>

<p>The bigger issue, as has always been the biggest issue with Luka’s defense, is his awareness when he’s off ball. I don’t understand how be makes crazy behing the back passes on offense, but has no idea what going on around him on defense sometimes</p>

<p>I said this in the next day thread, but it sometimes feels like &ldquo;protect the rim&rdquo; feels less like a defensive philsophy and more a mental block where it&rsquo;s the only thing they know how to do</p>

      <label for="l81b2wb" class="commentText"><p>Luka&rsquo;s defense was terrible the past two games.  It&rsquo;s not only his inability to stay in front of his man, but his lack of effort that is worst.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve seen Luka play this type of defense in the regular season, but he&rsquo;s usually been much better in the playoffs.  This leads me to believe, that a large part of it is due to his injuries as well as him not having the stamina to carry the Mavs on offense as well as expend energy on defense.</p>

<p>Injuries aside, Luka is a very large guy and unlike Lebron, MJ, Kawhi, Kobe and others in the past who carried huge offensive loads yet played good to great defense, Luka doesn&rsquo;t look to be in top physical conditioning.</p>
