</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Disclaimer: This is not a post about which is the strongest or most talented team. But teams with the best teamwork shown. The core that plays the best with each other.</p>

<p><strong>Here is mine</strong></p>

<p>1.<strong>Mid 2000s - Early 2010s Spurs</strong> - obviously, they are not the best/most talented team in history. Though, they have the GOAT PF in Timmy, and solid all star players in Manu and Tony. But aside from talent, they really invented the ball movement beautiful basketball. Even Role Players like Diaw and Bowen plays perfectly in their continuous ball movement style of basketball. Hats off to Coach Pop.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>2015-2016 Warriors</strong> - Yes, Pre KD Warriors. They are literally the ones who adapted Spurs ball movement system style. And added some flashy dunks, and freestyle spam of outside shooting. Steph and Klay shooting the lights out, with Draymond, Iggy, Zaza, etc facilitating or screening for them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>2008-2010 Celtics</strong> - Arguably the first Big 3 team in 21st century. Maybe Big 4 if you count Rondo. But the sudden formation of  big 3 of Pierce, Ray Allen, and KG suddenly worked wonders. Their skillsets complement each other to the fullest that it allows for the &ldquo;Big 3&rdquo; formula to work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>90s Bulls</strong> - I feel like 90s bulls is a little bit underrated when it comes to teamwork. Modern younger People thought it is just give the ball to MJ, and let him cook. Though, it might be a little true in some parts, especially in the clutch. For the whole game, MJ plays under a Triangle System. Scottie is a Point Forward/Defensive Specialist who facilitates well. Ron Harper is another lengthy defensive guard. Rodman is also an elite Big Man Defender/Inside Defender. And yes, MJ is also an elite defender. AND YES, I consider elite team defense as teamwork too. In,  offense, MJ might take the most shots, but those are actually on the flow of the offense. And Ofc, Scottie, Harper, Rodman, Kukoc, etc have scoring opportunities too.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>80s Showtime Lakers</strong> - With Magic leading the showtime exciting fast paced fast break style of basketball the lakers did in 80s, it actually required a lot of teamwork. Kareem was still a monster inside but he was older. Still he made sure he can keep up with the uptempo style of Magic and his teammates. Worthy, Scott, Cooper, Etc knew where they should be in an attack. Sometimes, Magic doesn&rsquo;t even pass to the man, he pass it to the area where the player is suppoosed to be!!!. That&rsquo;s why he is considered by many as the best passer/playmaker of all time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>HONORABLE MENTIONS</strong></p>

<p>These are teams who I highly considered:</p>

<p>80s Celtics of Bird, Mchale, and Parish</p>

<p>Early 2010s Heat of Lebron, Wade, Bosh</p>

<p>2004 Pistons (The Defensive Juggernaut)</p>

<p>1987-1990 Bad Boy Pistons of Zeke</p>

<p>Which teams do you think deserve honorable mentions?</p>

      <label for="lma5mye" class="commentText"><p>Early 2000s Sacramento kings. Chris Webber was probably their best player and he made one all nba first team. Next best player was probably peja stojakovic</p>

<p>The team would win 55-60 games each year and went toe to toe with the Kobe/shaq lakers. Of course everyone knows they were cheated out of a chance to win a championship but that team was known for its ball movement and unselfish ways</p>
