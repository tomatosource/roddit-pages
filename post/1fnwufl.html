</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I started watching basketball in the early 2000’s and I’m a lifelong Laker fan. It was clear Shaq was starting to decline as he left LA and he clearly took a step back to Wade.</p>

<p>Wade led Miami in PPG, APG, FGA &amp; usage rate. So why was Shaq MVP runner up when he wasn’t really the best player? Was it just media bias?</p>

Missed the playoffs and then 2 1st round exits as bad seeds (2005-2007) until Pau Gasol showed up in 2008.  Shaq was just really demanding to play against for a lot of teams even as he started to fall off.</p>

      <label for="lom2y7n" class="commentText"><p>ADs lead in ppg, rpg, and spg was narrow at best and insignificant at worst, and fails to mention that Lebron also had considerably more assists. If we are looking purely at stats, I’d prefer a player averaging 1 ppg and 1 rpg less but 7 apg more. He was playing out of position and yet he was still, almost inarguably, the best offensive player in the league by far that season. There’s an argument to be made Lebron deserved MVP that year.</p>

<p>Lebron splits: 25 / 8 / 10 with 2 stocks on 58 TS%</p>

<p>AD splits: 26 / 9 / 3 with 3.8 stocks on 61 TS%</p>

<p>This also doesn’t speak to the problem with just stat-watching, because there’s a lot that doesn’t show up. AD was awesome that year, but, in my opinion, LBJ was better on offense than AD was on defense, with  a larger discrepancy between them on offense than defense. Even if you disagree, I don’t see how this is in any way comparable to an obviously past his prime Shaq taking credit away from a young, elite Dwyane Wade. The gap is, at bar minimum, much closer, if not outright favorable to LBJ.</p>

<p>They famously lost to the Pistons there.</p>

<p>After that Shaq did start to break down some, but was still a potent interior force whose reputation was often enough, and let his latest godly guard in Wade absolutely wreck shop.</p>

<p>It was pretty close to a 1A/1B with Wade and Shaq that year, but the arrival of Shaq led to them winning 17 more games even though he missed a few himself. He had the best on/off splits on the team, and even though it felt like Wade’s team I don’t think that was fully accepted until the following season.</p>

<p>There was also a lot of people just not buying in to Nash.</p>

<li>Miami went from <code>(42-40)</code> to <code>(59-23)</code> after Shaq joined the heat in 2005</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Lakers went from <code>(56-26)</code> to <code>(34-48)</code> after he left</li>
<li>His regular season numbers were decent <code>(23ppg / 10.4 rbd)</code></li>
<li>There was an <em>incredible</em> amount of attention on the Kobe-Shaq split. &ldquo;Kobe ran Shaq out of town&rdquo; was an easy narrative and the idea that Shaq was an MVP-level player was convenient</li>
</ol>

<p>The reality is Shaq was showing signs of being washed in 2005, then barely holding on the next year (13.7ppg in the NBA finals?). The fact he hobbled through roster spots on three more teams until 2011 is, in retrospect, kind of astonishing.</p>

Not to mention, the MASSIVE decrease in success the Lakers saw (especially in the center position) immediately after Shaq left. It wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence.

<p>And to answer your question, no. Because for you to be the most valuable, chances are you are also the best. Whether it be through basic stats, advanced stats, performance, etc. and while Wade had more points than Shaq, I don&rsquo;t think he was more VALUABLE than Shaq in 05, the same way the winner of the 05 mvp, Nash, didn&rsquo;t score more points than Amare.</p>
