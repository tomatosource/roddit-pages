</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I started watching basketball in the early 2000’s and I’m a lifelong Laker fan. It was clear Shaq was starting to decline as he left LA and he clearly took a step back to Wade.</p>

<p>Wade led Miami in PPG, APG, FGA &amp; usage rate. So why was Shaq MVP runner up when he wasn’t really the best player? Was it just media bias?</p>

<p>Not sure anyone really overrated Wade. I think he&rsquo;s pretty properly rated. He was a really great 2guard who may have ended up higher on all time lists if he was healthier.</p>

<p>He had a very flawed game, never learned how to shoot. His defense was also very underrated, he was one of the leaders in blocks for a guard for his entire career.</p>

      <label for="lomqmfp" class="commentText"><p>Your attempt at making a point suggested I was inadvertently agreeing with OP because LeBron, not Wade, would have won FMVP if LeBron played to his normal standard.</p>

<p>I never said anything about LeBron playing to his normal standard, so I simply corrected your reading comprehension error. Now you are talking about 2012, which is completely irrelevant to your original attempt at pointing out a flaw in my logic. I don&rsquo;t get what you are trying to achieve now beyond being an insecure Bronsexual.</p>

Defender primarily guarding the offense, altering shots, forcing bad shot attempts, and AD on the weakside for the clean up.</p>

<p>Basketball is a team sport buddy. The only individual thing is free throws.</p>

      <label for="lom2y7n" class="commentText"><p>ADs lead in ppg, rpg, and spg was narrow at best and insignificant at worst, and fails to mention that Lebron also had considerably more assists. If we are looking purely at stats, I’d prefer a player averaging 1 ppg and 1 rpg less but 7 apg more. He was playing out of position and yet he was still, almost inarguably, the best offensive player in the league by far that season. There’s an argument to be made Lebron deserved MVP that year.</p>

<p>Lebron splits: 25 / 8 / 10 with 2 stocks on 58 TS%</p>

<p>AD splits: 26 / 9 / 3 with 3.8 stocks on 61 TS%</p>

<p>This also doesn’t speak to the problem with just stat-watching, because there’s a lot that doesn’t show up. AD was awesome that year, but, in my opinion, LBJ was better on offense than AD was on defense, with  a larger discrepancy between them on offense than defense. Even if you disagree, I don’t see how this is in any way comparable to an obviously past his prime Shaq taking credit away from a young, elite Dwyane Wade. The gap is, at bar minimum, much closer, if not outright favorable to LBJ.</p>

<p>There is literally no evidence that Wade was &ldquo;clearly their best player&rdquo; except thinking higher points and assists = better player, which is just plain dumb.</p>

They never quite figured it out yet still made the Finals again.</p>

<p>They famously lost to the Pistons there.</p>

<p>After that Shaq did start to break down some, but was still a potent interior force whose reputation was often enough, and let his latest godly guard in Wade absolutely wreck shop.</p>

<p>It was pretty close to a 1A/1B with Wade and Shaq that year, but the arrival of Shaq led to them winning 17 more games even though he missed a few himself. He had the best on/off splits on the team, and even though it felt like Wade’s team I don’t think that was fully accepted until the following season.</p>

<p>There was also a lot of people just not buying in to Nash.</p>

It’s also why someone won’t claim booker is better than kd or ad is better than lebron for their teams right now. Until the legend is noticeably worse, if it’s close who’s the alpha, people will stick with the legend</p>

<li>Miami went from <code>(42-40)</code> to <code>(59-23)</code> after Shaq joined the heat in 2005</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Lakers went from <code>(56-26)</code> to <code>(34-48)</code> after he left</li>
<li>His regular season numbers were decent <code>(23ppg / 10.4 rbd)</code></li>
<li>There was an <em>incredible</em> amount of attention on the Kobe-Shaq split. &ldquo;Kobe ran Shaq out of town&rdquo; was an easy narrative and the idea that Shaq was an MVP-level player was convenient</li>
</ol>

<p>The reality is Shaq was showing signs of being washed in 2005, then barely holding on the next year (13.7ppg in the NBA finals?). The fact he hobbled through roster spots on three more teams until 2011 is, in retrospect, kind of astonishing.</p>

<p>Wade was going to be the best, no question. But without Shaq, there was no way they were sniffing even 50 wins let alone damn near 60. He flipped the whole franchise overnight while dwade was ascending.</p>

      <label for="lomaedo" class="commentText"><p>That season Wade was the focus of the opposing teams defenses, and his drives to the basket attracted so much attention that often shaq benefited from easy handoffs. This is why it’s important to first watch the games, see what actually happened, then post an opinion here.</p>

Dwades real ascension came the following year but in 05, ppl were literally begging for dwade to win games if it meant getting the ball out of Shaqs hand. They just didn&rsquo;t realise dwade was fuckin nice.</p>

      <label for="lomb57u" class="commentText"><p>Shaq was still a great player in 04/05 but he was clearly on the decline. As a laker fan during that time, I so wanted shaq to be the same dominant presence when he got to Miami, but as I watched those games I came to the realization that Wade was the better player at that point. Wade had also deferred to shaq more than he should have then, I believe it was out of respect to the big diesel</p>

      <label for="lomdcu8" class="commentText"><p>He really wasn&rsquo;t on the decline till the next year actually and even in 06, he was far from what he was in Cleveland or phx. Once again, most ppl agreed at the time that he was the most VALUABLE. You could argue Wade was better, but with no Shaq, they weren&rsquo;t making it past the first round, let alone the ECF. Not to mention, the MASSIVE decrease in success the Lakers saw (especially in the center position) immediately after Shaq left. It wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence. Shaq earned that #2 voter spot more than Wade did that year.</p>

      <label for="lomhpsr" class="commentText"><p>I said you could argue Wade was better. I don&rsquo;t think he was in 05, even if he didn&rsquo;t score as many points.</p>

<p>And to answer your question, no. Because for you to be the most valuable, chances are you are also the best. Whether it be through basic stats, advanced stats, performance, etc. and while Wade had more points than Shaq, I don&rsquo;t think he was more VALUABLE than Shaq in 05, the same way the winner of the 05 mvp, Nash, didn&rsquo;t score more points than Amare.</p>

      <label for="lomks6j" class="commentText"><p>Nash and stoudemire is an interesting one, but look at the 03/04 suns record and the 04/05 record when nash joined. Phoenix carried over three of their top players (Johnson, amare, Marion), with nash replacing Marbury. And the suns ended up more than doubling their win total. Nash was the 4th leading scorer but if he really wanted to, he could have been the top scorer on the suns squad. He was the distribution engine of the team. If he plays, they win. If he sits, they lose. Shaq did not have that level of an impact by the time he got to Miami. I don’t think anyone could argue that Marion or amare were better than nash was that season because they clearly weren’t</p>

      <label for="lommfy7" class="commentText"><p>Your description of what happened with pre-nash vs first year Nash suns is exactly what happened with the heat.</p>

<p>There was no way Steve Nash could have scored than Amare who was a scoring machine (zero defense) big man. Their problem was they just couldn&rsquo;t gel with everyone wanting to score and their defense was abysmal at best. In walks Nash who takes the ball out of everyone&rsquo;s hands, redistributes it with a.rvolutionary offense by D&rsquo;Antoni and you have a 60 win suns team. Nash is the clear mvp and isn&rsquo;t even the third highest scorer on the team.</p>

<p>Without Shaq, the 04 heat were a middling team, lucking to do well enough during a time where the east was at its worst in a long time. They couldn&rsquo;t score, they couldn&rsquo;t stop teams from scoring, they couldnt rebound for shit, and they had no interior threat.</p>

<p>In walks Shaq (and basically only Shaq, losing key up and coming players like Lamar Odom), and they instantly become a top 5 offense and a top 6 defense. They become the 6th best rebounding team when prior they were at the bottom 10 the last year. All the while, Shaq revitalizes their interior defense and scoring threat down low. He lost a step, naturally, but the moment he came in, the identity of the heat changed overnight when he averaged <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> and 2 blocks.</p>

<p>Dwade might have averaged more points (only 2 more if I rmeember correctly) but it was everywhere else that Shaq was anchoring the team. It&rsquo;s very clear why he was not just the number 1 mvp votes on his team, but number 2 in the entire league.</p>
