      <label for="lbsyexa" class="commentText"><p>The 2024 Celtics are an odd team in how the public responds to them.  In 5 years, people are gonna talk about the 2024 season like everyone knew the Celtics were the most dominant team and it was no surprise they won.  Overtime people are gonna forget people were doubting them the entire season and had written them off as champions when they lost game 2 to Miami.  Has there ever been a team like this?  I feel like there are other examples I just can’t think of right now</p>

      <label for="lbt29jq" class="commentText"><p>Actually, yeah, I remember that now.  A lot of people doubted their play style.  I guess looking back, I was a junior in high school in 2015 and every person I knew, students, teachers, all of us were convinced we were the next dynasty half way through the 2015 season.  And we ended up being correct, though not in the way we expected, that’s for sure.  2015 will always be my favorite Dubs title, even over 2022.  It was such a magical year where everyone was jazzed up talking about the Dubs.</p>

You can disagree of course, but no one here believed the Cavs could beat us until 2016 when they did.  I still believe we could have beaten a healthy Cavs team in 2015.  Nobody has anything other than speculation here, so you can speculate something different from me but it doesn’t make it any more true</p>

If the Thunder made the Western Conference Finals and NBA Finals the next 4 or 5 years as their young players were coming into their primes, I have to imagine they&rsquo;d be given the same treatment despite everything.</p>

<p>The Jays are 26 and 27 and are in their primes. This was the most obvious conclusion once we got halfway through the season and we didn&rsquo;t have a slump, and just kept dominating.</p>

<p>Sure, there were many disappointments but they were clearly stacked and the only thing stopping them from getting to the finals with the then still weak east was injuries and the loss of chemistry.</p>

<p>The past season, I already expected them to be in the Finals as I thought the two Heat Finals&rsquo; appearances were extremely fortunate and in a vacuum the Celts would have reached the Finals on those years.</p>

The two regular season games were so close and the deciding factor was closing out which the Celtics figured out by the end of the season and proved it in the playoffs. Would have been a great series.</p>

<p>When Jokic was off the court the Nuggets had a -8.62 net rating, when he was on they were +11.67. For reference that means that when Jokic was on the court the Nuggets played like the Celtics (+11.6) and when he was off the court they played like the Pistons or Wizards (-9.1).</p>

They’re a lot like Denver, but just lack a true offensive threat.</p>

<p>Dallas was probably the most favorable matchup the Celtics could have gotten. They stomped them in the regular season before &amp; after the trade deadline. Plus Kyrie always plays like trash against the Celtics.</p>

<p>I still think Boston would beat the Timberwolves. But it would have been more competitive than Dallas.
Denver - Boston finals certainly would have went 7.</p>

      <label for="lbtk2qm" class="commentText"><p>Did you mean Reid or gobert instead of ant? Because ant is pretty normal sized (by basketball standards)</p>

<p>Our issue is that jokic is too strong for our bigs and can&rsquo;t be doubled because he can create equally as well as a passer. None of the twolves bigs do that close to as well as he does</p>

<p>But I do agree that Minny would&rsquo;ve been tougher than Dallas, and that Denver would&rsquo;ve been tougher than Minny. I was actually more scared of OKC than Dallas or Minny funnily enough</p>

A Wolves matchup with the Rudy/KAT and Naz I think would provide more interesting coaching especially with KP getting hurt again.</p>

<p>We saw Rudy defending in the perimeter and it didn’t work, we also saw Ant needing oxygen to get through a 1-4 WCFs loss, how would his conditioning have been extending even further? I watched Ant go young Brown just driving wildly into traffic in the WCFs and the Celtics have improved on that. Tatum and JB improved in playmaking, <a href="https://youtu.be/pY1Vq2E9w2g?si=jA3kDuWJjvJVoy4r" target="_blank">especially Tatum</a>this post <a href="https://youtu.be/SCW5cZ7Ot54?si=07wq5i0nblgvViTe" target="_blank">season</a>. There’s no way Rudy or KAT are defending shit like this. It was easier to defend Ant driving wildly to the rim like he was hoping for a few sports center highlight dunks</p>

<p>Then they played the Pels and trailed by as many as 17 points. They were down at least double digits for most of the first three quarters. People were wondering what was wrong with the Celtics. Then they turned it on won a great game.</p>

<p>In March, they had a disastrous B2B in Atlanta, choking away both games, and were finishing the road trip in New Orleans. When they got down big in the first quarter, fans were expressing concern that they were playing their worst basketball of the season heading into the playoffs. Then they dominated the rest of the game.</p>

      <label for="lbtxxg9" class="commentText"><p>What is this supposed to mean? The way you’re supposed to win games is by having a loaded roster. The Celtics are unimpressive team because they’re an impressively talented team? If you think the only way a team doing well is impressive is if it’s a surprise, then maybe you should evaluate why these other impressive teams are surprising you.</p>
