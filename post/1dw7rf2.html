      <label for="lbsyexa" class="commentText"><p>The 2024 Celtics are an odd team in how the public responds to them.  In 5 years, people are gonna talk about the 2024 season like everyone knew the Celtics were the most dominant team and it was no surprise they won.  Overtime people are gonna forget people were doubting them the entire season and had written them off as champions when they lost game 2 to Miami.  Has there ever been a team like this?  I feel like there are other examples I just can’t think of right now</p>

      <label for="lbt29jq" class="commentText"><p>Actually, yeah, I remember that now.  A lot of people doubted their play style.  I guess looking back, I was a junior in high school in 2015 and every person I knew, students, teachers, all of us were convinced we were the next dynasty half way through the 2015 season.  And we ended up being correct, though not in the way we expected, that’s for sure.  2015 will always be my favorite Dubs title, even over 2022.  It was such a magical year where everyone was jazzed up talking about the Dubs.</p>

You can disagree of course, but no one here believed the Cavs could beat us until 2016 when they did.  I still believe we could have beaten a healthy Cavs team in 2015.  Nobody has anything other than speculation here, so you can speculate something different from me but it doesn’t make it any more true</p>

The two regular season games were so close and the deciding factor was closing out which the Celtics figured out by the end of the season and proved it in the playoffs. Would have been a great series.</p>

<p>Then they played the Pels and trailed by as many as 17 points. They were down at least double digits for most of the first three quarters. People were wondering what was wrong with the Celtics. Then they turned it on won a great game.</p>

<p>In March, they had a disastrous B2B in Atlanta, choking away both games, and were finishing the road trip in New Orleans. When they got down big in the first quarter, fans were expressing concern that they were playing their worst basketball of the season heading into the playoffs.

      <label for="lbt40ag" class="commentText"><p>Thats a weak take, but to your point, I would argee that for the entirety of the JT and JB era, Brad Stevens has been the most valuable part of the Celtics organization, both as coach and GM.  He got young players to overachieve and then stepped a side and assembled a brute squad.</p>
