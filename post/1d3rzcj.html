      <label for="l6aghdj" class="commentText"><p>No amount of context can save that. Holy gates of hell, that‚Äôs bad.</p>

<p>I feel like there‚Äôs a pattern with dudes like this, when they write women being brutally assaulted and in grossest ways they consider it ‚Äúartistic‚Äù and ‚Äúrepresenting the real struggles of women.‚Äù</p>

<p>When someone else writes a decent woman who‚Äôs maybe a bit traditional and feminine they consider it misogyny and ‚Äúbenevolent patriarchy‚Äù or whatever that means.</p>

<p>For some reason they think that a comic that doesn‚Äôt address and viscerally depict the terrible things that happen to women is doing a disservice to women. But come on this is wack.</p>

<p>Most women aren‚Äôt assaulted every day, sometimes they just want fiction where that isn‚Äôt a plot point or consideration. Sometimes they want a cool supporting character, or a protagonist who doesn‚Äôt get raped.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs like those people who think that racism should be a part of every story with a black character to remind the audience that black people have it hard irl, which is ironically very racist.</p>

Meanwhile Miyazaki is regarded as one of the most miserable, pessimistic, condescending a-holse you could ever interact with, while creating breathtaking and incredibly heartwarming or sorrowfully moving stories in the industry&hellip; it is like the opposite of Allan Moore and Tolkein, where they both write exactly what you would expect to the letter XD</p>

      <label for="l6ao795" class="commentText"><p>You know what would be a better and more enlightening exercise? Actually engaging with the substance of his criticism which is <a href="https://seamas.medium.com/fantasy-must-be-sharper-an-interview-with-alan-moore-883d4b8196aa" target="_blank">genuinely pretty interesting</a>. He&rsquo;s a fascinating literary figure and there is some truth to much of what he says. So instead of reflexively trying to &ldquo;debunk&rdquo; him with counter-examples, maybe try understanding his point first. You&rsquo;ll also find you can probably appreciate LotR better since anyone who has actually read the books would know Eowyn is a much lesser character in them than she is in the films, and her book character arc is absolutely dripping with misogyny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harm? Oh no even when he goes out at night its just to look at the stars, but you were wondering where that boss hobbit of yours is well, Worm here is the one to ask. Stabbed him in his sleep and buried him somewhere I should think although <strong>he has been quite hungry recently.</strong> No Worm here is not very nice at all you had better leave him with me&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made me do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes yes Worm does what Sharky says and I say WE ARE GOING&rdquo;</p>

<p>Boots him in the face</p>

      <label for="l69ilgu" class="commentText"><p>Eh, Frodo&rsquo;s parents werent massive nobles or anything, kinda upper class mom I guess. Lobellia throws a bunch of classist rhetoric at him, says he&rsquo;s not even a real Baggins so even his fairly elite Brandybuck status was seen as a downside to some. Being adopted by Bilbo didnt hurt, but even Bilbo wasnt exactly a massive lord, he was just rich from his adventure</p>

<p>I think probably more poignant is that even the god-king super hobbit of the shire wouldnt really account for too much in Gondor, every hobbit is kind of a common-folk relative to elves or Dunedain. Gandalf saying that the mithril coat Thorin just gave away to Bilbo was worth <em>more than the shire</em> kind of sums it up</p>

<p>The Bagginses were probably landed gentry to use a Victorian term. Bilbos mom was a took, and daughter of the old Took so Bilbos maternal grandfather was the Thane of the shire. He himself may not have a high title, as hobbits in general didn&rsquo;t really carry, but he was definitely one of the upper crust of the hobbits.</p>

      <label for="l6a1r84" class="commentText"><p>In terms of actual nobility it&rsquo;s hard to determine because none of the hobbits seem to have acquired their titles by decree. The offices in the shire most equivalent to a feudal lord seem to be appointed by committee and not inheritance or royal design. So one could argue they are all common by blood. In stark contrast to Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli, and Legolas who are all essentially princes.</p>

<p>In terms of family status, only Frodo seems to hold a position of authority in his, being the sole inheritor of the Baggins name and fortune. The rest of the Baggins line marrying off or dying heirless. Merry and Pippin both come from large and prominent families of the shire, sure. But Peregrine Took is the fourth son of an offshoot of the Tooks and Bagginses. Mariadoc Brandybuck is really the only one who can claim an important lineage, being a direct patrilineal descendant of &ldquo;Gorhendad Oldbuck&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In terms of wealth, yes only Sam is &ldquo;common&rdquo;, at least in the beginning of the books. Pippin is probably upper middle class, but Frodo and Merry are certainly some of the richest hobbits in the Shire by the time of Bilbo&rsquo;s party.</p>

      <label for="l6aam4j" class="commentText"><p>Solid agree with you on this one. Tolkien does that classic thing where, for the <em>only two women</em> in his whole story, he constantly talks about how pretty they are. For Galadriel it makes sense because she has some otherworldly magical thing going on, but Eowyn? Every second sentence about her he mentions how &ldquo;fair&rdquo; she is. She&rsquo;s literally dying on the ground after stabbing the witch king and he can&rsquo;t help himself, &ldquo;oh woe it is that someone so hot can be so dying&rdquo;. Most of the stuff before that point is just &ldquo;also Eowyn was present, and she was very attractive. Then she cried, but in like a sexy way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Eowyn does essentially nothing in the story up until the point where she kills the witch king, and that pretty much comes out of nowhere. Galadriel is mostly a background character who only appears for a brief moment during the fellowship&rsquo;s stopover in the forest (though I do think she&rsquo;s a good character). So there are only two women in the story, they both have very little writing dedicated to them, and Tolkien rants on and on about how attractive they are. Lastly, for those who haven&rsquo;t read the books, Arwen is not in them. The movies aren&rsquo;t <em>great</em> with female characters either, but I personally think Peter Jackson elevated them well above the original writing.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The books are great, but they are not some bastion of feminism as this post would indicate. Tolkien is exactly as bad with female characters as every other male author of the time was (and many still are today).</p>

So I understand coming to the defense of something we love but this is a well thought out criticism. Plus your description of Eowyn&rsquo;s post Nazg√ªl stab scene was stinking funny.</p>

<p>I would add though that Arwen does show up in the books briefly and these appearances are heavily drenched in descriptions of just how god damn hot she is.</p>

There‚Äôs like 3 women in the whole thing, and two of them are basically just fawning over the same guy the whole time. It‚Äôs not a problem, not every book needs good (or any) female characters. The ladies in the book have small moments but mostly they‚Äôre pretty simple plot devices to help the main characters keep moving. There are other stories with great female characters, it‚Äôs fine that this isn‚Äôt one of them and doesn‚Äôt at all take away from it.</p>

      <label for="l6ajeq6" class="commentText"><p>Wholly agree. (talking about the movies here. Not sure how the books differ) Arwen was badass when transporting Frodo to the elven domain, but after that she basically became a damsel waiting for her &ldquo;knight in shining armor&rdquo; to come back to her. All while a powerful male figure (Elrond) was trying to emotionally control her and make her leave middle earth. Eowyn had that one badass moment/one liner against the witch king, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>I love LotR, and Eowyn was a strong female character in the movies I&rsquo;d say. But &ldquo;greatest female heroes ever written&rdquo;? Not even close&hellip; Mulan (the cartoon movie), Sarah Connor (Terminator), Furiosa (Mad Max), the MC in Kill Bill (did she have a name&hellip;?), Ripley (Alien), and Buffy (Buffy the vampire slayer) were all better &ldquo;female heroes&rdquo; than Eowyn, just to name a few&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l6ashue" class="commentText"><p>Thanks for the realistic take. Some people act like Tolkien was a progressive by modern standards, conveniently forgetting that he was very much a product of his time. Wonderful books but I think there is a tendency to want everything to be &lsquo;all good&rsquo; or &lsquo;all bad&rsquo; these days, and there is certainly room for criticism and for viewing the books through a historic lens.</p>

      <label for="l69r6ga" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Aragorns importance was actually more for the gambit Gandalf was playing, needing a figure that could unite the kingdoms behind him and scare Sauron enough to have him make mistakes.</p>

<p>Idk if Aragorn was destined to be a better ruler than the stewards, they did fairly well and Denethor was highly praised and a very powerful and fairly successful ruler up until the end despite Mordor. Aragorn was certainly awesome, but that felt more like his personal character than a &lsquo;destiny&rsquo; (being raised by elves and living such a hardcore life of responsibility made him a chad, not necessarily his blood and birthright).</p>

<p>His success was also very much because Sauron was gone as Sauron had been directly fking with the men of the west and east for thousands of years.</p>

<p>And yeah idk, Sam become the basically permanent mayor of the shire. The line of Durin fails in the hobbit but Dain is fk awesome. There were no high-kings of the elves after Gil-Galad and people like Elrond and Galadriel werent exactly king style rulers, more like great advisors of the people around them but they were fantastic</p>

<p>Not entirely sure Tolkien had the love of hardcore monarchism we seem to think he did. I think a pretty big part of it is that Tolkien understood the issues around succession and knew that nations liked strong birthright claims to stop everyone fighting over the top job (which fked Gondor over a heap of times)</p>

But the monarch shouldn‚Äôt want it and would be lazy and keep out of things as much as possible. The should only get involved to keep the government in check.</p>

<p>Then in another letter said that no human is qualified to boss other humans around, even the saintly.</p>

<p>Then said he loves his country (England) but hates the idea of a ‚ÄòBritain‚Äô. And he also despised corporate imperialism and globalism where countries or organisations tried tried to push values onto other countries.</p>

<p>Also resented that countries had adopted other countries‚Äô languages as their main language, saying it makes the world a flatter place.</p>

<p>I know he was a fan and inspired by G K Chesterton who likes to talk about some type of Distributism, which to me sounds like a reversal of Calitalism, where the main priority of the economy, society, organisations and government is geared towards the family and the most vulnerable.
Local councils/charities etc would have more say in matters affecting their communities and so on‚Ä¶. Sounds interesting.</p>

      <label for="l6afard" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s incredibly &lsquo;racist&rsquo; when Rohan people can&rsquo;t even walk up to black gate, while people from Gondor can.</p>

<p>Elvish blood being superior factor and bloodlines of numenor diluting is directly referenced.</p>

<p>LOTR is racist/monarchist when it comes to factions of men. There&rsquo;s no denying that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s awkward because different houses or factions having different characteristics because of their unique circumstances or history is justified. But, when it changes the inherent quality of people, it becomes too close to racism.</p>

<p>Normal racism is equal dudes pretending to be superior, this is like superior dudes being cool, so discrimination is justified.</p>

      <label for="l6agadu" class="commentText"><p>The black gate part is, iirc, because even young kids in Gondor grew up next to Sauron and were just used to the feelings of dread and defeat you get trying to challenge him whereas the Rohirrim were shocked</p>

<p>And yeah, wont deny that there is elements of bloodline kind of &lsquo;powers&rsquo; in people that can be inherited and diluted.</p>

<p>That <em>could</em> be seen as allegorical to racial superiority. Really though, I strongly believe that its not. Its just an extension of the worldbuilding where the men who fought for good were given gifts and an island which turn them into higher men. Men stuck in the decaying Middle Earth felt the waning of the world and men who served Morgoth had to deal with the decaying touch of evil. Morally and as spiritual beings they were equals, they just got stuck in bad/better places as part of the fantastical worldbuilding</p>

<p>Because all that was geographically based, it did end up as kind of groups of people with different attributes. Thats fair and in todays world, it could look unappealing, but I see it as much more of an extension of the world and the kind of superpower spiritual stuff going on. Explicitly all men are equal, he&rsquo;s very clear on that, Eru loves them all the same and Aragorn makes sure to sell that point to the people of the east.</p>

      <label for="l6aj1wn" class="commentText"><p>See, that&rsquo;s the point. IRL racism has normal people pretending to be genetically superior and being AHs. LOTR is other way around, it&rsquo;s actually genetically/inherently superior people being accepted as ruler class because they&rsquo;re &lsquo;nice&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Eru may love them all the same, but Valar do not. They are very biblical about who they grant favors. It was not Eastern men&rsquo;s fault that the enlightened elves didn&rsquo;t meet them and they were left to corrupt under Morgoth.</p>

<p>And the whole bible influence of needing help of Angelic beings to figure out what to do and what not to do is against the natural evolution of men.</p>

<p>LOTR is a wonderful fantasy to get lost in, but some elements are not ignorable. Tolkien denied all allegories to world wars, but influence of bible is overwhelming in the larger world and it was his deliberate choice to create a world in which angelic beings grant bloodline favours and they are racially superior due to following the angels/gods (Valar). Also, it was his choice to showcase the difference and glorify gifted people who are &lsquo;noble&rsquo; and &lsquo;kingly&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The whole &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just fantasy&rsquo; disassociation fades quickly when the material starts talking about middle earth as imaginary or lost history of our Earth.</p>

<p>Yes. Only about one thing, to my knowledge, but according to Dwayne McDuffie, he did like Justice League Unlimited&rsquo;s adaptation of &ldquo;For the Man Who Has Everything&rdquo;, which came out in 2004. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s the only adaptation of his work he hasn&rsquo;t absolutely despised.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;d recommend listening to his opinions on other people&rsquo;s work, though, which have never been one of his strong points.</p>

      <label for="l69l7w5" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that armchair psychology stuff is so annoying to read. Like if anyone does anything, you can tie it to who they are as a person by just inventing some faux-Freudian story out of thin air and claim it as deductive logic and psychology</p>

<p>Hint: It is gossip and low key slander, not psychology</p>

<p>Sometimes its harmless, like there was a thread of people wondering why Tolkien didnt overly describe the actual battles in his books and people suggested that as a vet, he wasnt a big fan of examining and glorifying actual violence. Thats totally legit, very rational suggestion</p>

<p>But doing it to actually belittle someone or lay them open to receive an -ism or -ist word, or pretend you fully understand and can read them by just spouting the first bit of intuition that comes to mind is ugly af and insulting to everyone. And it will <em>never</em> come from actual psychologists as they&rsquo;ve been taught that trying to analyse someone then sharing that analysis is <em>super</em> rude without request, as well as know you cant get jack shit info without fully knowing someone and half of what even the worlds greatest analyst would &lsquo;guess&rsquo; could be way off the mark without in-depth knowledge</p>

<p>(Not saying Moore is specifically doing this, idk the context to this quote, but ffs it is super common amongst Tolkien analysts)</p>

      <label for="l69xt2i" class="commentText"><p>As with all things, I don&rsquo;t think the truth is so black and white. Sauron could be described as an imperialist, yet the same could also be said for Gondor moving into Moria. Legolas and Gimli are used to make statements against racism, yet orcs and goblins are all portrayed as vile disgusting monsters. The Hobbits represent the &ldquo;little people&rdquo; of the world (which could be paralleled to people of a lower class in the real world), but it&rsquo;s just as easy to say the enlightened and perfect elves represent the upper class of society. And while Eowyn is written as a fierce warrior who fights the patriarchal tendencies of her society, she is very much the exception in the world. All other women in the story are placed squarely in the passive damsel box. Tolkien was making an effort to be more progressive in his writing, but it&rsquo;s not hard to see how even he fell victim to the societal standards of his time and how they bled into his writing, maybe without him even realizing.</p>

<p>Alan Moore himself has been known to fall victim to this. On the one hand he wrote V for Vendetta, on the other hand he wrote Lost Girls. Even when writers try to be progressive, the way they&rsquo;re conditioned to think about the world often bleeds into their writing. The best we can do is hope to be always moving towards better.</p>

      <label for="l6aan8c" class="commentText"><p>People never talk about the Wild Men in Lotr. Fair enough really, they don‚Äôt have much space in the story, but the as far as imperialism and racism go, it‚Äôs certainly present in the good guy‚Äôs side. Hell the Wild Man chief who leads the Rohirrim to Gondor asks, as his sole reward for his aid, that his people <em>stop</em> being hunted as animals. And it‚Äôs sort of framed as noble and equivalent exchange for Theoden to accept this deal. (Or at the very least brushed aside as if this is a normal exchange with ‚Äúlesser‚Äù people)</p>

      <label for="l6ahv1o" class="commentText"><p>Everyone always talks about the orcs, and I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs without good reason, but I‚Äôve always thought that the way the men of the east has been handled throughout the franchise had been downright onerous. The men who follow Mordor are described as swarthy, olive toned, sallow, slant-eyed, and their features are distinct from the ‚Äòfair‚Äô elves and men of the west. Near Harad (lit: near East) are deserts filled with vicious tribes, the Corsairs of Umbar are explicitly based on barbary pirates,  and the terrifying M√ªmakil the easterlings ride seem to be named after the Egyptian Mamluks. Their treachery is also long-standing, with them standing by Morgoth in the First Age, were the first to fall under Sauron‚Äôs dominion in the Second, and were the last by his side in the Third. The travels of the Blue Wizards in the East are nebulous and happen off-screen, so we never see the alleged rebellions of men against dark forces. What we do see is their constant warring against the Numenorians and then the Gondorians, and their eventual conquest by Gondor after the third age is concluded.</p>

<p>The movies are even worse on that point. Coming not long after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>, the artists for the Two Towers and Return of the King explicitly say that they took the designs for the Easterlings from Middle Eastern culture. You see Sassanid, Ottoman, Sejuk, and a sprinkling of Mongolian armor and weapons all mashed together. The Ring theme itself was supposed to have a Middle Eastern feel to it, with the intention of causing an audience used to European-style music to be unsettled or get a sense of malevolence. I think the thing that gets me the most is the competition between Gimli and Legolas in cutting them down. At least Tolkein had the decency to write of Aragorn mourning the death of an unknown harad rider.</p>

<p>Idk, much as I love the books and movies it‚Äôs always bugged me how much people want to hold Tolkein up as having views more modern than what shows up on page. He was an upper middle-class English dude born into the height of British imperial fancies. The influence that had isn‚Äôt exactly subtle, and I don‚Äôt think the emphasis on West vs East was ever an accident either.</p>

<p>Edit: Heck, Eomer even starts diplomatic ties with the Shire after WotR, through Merry. Elessar made them Councellors of the North Kingdom, essentially ruling Arnor renewed in the king&rsquo;s name. And both Merry and Pippin lived out their final years in Rohan and Gondor by invitation of their respective kings, and were eventually laid to rest besides King Elessar in the Rath Dinen. There would have been no honour higher than that for a nobleman.</p>

<p>Just because Alan Moore is a colossal fuckhead doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to misrepresent the art he&rsquo;s criticizing.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s perfectly fair to criticize LOTR&rsquo;s lack of compelling female characters. Most casual fans wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to name more than 2 women in the entire series. And while I can personally excuse the lack of female representation because it is a book written 100 years ago, doesn&rsquo;t mean that new readers have to feel the same way. And much more importantly, just because we can excuse it doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to lie and pretend like Tolkien filled his books with well-written women.</p>

Frodo is not a commoner, he&rsquo;s basically a nobleman.</p>

      <label for="l69o4v8" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôll kinda give him the misogyny one ngl. Tolkien writes women extremely well, the problem is he just doesn‚Äôt write them. Whoever a woman shows up it‚Äôs literally always a more minor role than the men and usually by a significant margin. √âowyn and L√∫thien are the only examples I can think of where the women aren‚Äôt shoved into the background and it can get tiring.</p>

<p>The issue is honestly extremely stark and almost impossible to miss, particularly the way it‚Äôs common for women to only get a tiny role for seemingly no other reason then that they are needed to produce a child, yes this is about Celebrian. Others aren‚Äôt even mentioned at all and only exist by virtue of somebody has to be this person‚Äôs mother, for example Curufin‚Äôs wife and literally any women in Legolas‚Äôs line.</p>

<p>Being good at writing women doesn‚Äôt count for much if you forget to <em>actually write them.</em></p>

      <label for="l69ty4k" class="commentText"><p>But I don&rsquo;t think you can call him a misogynist for simply not writing about them much. A female character does not have to be the main character to prove an author is not a misogynist.</p>

<p>All the female characters he&rsquo;s written are extremely well respected in his works by both the author and the male characters in the story. Tolkien does a great deal of exploring their characters and motives, and they are fleshed out and complex characters. Look at Eowyn, Galadriel, Luthien. They are all very well written, their deeds <em>mean</em> something to the grand scheme of the whole series. Their actions influence the plot incredibly despite not being the main characters of the series.</p>

<p>Look at even the interactions between some of the minor female characters and the rest of the cast. Goldberry is shown to not only be beautiful, but to be wise and merry as well, and she is very cherished by her husband. Arwen may not be a main character, but love for her is a driving force, possibly the biggest driving force, in Aragorns journey. And Arwen was the one who gave Frodo a chance to go to Valinor as thanks for all he&rsquo;d done. Galadriels wisdom and compassion helped heal the rift between dwarves and elves, and was the catalyst to Legolas and Gimlis friendship. Even Iorrenth, the healing woman, had a prominent role in helping heal Eowyn, Faramir, and Merry. And don&rsquo;t forget Rosie Cotton, the golden curled lass-with-sass that is Sam&rsquo;s true love and girl worth fighting for. Even Lobelia Sackville Baggins gave Sharkeys men a piece of her mind, beating them with her umbrella, and she was an old woman.</p>

<p>Like I said, a woman doesn&rsquo;t have to be a main character to prove the author isn&rsquo;t misogynistic. The way women are treated in the series by both the author and the characters is crucial in that assessment. I would argue that, though George r.r Martin has many women in his books, even powerful ones at points, he is incredibly misogynistic because of how the women in his series are treated by him and his male characters.</p>

<p>However with Tolkien, though the women aren&rsquo;t the main characters of this story, every woman is treated with respect, seen as a person not an object, cherished by those who love them, and admired. They are each shown to be competent in word and deed, their presence and action drives the plot many times in different ways, and the success at the end would not be achievable without them. They are all strong, beautiful, and capable in their own way as well.</p>

<p>I think that said, makes a good case for why he&rsquo;s not a misogynist.</p>

      <label for="l69qym6" class="commentText"><p>Some of those counter examples are just incorrect or weak. Everyone&rsquo;s already explained the problem with the Fordo one, and Eowyn&rsquo;s a lone example (there&rsquo;s more outside Lord of the Rings, though) and she immediately abandons her warrior life after her first major battle. Not exactly a strong case for representation when the lone female secondary warrior in a sea of male main characters, quickly decides combat&rsquo;s not for her and returns to motherhood. This is the &ldquo;I have a Black friend,&rdquo; of arguments and it&rsquo;s always piss poor.</p>

<p>A dwarf and an elf are&hellip; interesting choices to combat claims of real world racism creeping into the narratives. Almost every reference to non-white peoples are both negative and the actual problem being pointed out, not fantastical descriptions of dwarves and elves lol. They&rsquo;re always the invading hordes, siding with the overtly evil characters, and their descriptions range from describing the language of the Hardrim (themselves a blatant repetition of the nefarious, brown skinned, near east type) as being akin to the shouting of animals, to the Easterlings being called both yellow and &ldquo;swarthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s the orcs&hellip; They are, once again, dark skinned. They are also &ldquo;flat nosed&rdquo; and &ldquo;slant eyed.&rdquo; It dips into a very common and almost mundane form of ableism, too, as they are &ldquo;deformed,&rdquo; which is something almost always given to bad guys in contrast to the much superior white folk.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get people&rsquo;s insistence with denying obvious problems. It&rsquo;s ok that the things we like isn&rsquo;t flawless. It&rsquo;s ok to like a thing that has issues. You aren&rsquo;t some awful person because you like a thing that has terrible non-white dude representation. Like the stories. Love them, even. Just don&rsquo;t pretend they aren&rsquo;t products of a flawed man and time (as are a great many things).</p>

      <label for="l6a77jk" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, I can <em>kind of</em> see the &ldquo;class snobbery&rdquo; bit.</p>

<p>Frodo and Sam, while both being Hobbits, the most humble of the free peoples of Middle Earth, are both from different social classes within Hobbit society. Frodo, thanks to his adoption by Bilbo, is of the upper class, he is well-educated (he can speak some elvish) and you never hear of either he or Bilbo labouring in the field or otherwise working for a living. Even before his adventure in The Hobbit, Bilbo is seemingly well-off enough to simply live a life of leisure. Bag End is a (relatively) large and well-furnished, comfortable home. Frodo and Bilbo are among what passes for the aristocracy of the Shire. By contrast, Sam is a &ldquo;working class&rdquo; Hobbit. He and his father are gardeners (employed by the residents of Bag End to tend to the property). Iirc, there&rsquo;s a line spoken by Gaffer Gamgee in the books that Bilbo had &ldquo;learnt Sam his letters&rdquo; (i.e. he taught Sam to read and write, suggesting this isn&rsquo;t something every Hobbit child is taught). Unlike the Bagginses, the Gamgees work for a living and live in a smaller home. Even in most adaptations of the books (including Jackson&rsquo;s movies), the class distinction is highlighted by the differing ways that Frodo and Sam speak. Sam, in most adaptations, speaks with a pronounced &ldquo;West country&rdquo; English accent, an accent traditionally associated with rural areas and farm workers (and pirates thanks to Robert Newton who played Long John Silver in the 1950 Disney adaptation of Treasure Island, he basically codified the classic &ldquo;pirate voice&rdquo; with his &ldquo;West country&rdquo; accent). Frodo meanwhile is usually well-spoken and most adaptations have him speak in &ldquo;Recieved Pronunciation&rdquo; or RP English, which is associated with the English upper class and educated elites.</p>

<p>Sam, the &ldquo;working class&rdquo; Hobbit, then spends the books/movies loyally following Frodo, the &ldquo;upper class&rdquo; Hobbit, helping carry his burdens (not even talking about the Ring) and often referring to Frodo as his &ldquo;master.&rdquo; Obviously, there&rsquo;s more to the relationship between Frodo and Sam than a &ldquo;master-servant&rdquo; dynamic. They are genuine friends that go through hell together, and if their situations were reversed, I&rsquo;m sure Frodo would be every bit as supportive of Sam as Sam was of him. However, there is an underlying class aspect. Tolkien was born in 1892, and based the Shire on his youth in the rural &ldquo;West country&rdquo; of England so its probably a bit much to expect Tolkien to have conceived of the Shire as some classless utopia where everyone is equal. There&rsquo;s just some stuff that was understandably ingrained due to his generation and background. The bonus features on the DVDs of Jackson&rsquo;s films also acknowledge the class differences between Frodo and Sam and even compare it to the relationship between an officer and his batman (a military dynamic that Tolkien would have understood due to his service in WW1). Military officers, typically of the upper class would have a &ldquo;batman,&rdquo; a non-officer soldier (usually working class) who would essentially act as the officer&rsquo;s manservant and valet. In this comparison, Frodo is an officer, while Sam is his batman. Again, though it should be stressed that Sam isn&rsquo;t simply a loyal servant without any agency of his own and he plays an important role in supporting Frodo through his journey. The fact that Moore just sees &ldquo;class snobbery&rdquo; shows that he hasn&rsquo;t really bothered to look beyond the surface level of Frodo and Sam&rsquo;s relationship.</p>

      <label for="l6a6fen" class="commentText"><p>Look, I love lord of the rings, but I feel like I understand what he&rsquo;s about here so I&rsquo;ll try and voice it the interest of the discussion. Don&rsquo;t be one of those insufferable fanboys who gets personally offended because someone said something mean about your nerdy hobbies, be an adult and use it as a cause for reflection while understanding that your media consumption habits are not your entire personality. Art is FOR thought and reflection.</p>

<p><strong>Imperialism:</strong> Lord of the Rings was created by a nationalistic British man while the British empire was still very much alive, kicking, and murdering the indigenous of the world. Lord of the Rings could be very easily argued to traffic in imperialist depictions of &lsquo;The West&rsquo; vs the swarthy hordes of foreign barbarians who are somehow innately less moral, less wise, and more prone to lower levels of self-consciousness that lends itself to evil. The West is literally the only part of the entire middle earth that hadn&rsquo;t fallen to the forces of abject and one-dimensional evil. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be true, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/14c6utb/why_the_other_peoples_of_middle_earth_accepted/" target="_blank">I even made a post giving a different explanation</a>, but it&rsquo;s absolutely something that&rsquo;s there and has to be reckoned with and I don&rsquo;t begrudge anyone for finding his treatment of the non-Western cultures of his world sus. Imperialism isn&rsquo;t just &lsquo;big bad guy do conquest&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s an entire cultural framework that for someone like Tolkien was almost certainly inescapable. Although even in the least charitable interpretations, he was more progressive than a lot of his contemporaries.</p>

<p><strong>Racism:</strong> Went into it above, but there&rsquo;s also a ton of very suspicious talk of &lsquo;stock&rsquo; in the books which makes it pretty clear that Tolkien had some very antiquated ideas about genetics that are not very well-received today. This is another aspect of the books that is objectively there and you have to decide how you feel about it.</p>

<p><strong>Class Snobbery:</strong> You picked a terrible example in Frodo and Sam. Frodo is a useless upper class layabout that literally doesn&rsquo;t even have a job and has everything in his life just given to him, but is treated by everyone and the story itself as a superior being by nature of his birth despite him doing absolutely nothing to earn it, similarly to other Hobbits who are given privileged treatment both in and out of universe simply for existing within the upper class of the Shire. Sam&rsquo;s working class humility borders on obsequiousness, he&rsquo;s portrayed as the ideal working man who is servile, submissive, endlessly dutiful, has no will of his own, and is undyingly loyal to his &lsquo;master&rsquo; who gives him NOTHING in return even to the point of giving him his life. Like his loyalty to Frodo is COMPLETELY irrational except that he&rsquo;s totally cucked to his class position and believes in his innate superiority as some kind of weird Shire noble. His admirable working class ideal is that he knows his place and pathetically accepts his own yoke without complaining or doing something unsightly, like advocating for his own interests. Honestly it struck me reading the books vs watching the movies that Hobbit society is actually pretty fucking awful.</p>

<p><strong>Misogyny:</strong> If I were to disagree with one, this would probably be it because while Tolkien&rsquo;s female characters are few and far between, I generally like them a lot. What I think he&rsquo;s getting at here is that they&rsquo;re only allowed to be valorized if they aspire to maleness, basically, which is absolutely a good point. Galadriel&rsquo;s epithet is literally the &lsquo;man-maiden&rsquo;. Eowyn is heroic because she refuses to be relegated to the domain of the feminine and rebukes it in favor of masculine achievement. I&rsquo;m also not much of an expert on gender stuff so I have the least to say about this compared to race and class, but I see his argument.</p>

<p>Gollum was legitimately the most useful of the 3, sorry Sam but Gollum is a hard carry (guy skulked around Mordor alone literally for years before he was caught). If he had actually been genuine about helping, he&rsquo;d have made an equally great member of the 3, such a shame</p>
