      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dopklj/the_rockets_only_returned_the_2025_draft_swap_and/"><p>The Rockets only returned the 2025 draft swap and the 2026 draft pick to the Nets, but retain their 2027 draft swap. This effectively gives the Nets only a 2 year tanking window, or accept a &ldquo;dud&rdquo; year.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Not sure if this is ultimately some insane 4D chess, but the Nets so far have had 0 incentives to tank because that would only improve the picks for Houston. However, the Nets are now clearly going to go into tank mode, but they only have a 2 year window to do so.</p>

<p>In practically all recent successful tanks, and even unsuccessful tanks, none have been completed in 2 years. All have taken at least 3 years or more. The Rockets only giving back 2025 and 2026 pick controls to the Nets effectively means that the Net can actively tank and trade away their best players, but only for 2 years. After that, they either need to &ldquo;complete&rdquo; the tank or accept that they might need to give away a top pick for a one year.</p>

<p>The Nets completing their tank in 2 years is unlikely, so if the Nets want to go win now in 2 year, the likely scenario is the Nets will be trading away their own picks and Knicks picks to pick up a disgruntled star.</p>

<p>Nets were also hoping for a Spida deal which seemed less and less likely which might have helped make the decision to tank the more logical move.</p>

<p>Just a case of HOU still had BKN over a barrel when it came to the Mikal trade, but well done to them for getting out of it well. HOU just had a position where they couldn&rsquo;t really lose. The threat of BKN going all in and ruining the picks just wasn&rsquo;t feasible with Simmons on a max contract still.</p>

<p>the rockets didn’t see much value in that  picks-wise — considering we already have an excess of youth — so helping catalyze the Big Trade for a return on win-now trade assets along with gambling on the suns’ downfall isn’t necessarily the worst move.</p>

<p>you really don’t find shit like this in other sports and it’s what keeps basketball intriguing for fans of the game.</p>

Or any of their other mediocre but highly trabeable (salary wise) players. The Pistons, Wizards and Raptors are all likely tanking next year too. Bulls also look to be finally. Hornets will be better but another Lamelo injury plus if Bridges leaves could derail that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that easy to be at the very bottom of the East, but it&rsquo;s not that hard to be the 7-8th seed. Nets could have done it with a couple upgrades and they had the assets to do it.</p>

<p>Houston has been begging them to take their picks back for months anyway. That report that the Rockets were willing to trade the nets their picks back for Mikal dates back to last year or something</p>

<p>It was a smart move. Ben Simmons expires next year to the tune of <span class="math inline">\(40 million. After the nets clean house they would have like \)</span>80 million in cap space to sign someone, possibly a solid pick next year and maybe Cam Thomas/Claxton take the next Step.</p>

<p>Finally deciding to be smart with their decisions. It’s time to tank and not hold Mikal hostage. Ultimately the rockets were willing to give them their picks back and that’s what matters in the long run</p>

<p>Nets retain the Suns 2025 1st since Houston can only Swap that year.</p>

<p>2029 (depending on how things shake out) the Rockets could end up with the Mav’s 1st and Swap Rights with Suns because it’s a Get 1 Swap 1 Trade.</p>

<p>That would mean in 2029 the Nets would retain the Suns 1st with Houston just having Swap Rights.</p>

<p>It only worked because they picked up a 1st pick within those 2 years. Even if you were the worse team in the league, odds of 1st pick is only 14%. If you had a 2 year window to tank, you might end up like Detroit (back to back 5th picks as the worse team in the league). In fact, ending up with back to back 5th picks is statistically more likely to happen than getting a 1st pick in 2 seasons of being the worse team in the league.</p>

If the Pistons had that pick they very easily could have been sold on the allure of Jabari’s shooting and let Paolo slip into the later picks. So maybe the team got lucky, but you also have to have good scouting to know when a high level talent is there, otherwise you’re picking Anthony Bennett 1st overall, then that pick means nothing.</p>

<p>Rockets Swap with Suns in 2025 so the Nets still retain the 1st it’s just likely going to be the OKC pick since they have Swap Rights with Rockets Top 11 Protected before they Swap with Suns 1st.</p>

Harden was needed. KD and Kyrie weren’t enough and wouldn’t ever be enough. Harden completed them.</p>

<p>The problem is, dedicating your franchise to the hopes of very egotistical stars that have had some <strong>very</strong> detailed issues with their personalities. Which resulted in some brutal trades (Harden to Philly/Kyrie to Dallas) bc you have no choice but to give into those stars.</p>

<p>Marks deserves blame for that era bc he was simply apart of it and anyone involved deserves blame for how it all unfolded but the extreme hate for him was so blind. Now that we’ve finally picked a direction I fully trust him to turn this over well</p>

<p>there was a piece from Sarah Todd about how teams have like 400+ names in their database of high school prospects they&rsquo;re keeping info on, and having meetings about the 26-27 class a couple days ago: <a href="https://www.deseret.com/sports/2024/06/21/utah-jazz-prep-for-2024-nba-draft-danny-ainge-justin-zanik/" target="_blank">https://www.deseret.com/sports/2024/06/21/utah-jazz-prep-for-2024-nba-draft-danny-ainge-justin-zanik/</a></p>

      <label for="labg0ek" class="commentText"><p>Picks lose most of their value by late lottery. Even if the Rockets are another .500 team in 2027 and the Nets go from like pick 6 to 12, that&rsquo;s still a huge drop from an asset standpoint. Perhaps the Rockets was asking for too much, but if I were the Nets I&rsquo;d have offered 2 of the more recent Knicks picks (the ones guaranteed to be low) to get that swap back.</p>

<p>The #12 picks blow the #6 picks out of the water. you can still get a solid to great player at 12. and 6 is no guarantee</p>

      <label for="labezgq" class="commentText"><p>Me either but if Jalen can develop more consistency and Sengun can bulk up without losing his finesse and Jabari and Amen can develop their shots, along with Tari and Cam they could make noise.  Amen made a jump when we started using him correctly.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a lot of ifs.  They&rsquo;re young and we can&rsquo;t truly determine how they&rsquo;ll develop but we need a lot to go right.</p>

They’ve got picks and there are a lot of teams coming next season with players who will probably be ready to bounce if the season doesn’t go their way.  They’ll have big cap space for 2025 off-season, they’re going to use those picks to get to land some bigger fishes.</p>
