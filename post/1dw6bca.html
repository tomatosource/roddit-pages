<blockquote>
<p>Three main takeaways I&rsquo;ve heard in reporting on Utah&rsquo;s ongoing willingness to field calls from teams interested in highly coveted forward Lauri Markkanen … after an aggressive recent pursuit by Golden State to acquire him and discussions with other teams such as Sacramento, San Antonio, Miami and New Orleans:</p>

<p>The Jazz can&rsquo;t use their $30-plus million in projected salary cap space to renegotiate and extend Markkanen&rsquo;s contract until Aug. 6, so Utah is incentivized to take every call in the interim and keep listening to pitches. That approach does no apparent harm. It also generates lots of good intel for them. The Jazz, with Danny Ainge as CEO, were always going to do this even if they are serious about keeping Markkanen.</p>

<p>More than one rival team has shared the observation that it would be difficult for the Jazz to trade him in the short term — even if they wanted to — because Markkanen is entering the final season of his current contract at a mere $18 million. It obviously complicates Jazz efforts to get a trade package in return for Markkanen on the level of Brooklyn&rsquo;s haul for Mikal Bridges when Markkanen is not under team control for more than a season and when his salary is relatively low. They have a much better chance to command a Bridges-style offer filled with future draft picks like New York agreed to furnish the Nets if Markkanen, 27, is signed to an extension.</p>

<p>At least one team that has shown interest in Markkanen is projecting confidence that the Jazz will indeed trade Markkanen in the near future even if they extend him</p>

      <label for="lbsj8ml" class="commentText"><p>Part of that is the exceeded expectations early on that year. Hardy is a good coach and he turned Lauri into an all-star quick. Conley and Olynyk were also huge for them. I 100% think they planned on tanking, but they were far too good early to really do it. This past season makes no sense to me though. If they want a top 5 pick then they need to move some guys before the season starts</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why they did the same thing last year, though.  But it didn&rsquo;t really even matter, the Hawks and Rockets were both better than us and still jumped us.</p>

      <label for="lbsykzy" class="commentText"><p>This is a result of Danny Ainge&rsquo;s ideological approach of &lsquo;optionality&rsquo;. He has often talked about it, but basically as a team you want players to do multiple things, as an organization you want to be able to choose different paths based on what you have. They are good half a season because they need the more senior players to see what they have in the young players. Throwing cade out as your oldest player on the floor doesn&rsquo;t really tell the pistons what they have in Cade. Now they have a pretty strong idea of what peak Markannen is like because he got to play with real pros like conley and olynyk.</p>

<p>Then make Sexton the tank commander this season, let him drop 27 a night and then deal him too.</p>

      <label for="lbsvmqu" class="commentText"><p>He hasn&rsquo;t suggested Markannen can be traded as soon as August. just that he can sign extension in august.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That could be tomorrow or <strong>months from now if</strong> the Jazz raise Markkanen&rsquo;s salary and then sign him to a <strong>contract extension once they are allowed to do so in early August.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says months from now to make it clear that there&rsquo;ll be a waiting period after extension.</p>

<p>Anyway the rule is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ams are permitted to extend-and-trade players, but such extensions are limited to <strong>no more than a five percent raise and two additional seasons.</strong> Anything larger includes a <strong>six-month no-trade restriction</strong></p>

And Minnesota had a super toxic locker room and then we gave them a route to dump Russell and gave them Mike Conley, best teammate in the league. It made them better in a year where we had their pick. And it wasn&rsquo;t even an unprotected first from the Lakers. It was bad. Thankfully we still got Keyonte from their pick that year but Minnesota was in a weird spot before that trade. We gave them NAW too lol. It was bad</p>

<p>This would have to push Dort/Caruso to the bench and move J Dub to the 2 as you’re not gonna pay IHart $30M to come off the bench. Lauri would have to play the 3 which he certainly can do, though I’d say he’s better as a 4.</p>

<p>It could definitely work and there’s obviously much more potential maneuverability than what I mentioned above. I’m just saying I think OKC will likely sit this one out.</p>

      <label for="lbso15x" class="commentText"><p>I would absolutely hate it, but it feels like they have the best reasonable chance. If they offer Kuminga or Podziemski + Moody + a few picks I have a hard time seeing how the Jazz say no. And that wouldn&rsquo;t hurt the Warriors current window whatsoever, compared to eg. the Kings offering Murray + something. The latter might be a more enticing deal, but the Kings won&rsquo;t offer it because Murray is critical to their current window/plans. Kuminga/Podz are positive contributors for the Warriors, but won&rsquo;t be critical pieces on the timeline of Steph and Draymond&rsquo;s remaining careers</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t make alot of sense to keep him, he&rsquo;s 27 this year and they have zero players right now who look like they&rsquo;ll be a star. Hell I don&rsquo;t even know if they have anyone who looks like they&rsquo;ll even be a great player for their core. It&rsquo;s gonna take a couple of years to out a team together to compete and Lauri will be like 30 by the time they get good (and actively helping them win games which hurts their draft stock).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fumble the bag Ainge by being greedy. Extending Lauri and keeping him is not the move.</p>

      <label for="lbsj8bd" class="commentText"><p>At his current salary number, he can’t get a max extension (extensions can only be 140% more than the last year of the contract).</p>

<p>That’s the entire situation with the renegotiate and extend approach the Jazz are taking. However, after you extend a player, you can’t trade them for 6 months. And that would be <em>very</em> close to the trade deadline (if not after, I thought Lauri is extension eligible August 27 at the earliest). There have also been reports that Lauri and his camp wants to test free agency to better control where he plays — that ability to choose will cost him 15MM (since that’s the raise he would need to get this summer for the max extension).</p>

<p>TL;DR is that Lauri’s freedom to choose his future isn’t free. He either takes the 15M raise + extension and let the Jazz trade him to whomever produces the best offer. Or he waits it out and hits FA (and the Jazz potentially trade him at the deadline anyways)</p>

      <label for="lbsgxyl" class="commentText"><p>Then you’re silly lmao. One of the best shooters in the league, incredible athlete, seven footer that moves like he’s 6’8”</p>

<p>Lauri’s only real blemish is his lack of playmaking, but if he’s the 2nd or 3rd option on a team that’s not a huge issue</p>

<p>Edit: actually in thinking about it his lack of self creation off the dribble is probably the bigger flaw in his game. That and lack of playmaking are what hold him back from being a superstar.</p>

<p>Lauri probably won’t be making any all-defense teams in his career but he’s a net positive on the defensive end. He’s a great help defender when he’s playing the 4 and he even held his own at the 5 for the Jazz pretty well the past two seasons</p>

<p>Lauri is their long-term extra scoring option if they trade for him&hellip; Having him in that max slot enables roster flexibility with his would-be new salary and tons of draft picks if they ever need to move him, they could easily grab a different all-star/all-nba player.</p>

<p>I swear this sub gets dumber and dumber.</p>

<p>Lauri is better than Dort/Caruso/iHart</p>

The Jazz would be giving the Heat Lauri for free in this instance, as The Heat only have 1 first, and 2 swaps that they can trade.
