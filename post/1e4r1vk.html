      <label for="ldgn6oa" class="commentText"><p>its so wild that Nate Robinson thought he was on a kidney transplant waiting list all this time — receiving dialysis for 3 years — only to find out he was never on a list. only reason for him realizing this was a reader in April reaching out to the Texas Kidney Foundation asking them to reach out to Nate</p>

<p>and then there&rsquo;s the juxtaposition of these quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Robinson was taken aback. His NBA career had just started &ndash; and now it was in jeopardy?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing basketball,&rdquo; he told Callahan. &ldquo;If it happens, it happens. If I die doing what I love, then so be it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robinson&rsquo;s kidneys were not functioning properly, but, more than that, the doctors told him he would eventually need a kidney transplant. Robinson nodded, believing that &ldquo;eventually&rdquo; could be years away. For now, he just wanted to play.</p>

<p>He began taking blood pressure medication and agreed to getting checked often.</p>

<p>Over the years, this became his routine. On rare occasions, he&rsquo;d become violently ill and need to visit the hospital, but he said he only ever missed two games &ndash; total.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>Robinson also looks back at what he did &ndash; and didn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could go back to the beginning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish I would&rsquo;ve just gotten a kidney my rookie year, and I would&rsquo;ve just sat out for however long I needed to sit out to get healthy and have been done with it.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="ldgq7qr" class="commentText"><p>This is particularly shocking. That he thought he was on the list for starters, and secondly that he&rsquo;s been dealing with kidney issues from his rookie season. Taking all that in is just jarring.</p>

      <label for="ldjga8a" class="commentText"><p>Very unfortunate. I don’t know his case but his story is the same as a lot of patients I’ve taken care of in dialysis.</p>

<p>Many patients are in denial and/or lack the funds to see a primary doctor to track their health. He, as a lifelong athlete, seems like he didn’t listen to medical advice he was given. They have physicals in HS, college and even more so in the NBA level, especially during trades or signings. I find it difficult to believe that no one on any college or NBA team’s medical staff didn’t have this conversation with him when physicals were done.</p>

<p>What he says regarding his diagnosis tracks with what I’ve seen with patients who are noncompliant with their treatments or medications. For him to say he thought he was on the transplant list, and wasn’t, is a possibility but then again, reading his comments make me believe that he wasn’t interested in his care as much as he should’ve been. Transplant centers will send out letters telling patients what they need, if they’ve been denied, or when they’ve been accepted. His dialysis team (SW, RN, RD, MD) should also communicate with him regarding how he’s doing during dialysis or what else he needs to optimize his health.</p>

<p>Dialysis due to hypertension could’ve been prevented or delayed due to timely meds and physicals by a nephrologist, if he even had one. Again, this is a multimillionaire, world class, athlete. The access to care they have, while in the NBA, will and always be more than the common person.</p>

<p>Sauce: I treat dialysis patients.</p>

<p>Also, weren&rsquo;t they printing organs like 5 years ago? What happened to that?</p>
