      <p>From <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/the-celtics-define-greatness-in-any-era" target="_blank">his sports illustrated interview</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last offseason, after a disappointing conference finals loss to the Miami Heat, the Celtics shook things up. Marcus Smart, Robert Williams and Malcolm Brogdon were out. Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis were in. Holiday added versatility to an already stingy defense. Porzingis, a 7&rsquo;‚Äâ2&rdquo; floor spacer, helped power a historically good offense.</p>

<p>The result was a 64-win season and a franchise-best 16‚Äì3 run through the playoffs. ‚ÄúThe toughest part about winning this championship is that Smart isn‚Äôt here and Rob isn‚Äôt here,‚Äù Tatum says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm so happy that we have Jrue and KP. Those guys obviously took us to the next level.‚Äù</p>

Kidd kept giving him minutes because he surely couldn&rsquo;t be THAT bad, but no, at some point he automatically lose the Mavs a game whenever he was out there too long.</p>

      <label for="lf0prnk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, FRPs were absolutely not involved in those trades whatsoever. I understand this misconception from you since Heat‚Äôs FO didn‚Äôt offer any picks of value.</p>

<p>If we summarise as of now, they got Ayton, Avdija, a FRP from either Celtics or Bucks in 2029 (they will keep the higher pick and send a lower one to Washington), Camara, Rob (may still be traded to a contender in need of a back-up defensive big good for 20 mpg) and rights to swap picks with Bucks in 28 and 30. Considering Bucks salary cap situation and the current roster, they are very extremely likely to be mediocre (if Giannis stays) to bad (if he leaves) in 5 years.</p>

<p>Sorry, an offer of Herro, some more salary filler, Jovic, a FRP and a couple of swaps in, say, 28 and 30 from a team that has Bam entering his prime and is known as a decent FA destination (unlike Milwaukee) is just not as good.</p>

<p>That was a trade for Avdija, whose upside Blazers really like, combined with the contract he is signed to, unlike Herro. They did trade out essentially 2 FRPs for him, but one is in a weak draft. Mavs were reportedly ready to offer 1 or even 2 FRPs for him, so competition was pretty fierce.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt really true. Jrue has better ball handling, Court vision, and is a way better scorer at ever level, so defenses respect him more which leads to more openings for teammates.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve wasted way too much time doing the numbers on it, but smart was always very deferential to better players and his high attempt games almost always came when the Celtics were missing multiple players with injury.</p>

<p>Smart took a lot of bad looking shots because he was a bad shooter so he got left open so the ball would find its way to him late in the shot clock. And he would get stuck with the ball because he doesn‚Äôt have the same playmaking or court vision that jrue does. EDIT: also adding in that he was one of the only players to be consistently active off-ball on what were some frustratingly stagnant offenses. Perfect example is the Derrick white tip in against Miami in 2023: the play was for Tatum but Miami blew it up and Celtics were about to get a 5 second violation. Smart was the only one to recognize the play was fucked and get to open space, so he ends up taking the last second three. Everyone talks like he was being selfish shooting that but the alternative was a turnover.</p>

<p>But the narrative that smart thought he should be the man or something was always bullshit</p>

      <label for="lf0mlmd" class="commentText"><p>The 2024 Celtics had a full season of mazulla. Honestly idk for sure if 2022 Celtics would‚Äôve won this year because the team this year just felt different since training camp and they executed everything really well. Jaylen and others have said numerous times that they went over a ton of different situations during practice that they always felt they were the smarter team. And as fans we could tell.</p>

<p>Overall  I think the 2024 team was way more focused on the little things and paid more attention to detail than 2022</p>

      <label for="lf0owej" class="commentText"><p>The 2022 Celtics were one of the best defenses ever in the 2nd half of 2022 after starting 18-21 and getting the 2-seed. They faced the KD/Kyrie Nets, defending champion Bucks, and the #1 seed Heat before finally running out of steam in the Finals. Smart also won DPOY, so it&rsquo;s not like he was some bum. His playmaking was super-important, too, since Tatum had not expanded that area of his game.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that this year&rsquo;s team was better healthy than the 2022 team, but it&rsquo;s extremely likely that team wins easily if given the same path as this year&rsquo;s team. This year&rsquo;s team didn&rsquo;t even need KP to go 16-3 in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lf0ruly" class="commentText"><p>That playmaking point is why they don‚Äôt win though. His playmaking was super important not because he was super great at it but because it was somewhat of a weakness for everyone else. Minnesota struggled against Dallas because they had that same issue. Jrue is probably as good if not better as a playmaker than Smart. He just doesn‚Äôt need to lead the team at it because Tatum improved and they added DWhite.</p>

<p>Brown and Tatum in 2024 are much much more complete and refined players than 2022.</p>

Barely ever caught guys missing switches, throwing in unique looks like JT at the 5 to disrupt the lobs vs. Dallas, a lot of pre-switching, game plans tailor made for the opponent, trusting guys to do their jobs 1v1. It&rsquo;s wild to say this about a team with the highest offensive rating of all time but the defense won that chip and the coaching was a huge part of that.</p>

<p>2022 Jaylen Brown also is not the same as 2024 Jaylen Brown. I‚Äôm sure people will try diving into the numbers but Brown became a much better post player, relentless attacking, and better defender. Those qualities that were super important against Luka.</p>

<p>Tatum also is a better playmaker now than he was back then. Without White or Jrue, that playmaking would make problems somewhat similar to what Minnesota had. Smart was a decent playmaker, but idk if he was good enough.</p>

<p>The main difference is that we played the mavs, pacers, heat (no lucky shooting) and a Cleveland team without Mitchell.</p>

<p>These are like +2 teams in terms of schedule strength adjusted net rating and none of them outside of the heat can force JB into playing turnoverball.</p>

<p>For reference the KD+Kyrie nets were like a +14 with both of them playing.</p>

If the Bucks in 2021 had lost it would&rsquo;ve been attributed to Giannis&rsquo;s knee injury, but he played through it and won so it was a non-issue. (I&rsquo;m pretty sure Chris Paul turned out to be hurt in that finals? Not really sure) You mentioned Tatum in 2022, and there&rsquo;s still the 2016 Steph argument. At some point, if you&rsquo;re playing, you&rsquo;re healthy unless you really clearly are a shell of yourself (Kawhi this year, Tatum in game 7 against the Heat last year), and Luka was putting up crazy enough numbers for me to think that his injuries were inconveniencing him than they were actually lowering his performance significantly.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd say he was pretty important to Celtics being essentially unbeatable for even an elite team (even a fully healthy Luka most likely would not be enough if KP is also healthy), but obviously Boston was good enough even without KP to take care of merely good to great teams you guys faced in the East due to injuries.</p>

<p>He was much more of the point guard than the year and a half prior. Brogdon had more of a role in the offense. It was even revealed that before Ime was fired the plan was to have white off the bench with Brogdon starting (and it&rsquo;s one of the reasons White loves Joe so much)</p>

      <label for="lf173wh" class="commentText"><p>This is why Joel Embiid&rsquo;s tweet is funny to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the Bucks give Boston the championship&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Well, Jrue was a huge help, but DWhite was just as important. And we got DWhite by trading Romeo (and JRich), who we got as a throw in with the 3rd overall, for the 1st pick in the draft we took Tatum.</p>

<p>So really, Bucks going for Dame made Jrue available for Brogdon (who we got from Indy, for Nesmith) and Rob but Philly directly gave us Tatum AND DWhite.</p>

<p>The Nets obviously got us Kyrie (DAL sleeper agent - because he sucks in Boston), Smart (KP now) &amp; Brown.</p>

<p>So Brooklyn, Philly and Indy/Milwaukee (Jrue) all got dicked in this process. Although Nesmith looks good on the Pacers, I&rsquo;m glad it all worked out the way it did. Even choosing Ime was a blessed move because it got us experience we might not have gotten if they hired Billups or Ham &amp; it made way for Mazzulla.</p>

      <label for="lf18yt0" class="commentText"><p>The reason it felt like Smart took so many shots is because teams left him open at the end of games, so the ball generally ended up finding him for shots in those spots.</p>

<p>I still have no idea why he never played in the post outside of a few random possessions throughout each game. He often had 4 shooters around him in crunch time, and could overpower almost any guard in those spots &ndash; I think it would&rsquo;ve solved a lot of issues with the Smart Celtics crunch time offense to give him some post touches at the end of games instead of just in meaningless first quarter spots.</p>

In terms of strictly defense, sure, but for the most part I think it‚Äôs pretty well understood Jrue Holiday is a better player than Marcus smart, like essentially his entire career.</p>

Partly because of him and partly because of the clippers in general were hated. I feel like he was the most hated on that team. CP3 had his haters too but he had a lot of fans as well. I‚Äôm sure their were Celtics fans who were used to disliking him like many people did and then when he joined the Celtics way passed his prime it was just kinda whatever.</p>

      <label for="lf0pndq" class="commentText"><p>People keep comparing Smart to Jrue - and that&rsquo;s understandable - but he was traded for KP who ended up missing almost all of the playoffs. I love KP, but the team would have had both Jrue and Smart (and White) rather than just Jrue for the run.</p>

<p>The upgrade was really from Brogdon to Jrue, for the playoffs anyway. People have a misconception that Smart wasn&rsquo;t willing to sacrifice anything because he had legitimately become the 3rd best player on the team, but Smart consistently did whatever was asked of him to help the team overachieve for years. Honestly, Brogdon was the one who seemed to be the most selfish. There&rsquo;s a reason Brad was so quick to ship him and Grant off and that Tatum didn&rsquo;t mention those guys.</p>

      <label for="lf2vfco" class="commentText"><p>And he sucked when he wasn&rsquo;t injured ü§£ü§£ü§£. I can tell someone doesn&rsquo;t watch games. Also, evaluating defense is one of the hardest things to do, especially at the guard spot. There aren&rsquo;t good stats that really elucidate true defensive value. Winning DPOY was more a result of Boston having an outstanding team defense with elite defenders at every position. They were top 2 in defense again this year after Smart left. I can tell you aren&rsquo;t a Grizzlies fan. What are you Smart&rsquo;s lap dog?</p>

      <label for="lf0lp0t" class="commentText"><p>Basically the team is not owned by one person (cause that would be hella expensive) so it&rsquo;s a group of guys that all own a certain percentage and together they form the majority ownership of the team. Some of those guys have decided they want to sell now. What I mean with it will likely be a similar ownership group is that the whole group will probably not be replaced but rather a new group will be formed with some of the current owners and some new owners. At least that&rsquo;s my understanding maybe someone more knowledgeable can correct/expand on this</p>

      <label for="lf05v7f" class="commentText"><p>Smart is the most mythical player ever. Everything he brings is supposedly intangible. ‚ÄúHeart‚Äù ‚ÄúDawg‚Äù ‚ÄúLeadership‚Äù ‚ÄúHustle‚Äù. Taking touches away from him was the best thing they ever did. Hes a role player who was in too big a role.</p>

<p>Boston fans worshipped him before he left despite the fact he was obviously holding them back. The ultimate indictment on their ability to evaluate talent</p>

<p>Steven‚Äôs jettisoning him for KP and two first rounders is absolute highway robbery. I‚Äôll never get over it. KP is 20/7/2 on elite efficiency and more impactful defense</p>
