      <p>From <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/the-celtics-define-greatness-in-any-era" target="_blank">his sports illustrated interview</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last offseason, after a disappointing conference finals loss to the Miami Heat, the Celtics shook things up. Marcus Smart, Robert Williams and Malcolm Brogdon were out. Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis were in. Holiday added versatility to an already stingy defense. Porzingis, a 7&rsquo;‚Äâ2&rdquo; floor spacer, helped power a historically good offense.</p>

<p>The result was a 64-win season and a franchise-best 16‚Äì3 run through the playoffs. ‚ÄúThe toughest part about winning this championship is that Smart isn‚Äôt here and Rob isn‚Äôt here,‚Äù Tatum says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm so happy that we have Jrue and KP.

      <label for="lf0prnk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, FRPs were absolutely not involved in those trades whatsoever. I understand this misconception from you since Heat‚Äôs FO didn‚Äôt offer any picks of value.</p>

<p>If we summarise as of now, they got Ayton, Avdija, a FRP from either Celtics or Bucks in 2029 (they will keep the higher pick and send a lower one to Washington), Camara, Rob (may still be traded to a contender in need of a back-up defensive big good for 20 mpg) and rights to swap picks with Bucks in 28 and 30. Considering Bucks salary cap situation and the current roster, they are very extremely likely to be mediocre (if Giannis stays) to bad (if he leaves) in 5 years.</p>

<p>Sorry, an offer of Herro, some more salary filler, Jovic, a FRP and a couple of swaps in, say, 28 and 30 from a team that has Bam entering his prime and is known as a decent FA destination (unlike Milwaukee) is just not as good.</p>

      <label for="lf0mlmd" class="commentText"><p>The 2024 Celtics had a full season of mazulla. Honestly idk for sure if 2022 Celtics would‚Äôve won this year because the team this year just felt different since training camp and they executed everything really well. Jaylen and others have said numerous times that they went over a ton of different situations during practice that they always felt they were the smarter team. And as fans we could tell.</p>

<p>Overall  I think the 2024 team was way more focused on the little things and paid more attention to detail than 2022</p>

      <label for="lf0owej" class="commentText"><p>The 2022 Celtics were one of the best defenses ever in the 2nd half of 2022 after starting 18-21 and getting the 2-seed. They faced the KD/Kyrie Nets, defending champion Bucks, and the #1 seed Heat before finally running out of steam in the Finals. Smart also won DPOY, so it&rsquo;s not like he was some bum. His playmaking was super-important, too, since Tatum had not expanded that area of his game.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that this year&rsquo;s team was better healthy than the 2022 team, but it&rsquo;s extremely likely that team wins easily if given the same path as this year&rsquo;s team. This year&rsquo;s team didn&rsquo;t even need KP to go 16-3 in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lf0ruly" class="commentText"><p>That playmaking point is why they don‚Äôt win though. His playmaking was super important not because he was super great at it but because it was somewhat of a weakness for everyone else. Minnesota struggled against Dallas because they had that same issue. Jrue is probably as good if not better as a playmaker than Smart. He just doesn‚Äôt need to lead the team at it because Tatum improved and they added DWhite.</p>

<p>Brown and Tatum in 2024 are much much more complete and refined players than 2022.</p>

I am really rooting for the guy this coming year.</p>

      <label for="lf0rg1n" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôm not completely sure The 2022 Celtics win. Rob or Smart completely change the landscape of how Dallas can defend because there‚Äôs a non shooter and a mediocre shooter on the floor.</p>

<p>2022 Jaylen Brown also is not the same as 2024 Jaylen Brown. I‚Äôm sure people will try diving into the numbers but Brown became a much better post player, relentless attacking, and better defender. Those qualities that were super important against Luka.</p>

<p>Tatum also is a better playmaker now than he was back then. Without White or Jrue, that playmaking would make problems somewhat similar to what Minnesota had. Smart was a decent playmaker, but idk if he was good enough.</p>

      <label for="lf0voby" class="commentText"><p>Jaylen brown probably still isn‚Äôt a guy who can be put out there without Tatum in the playoffs and succeed.</p>

<p>The main difference is that we played the mavs, pacers, heat (no lucky shooting) and a Cleveland team without Mitchell.</p>

<p>These are like +2 teams in terms of schedule strength adjusted net rating and none of them outside of the heat can force JB into playing turnoverball.</p>

<p>For reference the KD+Kyrie nets were like a +14 with both of them playing.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd say he was pretty important to Celtics being essentially unbeatable for an elite team (even a fully healthy Luka most likely would not be enough if KP is also healthy), but obviously Boston was good enough even without KP to take care of merely good to great teams you guys faced in the East.</p>

      <label for="lf0pndq" class="commentText"><p>People keep comparing Smart to Jrue - and that&rsquo;s understandable - but he was traded for KP who ended up missing almost all of the playoffs. I love KP, but the team would have had both Jrue and Smart (and White) rather than just Jrue for the run.</p>

<p>The upgrade was really from Brogdon to Jrue, for the playoffs anyway. People have a misconception that Smart wasn&rsquo;t willing to sacrifice anything because he had legitimately become the 3rd best player on the team, but Smart consistently did whatever was asked of him to help the team overachieve for years. Honestly, Brogdon was the one who seemed to be the most selfish. There&rsquo;s a reason Brad was so quick to ship him and Grant off and that Tatum didn&rsquo;t mention those guys.</p>

<p>Proper team building is what has seen the Celtics reach this point. That&rsquo;s how you create a potential dynasty. Smart trades, good drafting, strong player development.</p>

      <label for="lf0lp0t" class="commentText"><p>Basically the team is not owned by one person (cause that would be hella expensive) so it&rsquo;s a group of guys that all own a certain percentage and together they form the majority ownership of the team. Some of those guys have decided they want to sell now. What I mean with it will likely be a similar ownership group is that the whole group will probably not be replaced but rather a new group will be formed with some of the current owners and some new owners. At least that&rsquo;s my understanding maybe someone more knowledgeable can correct/expand on this</p>

Taking touches away from him was the best thing they ever did. Hes a role player who was in too big a role.</p>

<p>Boston fans worshipped him before he left despite the fact he was obviously holding them back. The ultimate indictment on their ability to evaluate talent</p>

<p>Steven‚Äôs jettisoning him for KP and two first rounders is absolute highway robbery. I‚Äôll never get over it. KP is 20/7/2 on elite efficiency and more impactful defense</p>
