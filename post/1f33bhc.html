      <p>I‚Äôm curious to hear when‚Äôs the last time if ever have you gone back and watched an old game and what game was it?</p>

<p>When talking to people in real life I haven‚Äôt really met anyone who has taken the time to go back and watch old games. I‚Äôm curious to hear if this is the normal standard which I assume it is or if there are a large number of enthusiasts who do watch old games here.</p>

<p>Personally I like to go back and watch some of the old finals games.</p>

<p>Knicks should&rsquo;ve won that shit! I do not know how the Rockets came away with that win haha, crazy how much shit Starks gets for Game 7 when it was really Ewing who fumbled the series in Game 6 AND 7. He was atrocious.</p>

      <label for="lkbminb" class="commentText"><p>Ehh by the ‚Äò90s, if you had cable, it felt like you had pretty solid access to a lot of games. In Detroit, we had most Pistons games televised on either PASS or one of the local channels. Then there was the TBS and WGN Super Stations that hit us with Hawks and Bulls games. <em>Then</em> there were nationally televised games on TBS, TNT, and NBC.</p>

<p>The biggest difference was the lack of League Pass (or at least the form of League Pass that felt accessible) as well as the inability to watch games that‚Äôd already happened (unless you recorded the game on VHS, as I sometimes did). Otherwise, hours of games were generally available for people on many nights.</p>

<p>We watched and followed our local hometown teams passionately and we watched the full games and taped them on VCR&rsquo;s when we couldn&rsquo;t watch them live for whatever reason.</p>

<p>We also watched many of the national broadcast games in full too if it was a team or player(s) that you liked or wanted to see; which was also free over the air.</p>

<p>I lived a few states away but got WGN so I was able to watch every bulls game in the Jordan era- which we did because there simply wasn&rsquo;t anything else on at the time besides baseball and rented VHS/Beta movies.</p>

      <label for="lkc07e0" class="commentText"><p>You had to watch the games, if you didn&rsquo;t catch a game, you missed it.  You could record it with the VCR, but that meant permission from the parents or whatever the household rules around the VCR were, because the VCR was on the main TV.  You could wait for the news, sports comes on around 9:20 WGN and 10:20 the national channels in Chicagoland, and you might get three clips.  ESPN might show clips, if your team is good, or a popular team, or from Boston.  There were weekly highlights shows on the weekends, showing the best dunks and plays.</p>

<p>You could of course read about it the next day in the paper, or maybe read about it in a magazine next week in Sports Illustrated or Slam.  But there weren&rsquo;t like highlights that you could just pull up.  So we watched it.  And kept track of the score in our heads lol because there was no score at the bottom until the 90s some time.  Also we had the ability to pay attention to something for more than 5 minutes.  Which, man, I have gotten so much worse about this myself, so I don&rsquo;t blame anyone who can&rsquo;t remember before the internet.  But this shit is bad for us.</p>

      <label for="lkbf72p" class="commentText"><p>The closest thing I‚Äôve done to that was watching a Youtube condensed Milwaukee Bucks game from early 1989.  I remember the Bucks had low expectations that year but actually overachieved which was why I had some interest.</p>

<p>I remember only one silly thing from watching that broadcast.  There was a Whitney Houston song blaring through the speakers of the Bucks arena during a timeout.  I never would have thought a Whitney Houston song would get played at an NBA game and actually sound good, but to be honest, it sounded so freaking cool getting played full blast during the timeout.</p>

<p>It was one of her few uptempo hits ‚ÄúSo Emotional‚Äù that was getting blasted through the speakers.  That was sort of an awesome time period for me personally and the Bucks were a solid team at that time which made watching the game a nice piece of cultural nostalgia for me.  I miss everyone I knew from that time period, miss 1980s NBA which was a fantastic era, and I miss Whitney Houston, one of the greatest singers ever that lived a very short life thanks to a pretty bad drug addiction issue.</p>

      <label for="lkbntcb" class="commentText"><p>I just watched the highest scoring game in NBA history on Monday (Pistons over the Nuggets 186-184 in 1983). Really enjoyed it, though I‚Äôm someone quite familiar with most of the players participating (except Kenny Dennard) so I think that contributes to the experience.</p>

<p>The week prior, I watched Game 6 of the 2003 Finals (Spurs-Nets; the Tim Duncan near quadruple double). I know that‚Äôs not ‚Äò90s and ‚Äò80s but I figured close enough for the sake of discussion.</p>

<p>Then before that, I watched Game 6 of the Bulls-Knicks series in ‚Äò94. It was the Pippen dunk on Ewing game, during Jordan‚Äôs retirement. The last game at Chicago Stadium now that I think of it. Amazing energy, lot of intensity.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think the hang-up for a lot of people when it comes to watching old footage is probably a lack of context and general knowledge of all the characters involved. Not just the Jordans and Duncans, but Starks, Oakley, VanDeWeghe, Tripucka, Pete Myers, and more. Seems to add more meaning to the experience, and that‚Äôs tough to have unless you‚Äôre invested in the game‚Äôs history.</p>

      <label for="lkbuxyg" class="commentText"><p>I rewatched 99 Kings Jazz game 5 a few months ago. Probably seen that game like five times by now, such a classic.</p>

<p>I generally don‚Äôt watch much prior to ~1993ish. Can‚Äôt remember the last time I watched a full game from the 80s.</p>

      <label for="lkc41km" class="commentText"><p>There was a Pistons Lakers finals game (1988) that was on NBA or ESPN recently. Featured them talking about how hurt Isaiah Thomas was and Barbara Streisand. Was kinda fun to watch half of it before going out.</p>
