<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think there is a team in the league with as much talent and as much accomplishment that it just felt like they weren’t going to get too excited or too upset over the downs of a season, but there was a lot of ‘mercenary feelings’.</p>

<p>I was with the team on the Grammy trip, and they were outstanding. They emptied the tank on that trip: they won 6 out of 7 on an incredibly difficult trip as far as logistics are concerned. And the trade deadline is Thursday after they get home from that. No one got traded, but there were guys who were asking to get traded from a team that came home from the trip with the best record in the Western Conference, and that felt weird.</p>

<p>It felt very strange to me that you got this team that could do something very special, has a bunch of guys who have not
 accomplished what Kawhi has as far as being a champion, and then you got third stringers that were like “Yeah, we don’t want to be here,” and were making it so public that the game before the All-Star break they had to send guys home to get their minds right.</p>

<p>The other was a guy who had been benched with zero playing time for months after being a starter for the past decade.</p>

<p>And maybe the uniqueness just comes from us hearing about it and maybe there are more teams out there with multiple 3rd stringers asking out.</p>

      <label for="l9grq95" class="commentText"><p>For some of these younger 3rd stringers that are at the end of their &ldquo;prospect&rdquo; time, I totally get it. Say, for example, a 3rd string point guard got a chance to be the backup point guard for the Raptors last season. They could have played themselves into a 20-30 million dollar contract just by being an average point guard with some upside. A chance to be a part of a championship team is great, but the opportunity to play and make generational money would likely top that- especially in your mid-20s looking for that first big contract.</p>

      <label for="l9gsz5h" class="commentText"><p>I mean to a certain extent it’s understandable. Bones was basically a backup and sometimes starting with Russ there and then when harden came he basically ended up as bench warmer.</p>

      <label for="l9hbte5" class="commentText"><p>This seems like a nothing when you realize the players he’s referring to are Tucker and Bones. Bones owed 2.3, maybe the Clips cut him? They couldn’t trade him at the deadline. Tucker has an 11.5M player option for this year, Clips would probably have to give up some draft capital to get off that.</p>
