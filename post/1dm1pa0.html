</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It was a beautiful display of team basketball. Not a single player also had to average more than 35.2 minutes per game, which was averaged by Boris Diaw and Tony Parker.</p>

<p>It was also one of the more efficient scoring Finals for the winning team. The Spurs shot 53% from the field, 47% from 3 and 75% from the foul line. They only lost game 2 by  2 points and won their 4 games by an average point differential of 18.</p>

<p>This was also the last time a team won the Finals without a single player on the winning team averaging less than 20 points.</p>

      <label for="l9smbh3" class="commentText"><p>I think the biggest testament to Pop’s coaching is the fact that the Spurs won in 2003 by playing almost entirely iso ball and feeding Tim Duncan on literally every single possession for the entirety of the finals. Then by the time they won in 2014 they had shifted to playing almost entirely systematic unselfish team ball. He adapted to his roster and his players so well throughout their stretch of competitiveness.</p>

<p>It is wild that 3 decades in a row in the &lsquo;4 year of that decade a team that doesn&rsquo;t fit the traditional model (top 5 tier player with a good team around them) wins the title, but instead one built more around a complete team.</p>

<p>His first game of the finals was a 32/20/6/3/7. That&rsquo;s not quiet. He finished the series with an almost quadruple double (that some people still argue it was) 21/20/10/0/8.</p>

<p>In 2014 he was old, that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>

      <label for="l9snr2t" class="commentText"><p>That Spurs team was a buzzsaw.</p>

<p>I think people mischaracterize the 2014 Spurs as a team with a bunch of role players, but the fact of the matter is that that team was LOADED. They basically went 10 deep, even in the playoffs when rotations typically shrink to seven players, maybe eight.</p>

<p>Did they have one dominant scorer? No, but they had so many good players that they were able to evenly distribute the wealth. Plus they had shooters everywhere.</p>

<p>They would go on runs where they would just rip the heart out of their opponents. Just look what they did to Miami in the finals that year. They would end games within a span of three minutes, very similar to the Warriors.</p>

<p>Duncan tends to be very underrated from that year, too. He was still genuinely elite. He just had to coast more because he was older, but he was still one of the league&rsquo;s best defensive players and could absolutely dominate for stretches offensively when he needed to.</p>
