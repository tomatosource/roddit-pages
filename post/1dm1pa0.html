</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It was a beautiful display of team basketball. Not a single player also had to average more than 35.2 minutes per game, which was averaged by Boris Diaw and Tony Parker.</p>

<p>It was also one of the more efficient scoring Finals for the winning team. The Spurs shot 53% from the field, 47% from 3 and 75% from the foul line. They only lost game 2 by  2 points and won their 4 games by an average point differential of 18.</p>

<p>This was also the last time a team won the Finals without a single player on the winning team averaging less than 20 points.</p>

      <label for="l9smbh3" class="commentText"><p>I think the biggest testament to Pop’s coaching is the fact that the Spurs won in 2003 by playing almost entirely iso ball and feeding Tim Duncan on literally every single possession for the entirety of the finals. Then by the time they won in 2014 they had shifted to playing almost entirely systematic unselfish team ball. He adapted to his roster and his players so well throughout their stretch of competitiveness.</p>

      <label for="l9sq223" class="commentText"><p>Crazy part is, nothing&rsquo;s changed. Spurs ranked #2 in assists per game in the whole league this season. This philosophy translates to the modern spurs demonstrated in one of the last spurs games linked below. The problem is, we&rsquo;re in rebuild mode right now so we don&rsquo;t have many NBA caliber players on our team right now that can consistently knock down shots. But we are constantly still a high assist team. And when everyone&rsquo;s making their shots, it&rsquo;s still beautiful basketball. In the short term, it looks like incompetence by not letting Wemby touch the ball enough. But once the team gets reworked after maybe 1 more year, this is likely the kind of stat sheet that the organization still wants.</p>

      <label for="l9srnwu" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, although I would like to see more of a focus on wemby, i think the system will be able to let him focus more defensively which is where he really shines, while the high passing and movement will still find him for the easy buckets only he can score without him having to shoulder a high offensive load. And the thing that really stands out is even with the whole “wemby cant get the ball cause his teammates cant find him narrative” he still had a crazy high usage rate for a rookie, meaning he was still finishing most plays. Very exciting stuff if we can get players who can run Pops offensive more efficiently, thats what i really liked from Mamu to end the season</p>

      <label for="l9swhqw" class="commentText"><p>I think that&rsquo;s the FO&rsquo;s plan. It makes more sense to build depth first from the 2024 and 2025 draft before we go all in on an all-star trade/signing. I think after the 2025 draft during the 2025 off-season is when actual win-now moves will start to be made. Likely this off-season the front office is probably just drafting our 2 lottery picks and signing 1 or 2 minor roleplayers (who admittedly would still be an upgrade from some of our G-Leaguers).</p>

<p>This was B2B same finals matchup where Heat beat Spurs in the previous year. For people not familiar with this era, Heat were far superior in terms of talent. But Spurs were actually a better team. Not only they got their revenge in 2014, they were winning the 2013 finals for the most part too. It was a prime showcase of &ldquo;team chemistry over talent&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that &ldquo;Heat were the far better team on paper&rdquo; is a severe oversimplification of what their players actually were by 2014</p>

<p>People might have been surprised it was THAT lopsided but few were surprised the Spurs won</p>

People thought it was gonna be a repeat of 2012 once Ibaka came back, and the Spurs just turned on the jets in game 5. Boris Diaw with like 28 points in game 6 that went to OT.</p>

<p>Same thing in the finals, game 1 was extremely close up until LeBron got cramps and the Heat took game 2. People expected a close series going back to Miami and the Spurs just took off. I remember LeBron exploding on several first quarters just to keep up with the Spurs but he just couldn’t keep it up for the entire game.</p>

      <label for="l9snr2t" class="commentText"><p>That Spurs team was a buzzsaw.</p>

<p>I think people mischaracterize the 2014 Spurs as a team with a bunch of role players, but the fact of the matter is that that team was LOADED. They basically went 10 deep, even in the playoffs when rotations typically shrink to seven players, maybe eight.</p>

<p>Did they have one dominant scorer? No, but they had so many good players that they were able to evenly distribute the wealth. Plus they had shooters everywhere.</p>

<p>They would go on runs where they would just rip the heart out of their opponents. Just look what they did to Miami in the finals that year. They would end games within a span of three minutes, very similar to the Warriors.</p>

<p>Duncan tends to be very underrated from that year, too. He was still genuinely elite. He just had to coast more because he was older, but he was still one of the league&rsquo;s best defensive players and could absolutely dominate for stretches offensively when he needed to.</p>

<p>Elite rim protection, versatile defenders, a bunch of playmakers and shooters everywhere. Duncan was also much closer to a top-5 player that year than people think. He couldn&rsquo;t do it for a full 82-game season, but he absolutely could dominate for stretches and we definitely saw it in the playoffs that year where he would just take over games on both ends of the floor. Miami had no answer for him in the finals.</p>

<p>They really were like a hybrid team. They had some leftover elements from the 2000s but also clear components that would work just fine in 2024.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were the perfect hybrid and had much more of an effect on today&rsquo;s game than the media would like to admit.</p>

      <label for="l9sprru" class="commentText"><p>I would agree with a lot of this. And yeah Duncan could go on spurts of elite play but not consistently because he was old (hence the memes of giving him rest days where it literally had (old) in the injury report). Sort of like LeBron now where he can have moments that remind you how fucking good he was but he isn&rsquo;t doing it for every game of a playoff run anymore. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was a consistent top 5 tier player on that run.</p>

<p>The modern offensive flow in particular I agree with, that team moved the ball in a way that was breathtaking at the time and even now can be inspiring to watch. Selfless ball is my favorite type.</p>

      <label for="l9stnt8" class="commentText"><p>Was the Celtics&rsquo; defense this year not crazy despite today&rsquo;s spacing? They won all 4 Finals games by holding their opponent under 100 points (89, 98, 99, 88) and barely breaking 100 themselves (107, 105, 106, 106).</p>

<p>Cs are honestly both a suffocating defense like the &lsquo;04 Pistons and (when humming) an unselfish opportunistic offense like the &lsquo;14 Spurs. Their defense is way more reliable, though. It&rsquo;s unfortunate they couldn&rsquo;t showcase the offense as well for the fans this Finals.</p>

<p>In 2014 he was old, that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>

<p>From 99-07 he won 4 titles and 3 Finals MVPs while averaging 24 and 13 in the postseason.</p>

<p>His Finals averages in those Finals:</p>

<p>1999: <sup>27</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .537 FG%</p>

<p>2003: <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> on .495 FG%</p>

<p>2005: <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .419 FG%</p>

<p>2007: <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> on .446 FG%</p>

<p>So he’d already had two dominant Finals MVP series before putting up less staggering numbers in later Finals, so his reputation of being able to be the #1 on championship teams had already been established, as by the end of 2003, he had 2 MVPs and 2 Finals MVPs.</p>

      <label for="l9spp9n" class="commentText"><p>You really think Duncan gets cooked for either of his first 2 Finals?</p>

<p>From 99-03, his overall playoff averages were <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .504 eFG%.</p>

<p>He had 2 MVPs by then too, averaging <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> on .503 eFG% in the regular season from 99-03.</p>

<p>Anything after that point was gravy for his reputation, as he’d already established he was an elite player (2 MVPs and 6 total Top-5 seasons) along with 2 Finals MVPs with some great playoff runs.</p>

<p>Him not needing to put up crazy numbers in Finals 3-5 is quite different than doing it for your only ring(s).</p>

      <label for="l9srt1y" class="commentText"><p>Yes lol Lebron was getting cooked by the media even after he posted 28/10/7 in 2012 finals after losing two finals appearances. The media criticism went crazy around those first Lebron years. Duncan would always be in “tier 2” by today’s criticisms behind Shaq and Kobe. It would be the “well Duncan is part of a great team” “easy path with Drob” “collective win with manu and Parker and then kawhi”. All I’m saying is they’d make a different narrative for maybe the most famously quiet superstar of all time</p>

<p>Edit: and all of this was by the end of 2003. When Shaq and Kobe were on the same team. There’s no valid criticism that Duncan was just on a great team when the players you said would be viewed as being ahead of him were on the same team.</p>
