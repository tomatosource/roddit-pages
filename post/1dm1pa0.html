</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It was a beautiful display of team basketball. Not a single player also had to average more than 35.2 minutes per game, which was averaged by Boris Diaw and Tony Parker.</p>

<p>It was also one of the more efficient scoring Finals for the winning team. The Spurs shot 53% from the field, 47% from 3 and 75% from the foul line. They only lost game 2 by  2 points and won their 4 games by an average point differential of 18.</p>

<p>This was also the last time a team won the Finals without a single player on the winning team averaging less than 20 points.</p>

      <label for="l9smbh3" class="commentText"><p>I think the biggest testament to Pop’s coaching is the fact that the Spurs won in 2003 by playing almost entirely iso ball and feeding Tim Duncan on literally every single possession for the entirety of the finals. Then by the time they won in 2014 they had shifted to playing almost entirely systematic unselfish team ball. He adapted to his roster and his players so well throughout their stretch of competitiveness.</p>

      <label for="l9sq223" class="commentText"><p>Crazy part is, nothing&rsquo;s changed. Spurs ranked #2 in assists per game in the whole league this season. This philosophy translates to the modern spurs demonstrated in one of the last spurs games linked below. The problem is, we&rsquo;re in rebuild mode right now so we don&rsquo;t have many NBA caliber players on our team right now that can consistently knock down shots. But we are constantly still a high assist team. And when everyone&rsquo;s making their shots, it&rsquo;s still beautiful basketball. In the short term, it looks like incompetence by not letting Wemby touch the ball enough. But once the team gets reworked after maybe 1 more year, this is likely the kind of stat sheet that the organization still wants.</p>

      <label for="l9srnwu" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, although I would like to see more of a focus on wemby, i think the system will be able to let him focus more defensively which is where he really shines, while the high passing and movement will still find him for the easy buckets only he can score without him having to shoulder a high offensive load. And the thing that really stands out is even with the whole “wemby cant get the ball cause his teammates cant find him narrative” he still had a crazy high usage rate for a rookie, meaning he was still finishing most plays. Very exciting stuff if we can get players who can run Pops offensive more efficiently, thats what i really liked from Mamu to end the season</p>

      <label for="l9u89gc" class="commentText"><p>The interesting thing is, how will Pop value Wemby’s offense vs defence long term?</p>

<p>I think he’s about to dominate the DPOY awards, unless the Spurs value his scoring &amp; passing enough to game plan that way (e.g. Wemby is not around the paint for blocks &amp; rebounds as much, so he can lead the fast break more often).</p>

      <label for="l9ucea5" class="commentText"><p>Depends on the personnel we end up drafting and how much we need either or from him, as it stands now defensively for sure (although wemby honestly has the greenlight to do whatever he wants), we bleed points with Zach, Malaki, Cedi, etc but if the Spurs keep drafting lengthy guys with size like they have been, there might be a transition to an offense focused wemby</p>

      <label for="l9ud71d" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>My instinct is that defence is the focus, as it makes the game almost suffocating for the opponent. Once Wemby gets more reads, learns more player tendencies &amp; plays a few more minutes a game, the other team has to shoot lights out from 3, get him in foul trouble or they’re toast.</p>

<p>Someone posted Manute Bol getting 4 blocks in under 10 seconds recently, that’s back on the menu with Wemby &amp; it’s going to kick ass.</p>

      <label for="l9swhqw" class="commentText"><p>I think that&rsquo;s the FO&rsquo;s plan. It makes more sense to build depth first from the 2024 and 2025 draft before we go all in on an all-star trade/signing. I think after the 2025 draft during the 2025 off-season is when actual win-now moves will start to be made. Likely this off-season the front office is probably just drafting our 2 lottery picks and signing 1 or 2 minor roleplayers (who admittedly would still be an upgrade from some of our G-Leaguers).</p>

Im not saying I expect them to get to the second round, but even just one round in the playoffs maybe with a play in game or two, would help the org speed things up in terms of setting the right team around Wemby.</p>

      <label for="l9vt4vd" class="commentText"><p>A big part of the reason why the team has been leading the league in assist these past few years is because they don&rsquo;t have a true shot creator. The only way we can score is by passing. Look at the post Kawai/Demar years. We we&rsquo;re constantly middle of the league in assist with them, after they left we shot up in assist per game.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I say the teams biggest weakness is shot creation.</p>

      <label for="l9twj38" class="commentText"><p>I think it was less of Pop adapting to his players and more just the gradual evolution to heavy-spacing modern basketball that he, his staff, and his players pioneered. Whether or not Wemby was on the floor, we saw many glimpses of the Beautiful Game even in our bad losses this year. Biggest differences being that our roster is an average of 8 years younger and can&rsquo;t shoot. I expect many great seasons with this Spurs era and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be sharing the ball more than our opponents in our playoff runs, though probably not an entire 157 more passes per game like in 2014.</p>

      <label for="l9vv9vx" class="commentText"><p>Yes! This. I got the sense as well Duncan was disappointed in himself.  He seemed more sluggish this series, more banged up, etc.  Next year, he looked like he dropped 10 lbs or so, way way more nimble and just a plain chip on his shoulder.</p>

      <label for="l9u3u38" class="commentText"><p>This is slightly ironic given he played for the same coach and hall of famer cast for nearly 20 years.</p>

<p>And the fact that he simply minimized his role and played 30 MPG towards the final third of his career.</p>

<p>Do we credit him with versatility? Credit the system the coach created? Credit the continuity of talent? Credit the supporting cast that allowed him to take rest games, minutes / load management?</p>

Kobe&rsquo;s last year Lakers had the worst record in franchise history.

      <label for="l9szth7" class="commentText"><p>I think some people forget the Spurs won 67 and 61 games with Kawhi and LeMarcus Aldridge kind of taking turns but with lots of flow. And still won 48 and 47 games with DeRozan and Aldridge def taking turns playing midrange iso maestro.</p>

<p>IMO Pop adapts to his roster, not just their talents but also their personalities. A lot of people forget the Beautiful Game was driven from the bench with Manu, Boris Diaw, and Patty Mills. But with Kawhi/DeRozan and LMA the team needed them to finish possessions by doing their thing.</p>

Might be a simple clock with no real chance for reversal by then (assuming we don&rsquo;t invent our way out of it like we did with the Ozone layer), but it&rsquo;d still take about 100 years for us to be obliterated even in some of the worst scenarios. I don&rsquo;t think Global Nuclear war is particularly likely, but I cannot think of anything else that would do that in the next ten years other than a surprise astroid or a surprise yellowstone that happened to be big enough to kill everyone that quickly. So basically the under is saying you think it&rsquo;s more likely that nuclear war happens.</p>

      <label for="l9snr2t" class="commentText"><p>That Spurs team was a buzzsaw.</p>

<p>I think people mischaracterize the 2014 Spurs as a team with a bunch of role players, but the fact of the matter is that that team was LOADED. They basically went 10 deep, even in the playoffs when rotations typically shrink to seven players, maybe eight.</p>

<p>Did they have one dominant scorer? No, but they had so many good players that they were able to evenly distribute the wealth. Plus they had shooters everywhere.</p>

<p>They would go on runs where they would just rip the heart out of their opponents. Just look what they did to Miami in the finals that year. They would end games within a span of three minutes, very similar to the Warriors.</p>

<p>Duncan tends to be very underrated from that year, too. He was still genuinely elite. He just had to coast more because he was older, but he was still one of the league&rsquo;s best defensive players and could absolutely dominate for stretches offensively when he needed to.</p>

      <label for="l9sz1w2" class="commentText"><p>OG Anunoby is about to get a max contract and Knicks fans will swear by his impact when you look at how they play with and without him.</p>

<p>The Spurs had two of those guys with Kawhi and Danny.</p>

<p>We also had a good playoff scorer and playmaker in Parker. An elite rim protector in Duncan. The best 6th man in the NBA in Manu. I haven’t even gotten to Boris Diaw or Tiago Splitter.</p>

<p>Teams like the 2014 Spurs or 2004 Pistons people get too romantic with. They talk about them like they’re protagonists in a sports movie about teamwork overcoming talent and the players being more than the sum of their parts.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were stacked with talent. They would have been an all time great regular season team if they didn’t have so many guys miss a game here or there due to an injury or rest.</p>

<p>I remember watching them that year and thinking, &ldquo;Yeah, no one is beating this team in a seven-game series.&rdquo; The fact that so many people had OKC or Miami beating them just goes to show that many people didn&rsquo;t really watch the Spurs that year.

<p>Lebron and the Heat, they were formidable but solvable. Their frontline defense wasn’t great and the whole team is focused on rebounding and kickouts from Lebron and Wade.</p>

<p>The Thunder didn’t have weaknesses other than Russell Westbrook especially if you could bait him into playing like an idiot. Even so Durant could go off and it didn’t matter.</p>

      <label for="l9ugy5w" class="commentText"><p>Yeah they were really talented, but they didn&rsquo;t have elite superstar talent. Nobody was a top 10-15 guy in the league based solely on the 2014 season (though Parker made all NBA mostly as a team concession &ldquo;#1 seed can&rsquo;t have zero all NBA players&rdquo; deal). And they were all getting older. It IS a big testament to what can happen if nobody gives a shit about their own fame or stats.</p>

<p>Nobody on the Pistons was top 10-15 league wide in 2004 either for that matter, but all 5 starters were probably in the top 40. They both did have a &ldquo;better worst starter&rdquo; than just about anyone else.</p>

So while they crushed the heat that year, if you put the 2014 spurs up against the 2013 heat my guess is it&rsquo;s still a 6-7 game series but maybe the spurs win.</p>

<p>This was B2B same finals matchup where Heat beat Spurs in the previous year. For people not familiar with this era, Heat were far superior in terms of talent. But Spurs were actually a better team. Not only they got their revenge in 2014, they were winning the 2013 finals for the most part too. It was a prime showcase of &ldquo;team chemistry over talent&rdquo;.</p>

LeBron&rsquo;s teams were looking very good on the way to the Finals due to the lack of any serious competition in the East. I think this helps explain why people were surprised that each Finals ended up being so lop-sided. Even in 2017 against the KD Warriors, I remember a lot of chatter about the Cavs having a historically good offense, possibly making for an interesting series.</p>

<p>Same thing in the finals, game 1 was extremely close up until LeBron got cramps and the Heat took game 2. People expected a close series going back to Miami and the Spurs just took off.

This dunk was a bench guy going fearlessly at a guy that had been dominating the Spurs defensively.  The Spurs steamrolled game 5, took game 6, and then ran through Miami.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not really. The 2013 Finals was a series where every possession mattered because the teams were perfectly matched. That series was as close as I&rsquo;ve ever seen to truly balanced matchup, and I think it&rsquo;s the greatest NBA Finals of all time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a prime showcase of &ldquo;team chemistry over talent&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were one of the most talented teams in NBA history. Four Hall of Fame players and a HoF coach, 62-20 record in the regular season. That they played team ball together was excellent, but they didn&rsquo;t win because they were role players who played well together, they won because they were loaded to the top with talent.</p>

<p>Also, implying that an Erik Spoelstra-coached team somehow relies on raw talent over proper team concepts is&hellip; a take. It&rsquo;s wrong, but it&rsquo;s a take.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heat were far superior in terms of talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they were not, as explained above. Even if they were, the Heat had spent the past four seasons playing into June, and they were physically and mentally exhausted. The 2014 Spurs beat them because they had more talent on the court and were not as tired and broken down as the 2014 Heat.</p>

      <label for="l9uf32u" class="commentText"><p>10 deep is really underrated honestly. Thats 3 extra players at minimum compared to nearly every team that you can trust to play and play well. Also Wade was not the same player at that point. He had 4 less points and half the assists. His knees had really lost it at this point. He couldn&rsquo;t put the same level of offensive pressure on a defense. Honestly it surprises me how few people seem to remember the beauty of the pick and roll that Miami did was. Bosh was an elite screen and roll player for them. I guess I remember cause Bosh was and is my favorite player ever.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Bosh was elite, and the only reason he isn&rsquo;t acknowledged more is because of ESPN&rsquo;s stupid &ldquo;who&rsquo;s Batman, who&rsquo;s Robin?&rdquo; narrative. The Heatles were the Justice League, especially that 2013 roster.</p>

<p>Spolestra also really pushed the 3 point efficiency concept that the Warriors ran with. If Bosh wasn&rsquo;t available for an easy layup or close 2 point shot, he was at least drawing an additional defender that allowed one of the role players like Ray Allen (RAY F&rsquo;ING ALLEN!) or Mike Miller (Mike Miller!) to hit the 3.</p>

<p>If Bosh hadn&rsquo;t developed blood clots we&rsquo;d be talking about his playoff wars against the Cavs in multiple mid-2010s ECFs.</p>

      <label for="l9ufm6p" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s absolutely not how it&rsquo;s perceived that day. Parker is the only all-nba type of player, and even then there are still many players that people choose over him. Even at PG position people generally rate CP3 much higher than him despite the ring differences and team records. And he&rsquo;s simply not on the level of the Lebrons and the Durants or even Paul Georges. Parker is stilled skillful and speedy but he&rsquo;s no where near his prime&rsquo;s speed. Plus injuries as well I think since during the OKC series?</p>

<p>Duncan is a super old guy who can protect the rim very well but mediocre on offense.</p>

<p>Manu is very unpredictable, and as he aged he is much less reliable (as in 2013).</p>

<p>Danny green is someone who get bounced around the league and finally become a excellent 3&amp;D - who can barely dribble.</p>

<p>Kawhi is just a young guy who is like a 3&amp;D plus</p>

<p>Tiago is just a pretty good center, but never get to star-level.</p>

<p>Boris Diaw is cut by the Bobcats. He&rsquo;s skillful but pretty unmotivated and undisiciplined.</p>

<p>Patty Mills barely crack in the rotation even in 2013, who is just a super undersized guard who can shoot.</p>

<p>Marco Belinelli is a crafty movement shooter who can barely defend</p>

<p>Cory Joseph is a undersized defensive guard who can&rsquo;t slash fast and can&rsquo;t shoot.</p>

<p>Matt Boner is&hellip;.a personality, who is a slow big that can shoot 3s but can barely defend.</p>

<p>TLDR:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This team&rsquo;s 4HOF is either way past their prime (with the exception of Parker, where his prime starts to fade) or still very early in the league (Kawhi). Check out the all-star vote or all-nba selection back then.</p></li>

<li><p>Their role players are not super talented. More like they have some unique skillsets that can complement each other if they can play together well. And that&rsquo;s what the Spurs did.</p></li>

<li><p>No this team is not &lsquo;super-talented&rsquo; Without a good system a good coach and an established culture, that team could barely make the playoff.</p></li>

      <label for="l9uvxlx" class="commentText"><p>I’m giving them the respect due their accomplishments that season. 2013-14 was the last gasp of that decade long Spurs core. Just like how Dwyane Wade had more gas in the tank than given credit even if he didn’t play like his Flash days any longer, so did the Spurs core players. Acting like the 2014 Spurs were washed up is silly. Any team that wins 62 games and wins the Finals in 5 is a great team period.
People are way too eager to minimize that Spurs team, probably because it helps them claim the Heatles were overrated (they weren’t; the 2013 Heat is one of the greatest single season teams ever, and making the Finals 4 years in a row is historic and incredibly difficult.)</p>

      <label for="l9t2n4p" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think so. Analysis by many statisticians showed that the heat were best playing LeBron-ball + shooters surrounding him, hence their dominance in 2012 and 2013 when wade began to take a step back. I don’t think a better 2014 wade makes them win that championship over that legendary spurs team. They would have a much better chance if they traded wade for, hypothetically, kyrie Irving, or another guard that can create but also space the floor off the ball</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is this true though? Idk that the heat had far superior talents. Wade was a shell of himself at this point, Duncan was better or as good as Bosh, and Parker was better than chalmers. For brevity sakes, let’s call splitter, manu, haslem, and Allen a wash. I think it’s fair to say people probably overlooked how much wade/bosh had regressed, how much weaker the east was than the west which allowed Lebron to paper over a lot of the cracks, and how ridiculously deep that spurs team were. I strongly disagree that Miami were far superior in terms of talent. What would be far more interesting and where that statement might be more accurate would be say, 2012 or 2013 Miami vs that 2014 spurs team.</p>

<p>Elite rim protection, versatile defenders, a bunch of playmakers and shooters everywhere. Duncan was also much closer to a top-5 player that year than people think. He couldn&rsquo;t do it for a full 82-game season, but he absolutely could dominate for stretches and we definitely saw it in the playoffs that year where he would just take over games on both ends of the floor. Miami had no answer for him in the finals.</p>

<p>They really were like a hybrid team. They had some leftover elements from the 2000s but also clear components that would work just fine in 2024.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were the perfect hybrid and had much more of an effect on today&rsquo;s game than the media would like to admit.</p>

      <label for="l9sprru" class="commentText"><p>I would agree with a lot of this. And yeah Duncan could go on spurts of elite play but not consistently because he was old (hence the memes of giving him rest days where it literally had (old) in the injury report). Sort of like LeBron now where he can have moments that remind you how fucking good he was but he isn&rsquo;t doing it for every game of a playoff run anymore. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was a consistent top 5 tier player on that run.</p>

<p>The modern offensive flow in particular I agree with, that team moved the ball in a way that was breathtaking at the time and even now can be inspiring to watch. Selfless ball is my favorite type.</p>

Then you had Kawhi, Splitter, and Green who were perfect at their roles defending and playing without the ball. The warriors and Celtics are the only teams who have been able to replicate that. Most modern teams are like the nuggets or lakers or Mavs where the star players are the hubs who generate 90% of the offense.</p>

      <label for="l9stnt8" class="commentText"><p>Was the Celtics&rsquo; defense this year not crazy despite today&rsquo;s spacing? They won all 4 Finals games by holding their opponent under 100 points (89, 98, 99, 88) and barely breaking 100 themselves (107, 105, 106, 106).</p>

<p>Cs are honestly both a suffocating defense like the &lsquo;04 Pistons and (when humming) an unselfish opportunistic offense like the &lsquo;14 Spurs. Their defense is way more reliable, though. It&rsquo;s unfortunate they couldn&rsquo;t showcase the offense as well for the fans this Finals.</p>

It is fundementally not possible to be as much of a defensive juggernaut as the Pistons were both because of spacing and even more so the rules and officiating favors the offense more now than it did then.</p>

<p>That is not a knock on the Celtics. They are a more talented team than the Pistons were. But you do not get to play defense at the level they did in this era, even beyond the differences in spacing.</p>

<p>2024 Celtics also wouldn&rsquo;t qualify due to minutes played, right? 19 games * 48min+ 1 OT *5min = 917 minutes.</p>

<p>Also, it might be clearer to just use the percentage (e.g. +11.6% instead of 111.6) since DRtg is usually better the lower it is.</p>

<p>No, they wouldn&rsquo;t qualify. I just chose 1000 MP for simplicity sake. If I dropped it to 900 MP and ignored teams from the stretches I already listed you&rsquo;d get down to the 2024 Celtics without much tangible difference in their historical standing whether you look at 900 vs 1000.</p>

<p>I see your point about DefRtg being a stat that&rsquo;s better the lower the number is. In baseball a lower ERA is better but ERA+ is still a number that tracks positive going higher above 100. I figured it best to follow that established convention of the adjusted stats even when it may feel unintuitive.</p>

      <label for="l9v4qds" class="commentText"><p>Eh he&rsquo;s not arguably in the top echelon of players, and this playoff run to your point did not help his case. Look at Steph in 2022 and Jokic last year, Giannis in 2021 and both AD and Lebron in 2020 (for the playoff run specifically). I don&rsquo;t know if anyone believed Tatum had an argument for FMVP and this wasn&rsquo;t like the weird Iggy award for the first GSW title.</p>

      <label for="l9vef00" class="commentText"><p>Media hype is part of it but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that crazy to say he&rsquo;s at least an &ldquo;almost top 5&rdquo; player. He made first team this year for whatever that&rsquo;s worth, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that crazy considering he avged 27/8/5 on good efficiency while also being a good defender.</p>

<p>But he&rsquo;s definitely still a tier away from being a Giannis, Jokic, etc. type of next level guy, which is why I still sort of agree this Cs team is kind of different.</p>

<p>And yea it&rsquo;s 100% true he didn&rsquo;t really deserve the FMVP but I don&rsquo;t think a single series is enough to say he&rsquo;s not the best guy on his team. His scoring was off for sure but it&rsquo;s not like he played terrible, he played great defense and did everything else well.</p>

      <label for="l9xis2b" class="commentText"><p>Yea maybe. 2013 had much better versions of wade, bosh, and Allen. Decent role players like battier, miller, haslem, Lewis, Cole. Much better defense, better shooting, went 66-16 including a 27 win streak.</p>

<p>2014 spurs might still win, but it definitely wouldn’t be the evisceration it was against that 2014 Heat team.</p>

<p>Duncan obviously didn&rsquo;t do as well in 2014, but was one year removed from a 1st team all NBA spot. So though he might not have been a top 10 player during the season, (I am biased but) theres not ten guys I would&rsquo;ve chosen in the playoffs over him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say their big 3 and Kawhi were all somewhere in the 15 to 25 range. They didn&rsquo;t have high end talent in their primes, but they had a lot of good players, so their 3rd through 8th best guys were the equivalent of most teams 3rd through 5th.</p>

      <label for="l9t8hv3" class="commentText"><p>There level of 3 and d was just nuts. Kawhi is probably the best ever at being both an elite defender and elite 3 point shooter. No other DPOY level player comes even close to being a 40% 3 point shooter. Then you have Danny Green who would probably be considered the best ever typical role player 3 and d guy. Not a super star but can play all-nba level defense while always being a consistent 3 point shooter. And he may not be considered elite but Patty Mills got himself a 15 year career being a very consistent 3 and d level guy. And then add in Manu Ginobli who was always a good 3 point shooter but started to become a really pesty defender at this stage in his career as well.</p>

<p>It was what set him apart the most from Tony.  From his rookie season onwards Manu was an elite defensive player.  It is hard to get much defensive recognition when you play with Duncan and Bowen though.  Because, for the first 10 years of his career, he was only the 2nd best perimeter defender on the team, he didn&rsquo;t get much media attention but he was elite.</p>

      <label for="l9tu93q" class="commentText"><p>That was one of the best series in terms of the beauty of the fundamental game. That ball was moving so much on offense the Heat defenders heads were constantly on a swivel.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might have thought they didn&rsquo;t know the ball could touch the ground the way they were just passing it around.</p>

      <label for="l9utj07" class="commentText"><p>The talent of that team is super underrated. They had a big 4 in Duncan, Manu, Parker, and Kawhi. Prime Danny Green was probably their 5th best player.</p>

<p>For reference, an old Danny Green was the Lakers THIRD best player when they won in 2020</p>

<p>It really took some of the most lopsided teams to stop Lebron from winning 6 or 7 rings</p>

      <label for="l9v053p" class="commentText"><p>Steve Kerr openly admits he stole this offense from Popovich and the Spurs and used it to create his dynasty</p>

<p>Also the fact Popovich changed his whole teams identity from a defensive minded team to a passing and scoring team shooting 3s with ball movement is a testament to why he’s the goat, he saw the league was going in this direction and not only adjusted to it but innovated, there’s a reason all these other teams have always poached his assistants, unlike Phil who has no coaching tree legacy really</p>
