</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It was a beautiful display of team basketball. Not a single player also had to average more than 35.2 minutes per game, which was averaged by Boris Diaw and Tony Parker.</p>

<p>It was also one of the more efficient scoring Finals for the winning team. The Spurs shot 53% from the field, 47% from 3 and 75% from the foul line. They only lost game 2 by  2 points and won their 4 games by an average point differential of 18.</p>

<p>This was also the last time a team won the Finals without a single player on the winning team averaging less than 20 points.</p>

      <label for="l9smbh3" class="commentText"><p>I think the biggest testament to Pop’s coaching is the fact that the Spurs won in 2003 by playing almost entirely iso ball and feeding Tim Duncan on literally every single possession for the entirety of the finals. Then by the time they won in 2014 they had shifted to playing almost entirely systematic unselfish team ball. He adapted to his roster and his players so well throughout their stretch of competitiveness.</p>

      <label for="l9sq223" class="commentText"><p>Crazy part is, nothing&rsquo;s changed. Spurs ranked #2 in assists per game in the whole league this season. This philosophy translates to the modern spurs demonstrated in one of the last spurs games linked below. The problem is, we&rsquo;re in rebuild mode right now so we don&rsquo;t have many NBA caliber players on our team right now that can consistently knock down shots. But we are constantly still a high assist team. And when everyone&rsquo;s making their shots, it&rsquo;s still beautiful basketball. In the short term, it looks like incompetence by not letting Wemby touch the ball enough. But once the team gets reworked after maybe 1 more year, this is likely the kind of stat sheet that the organization still wants.</p>

      <label for="l9srnwu" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, although I would like to see more of a focus on wemby, i think the system will be able to let him focus more defensively which is where he really shines, while the high passing and movement will still find him for the easy buckets only he can score without him having to shoulder a high offensive load. And the thing that really stands out is even with the whole “wemby cant get the ball cause his teammates cant find him narrative” he still had a crazy high usage rate for a rookie, meaning he was still finishing most plays. Very exciting stuff if we can get players who can run Pops offensive more efficiently, thats what i really liked from Mamu to end the season</p>

      <label for="l9swhqw" class="commentText"><p>I think that&rsquo;s the FO&rsquo;s plan. It makes more sense to build depth first from the 2024 and 2025 draft before we go all in on an all-star trade/signing. I think after the 2025 draft during the 2025 off-season is when actual win-now moves will start to be made. Likely this off-season the front office is probably just drafting our 2 lottery picks and signing 1 or 2 minor roleplayers (who admittedly would still be an upgrade from some of our G-Leaguers).</p>

Im not saying I expect them to get to the second round, but even just one round in the playoffs maybe with a play in game or two, would help the org speed things up in terms of setting the right team around Wemby.</p>

      <label for="l9tcg2q" class="commentText"><p>depends. if wemby wants to be a star in the limelight he&rsquo;ll leave. if he is submissive he probably just stays. seeing how hes got a personality and seemingly a showman i can see him realizing his loss potential on spurs.</p>

<p>i dont think pop knows how to handle guys that arent like submissive all about the team type. guys like kawhi murray jackson all have spoken on this. and even tonys had his small controversies. players and pop arguing on the side lines werent a rare thing and for guys at this level its hard to supress your ego.</p>

<p>not saying this applies to wemby now but when hes the face of the league but not in every commerical and in all the tabloids. well everyone loves fame and money right. this is why tim and overseas players have worked well</p>

<p>if wemby was a laker then he would have been the most talked about athlete last year</p>

<p>IMO Pop adapts to his roster, not just their talents but also their personalities. A lot of people forget the Beautiful Game was driven from the bench with Manu, Boris Diaw, and Patty Mills. But with Kawhi/DeRozan and LMA the team needed them to finish possessions by doing their thing.</p>

      <label for="l9snr2t" class="commentText"><p>That Spurs team was a buzzsaw.</p>

<p>I think people mischaracterize the 2014 Spurs as a team with a bunch of role players, but the fact of the matter is that that team was LOADED. They basically went 10 deep, even in the playoffs when rotations typically shrink to seven players, maybe eight.</p>

<p>Did they have one dominant scorer? No, but they had so many good players that they were able to evenly distribute the wealth. Plus they had shooters everywhere.</p>

<p>They would go on runs where they would just rip the heart out of their opponents. Just look what they did to Miami in the finals that year. They would end games within a span of three minutes, very similar to the Warriors.</p>

<p>Duncan tends to be very underrated from that year, too. He was still genuinely elite. He just had to coast more because he was older, but he was still one of the league&rsquo;s best defensive players and could absolutely dominate for stretches offensively when he needed to.</p>

<p>The Spurs had two of those guys with Kawhi and Danny.</p>

<p>We also had a good playoff scorer and playmaker in Parker. An elite rim protector in Duncan. The best 6th man in the NBA in Manu. I haven’t even gotten to Boris Diaw or Tiago Splitter.</p>

<p>Teams like the 2014 Spurs or 2004 Pistons people get too romantic with. They talk about them like they’re protagonists in a sports movie about teamwork overcoming talent and the players being more than the sum of their parts.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were stacked with talent. They would have been an all time great regular season team if they didn’t have so many guys miss a game here or there due to an injury or rest.</p>

<p>This was B2B same finals matchup where Heat beat Spurs in the previous year. For people not familiar with this era, Heat were far superior in terms of talent. But Spurs were actually a better team. Not only they got their revenge in 2014, they were winning the 2013 finals for the most part too. It was a prime showcase of &ldquo;team chemistry over talent&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that &ldquo;Heat were the far better team on paper&rdquo; is a severe oversimplification of what their players actually were by 2014</p>

<p>People might have been surprised it was THAT lopsided but few were surprised the Spurs won</p>

LeBron&rsquo;s teams were looking very good on the way to the Finals due to the lack of any serious competition in the East. I think this helps explain why people were surprised that each Finals ended up being so lop-sided. Even in 2017 against the KD Warriors, I remember a lot of chatter about the Cavs having a historically good offense, possibly making for an interesting series.</p>

People thought it was gonna be a repeat of 2012 once Ibaka came back, and the Spurs just turned on the jets in game 5. Boris Diaw with like 28 points in game 6 that went to OT.</p>

<p>Same thing in the finals, game 1 was extremely close up until LeBron got cramps and the Heat took game 2. People expected a close series going back to Miami and the Spurs just took off. I remember LeBron exploding on several first quarters just to keep up with the Spurs but he just couldn’t keep it up for the entire game.</p>

It didn&rsquo;t seem like much at the time - especially down 18 in game 4, but Ibaka had owned the paint the entire series (~3.5 bpg).   This dunk was a bench guy going fearlessly at a guy that had been dominating the Spurs defensively.  The Spurs steamrolled game 5, took game 6, and then ran through Miami.</p>

<p>they were winning the 2013 finals for the most part too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. The 2013 Finals was a series where every possession mattered because the teams were perfectly matched. That series was as close as I&rsquo;ve ever seen to truly balanced matchup, and I think it&rsquo;s the greatest NBA Finals of all time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a prime showcase of &ldquo;team chemistry over talent&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were one of the most talented teams in NBA history. Four Hall of Fame players and a HoF coach, 62-20 record in the regular season. That they played team ball together was excellent, but they didn&rsquo;t win because they were role players who played well together, they won because they were loaded to the top with talent.</p>

<p>Also, implying that an Erik Spoelstra-coached team somehow relies on raw talent over proper team concepts is&hellip; a take. It&rsquo;s wrong, but it&rsquo;s a take.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heat were far superior in terms of talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they were not, as explained above. Even if they were, the Heat had spent the past four seasons playing into June, and they were physically and mentally exhausted. The 2014 Spurs beat them because they had more talent on the court and were not as tired and broken down as the 2014 Heat.</p>

Analysis by many statisticians showed that the heat were best playing LeBron-ball + shooters surrounding him, hence their dominance in 2012 and 2013 when wade began to take a step back. I don’t think a better 2014 wade makes them win that championship over that legendary spurs team. They would have a much better chance if they traded wade for, hypothetically, kyrie Irving, or another guard that can create but also space the floor off the ball</p>

<p>Elite rim protection, versatile defenders, a bunch of playmakers and shooters everywhere. Duncan was also much closer to a top-5 player that year than people think. He couldn&rsquo;t do it for a full 82-game season, but he absolutely could dominate for stretches and we definitely saw it in the playoffs that year where he would just take over games on both ends of the floor. Miami had no answer for him in the finals.</p>

<p>They really were like a hybrid team. They had some leftover elements from the 2000s but also clear components that would work just fine in 2024.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were the perfect hybrid and had much more of an effect on today&rsquo;s game than the media would like to admit.</p>

And yeah Duncan could go on spurts of elite play but not consistently because he was old (hence the memes of giving him rest days where it literally had (old) in the injury report). Sort of like LeBron now where he can have moments that remind you how fucking good he was but he isn&rsquo;t doing it for every game of a playoff run anymore. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was a consistent top 5 tier player on that run.</p>

<p>The modern offensive flow in particular I agree with, that team moved the ball in a way that was breathtaking at the time and even now can be inspiring to watch. Selfless ball is my favorite type.</p>

<p>Cs are honestly both a suffocating defense like the &lsquo;04 Pistons and (when humming) an unselfish opportunistic offense like the &lsquo;14 Spurs. Their defense is way more reliable, though. It&rsquo;s unfortunate they couldn&rsquo;t showcase the offense as well for the fans this Finals.</p>

It is fundementally not possible to be as much of a defensive juggernaut as the Pistons were both because of spacing and even more so the rules and officiating favors the offense more now than it did then.</p>

<p>That is not a knock on the Celtics. They are a more talented team than the Pistons were. But you do not get to play defense at the level they did in this era, even beyond the differences in spacing.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t include overlapping stretches by the same core rosters.</p>

<p>The 2024 Celtics were <em>only</em> at a 106.1 DefRtg+. The Celtics were an all time great playoff defense but didn&rsquo;t perform to the level of <em>the</em> all time greats.</p>

      <label for="l9t5a4d" class="commentText"><p>Interesting! Where did you find this data?</p>

<p>2024 Celtics also wouldn&rsquo;t qualify due to minutes played, right? 19 games * 48min+ 1 OT *5min = 917 minutes.</p>

<p>Also, it might be clearer to just use the percentage (e.g. +11.6% instead of 111.6) since DRtg is usually better the lower it is.</p>

<p>No, they wouldn&rsquo;t qualify. I just chose 1000 MP for simplicity sake. If I dropped it to 900 MP and ignored teams from the stretches I already listed you&rsquo;d get down to the 2024 Celtics without much tangible difference in their historical standing whether you look at 900 vs 1000.</p>

<p>I see your point about DefRtg being a stat that&rsquo;s better the lower the number is. In baseball a lower ERA is better but ERA+ is still a number that tracks positive going higher above 100. I figured it best to follow that established convention of the adjusted stats even when it may feel unintuitive.</p>

No other DPOY level player comes even close to being a 40% 3 point shooter. Then you have Danny Green who would probably be considered the best ever typical role player 3 and d guy. Not a super star but can play all-nba level defense while always being a consistent 3 point shooter. And he may not be considered elite but Patty Mills got himself a 15 year career being a very consistent 3 and d level guy. And then add in Manu Ginobli who was always a good 3 point shooter but started to become a really pesty defender at this stage in his career as well.</p>

      <label for="l9t4iqo" class="commentText"><p>Yep. It’s kind of like saying Pujols was always a sub-.300 hitter because his career AVG dropped to under .300 at the end of a 22 year career. Ignoring that he had like the best AVG in all of baseball over his first decade in the league (.331).</p>

      <label for="l9som4g" class="commentText"><p>Duncan wasn’t quiet though.</p>

<p>From 99-07 he won 4 titles and 3 Finals MVPs while averaging 24 and 13 in the postseason.</p>

<p>His Finals averages in those Finals:</p>

<p>1999: <sup>27</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .537 FG%</p>

<p>2003: <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> on .495 FG%</p>

<p>2005: <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .419 FG%</p>

<p>2007: <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> on .446 FG%</p>

<p>So he’d already had two dominant Finals MVP series before putting up less staggering numbers in later Finals, so his reputation of being able to be the #1 on championship teams had already been established, as by the end of 2003, he had 2 MVPs and 2 Finals MVPs.</p>

      <label for="l9soyzs" class="commentText"><p>Those are purely finals numbers. He dominated entire seasons and playoff runs with far less. As mentioned in a diff post, his playoff averages overtime is 20-10-2. It’s by no means an insult</p>

      <label for="l9spp9n" class="commentText"><p>You really think Duncan gets cooked for either of his first 2 Finals?</p>

<p>From 99-03, his overall playoff averages were <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .504 eFG%.</p>

<p>He had 2 MVPs by then too, averaging <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> on .503 eFG% in the regular season from 99-03.</p>

<p>Anything after that point was gravy for his reputation, as he’d already established he was an elite player (2 MVPs and 6 total Top-5 seasons) along with 2 Finals MVPs with some great playoff runs.</p>

<p>Him not needing to put up crazy numbers in Finals 3-5 is quite different than doing it for your only ring(s).</p>

<p>Thats where he was at after 2003. Anything he did or didn’t do after the 2003 playoffs, his reputation had already been pretty firmly established IMO.</p>

      <label for="l9srt1y" class="commentText"><p>Yes lol Lebron was getting cooked by the media even after he posted 28/10/7 in 2012 finals after losing two finals appearances. The media criticism went crazy around those first Lebron years. Duncan would always be in “tier 2” by today’s criticisms behind Shaq and Kobe. It would be the “well Duncan is part of a great team” “easy path with Drob” “collective win with manu and Parker and then kawhi”. All I’m saying is they’d make a different narrative for maybe the most famously quiet superstar of all time</p>

      <label for="l9st1rd" class="commentText"><p>LeBron’s criticism was after losing 2 Finals appearances. Duncan won his first 2 Finals appearances. While playing dominantly in both Finals.</p>

<p>Edit: and all of this was by the end of 2003. When Shaq and Kobe were on the same team. There’s no valid criticism that Duncan was just on a great team when the players you said would be viewed as being ahead of him were on the same team.</p>

      <label for="l9tcvyr" class="commentText"><p>Yeah because he played 30% of his career playoff games as a 35+ year old scoring 15 a game&hellip;</p>

<p>By the time he was putting up numbers that would get him smoke, he was past an age where everyone is cooked and it&rsquo;s just impressive he&rsquo;s still a winning player making an impact. It&rsquo;s like clowning on Kareem for not winning FMVP at 39.</p>
