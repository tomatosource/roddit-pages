</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It was a beautiful display of team basketball. Not a single player also had to average more than 35.2 minutes per game, which was averaged by Boris Diaw and Tony Parker.</p>

<p>It was also one of the more efficient scoring Finals for the winning team. The Spurs shot 53% from the field, 47% from 3 and 75% from the foul line. They only lost game 2 by  2 points and won their 4 games by an average point differential of 18.</p>

<p>This was also the last time a team won the Finals without a single player on the winning team averaging less than 20 points.</p>

      <label for="l9smbh3" class="commentText"><p>I think the biggest testament to Pop’s coaching is the fact that the Spurs won in 2003 by playing almost entirely iso ball and feeding Tim Duncan on literally every single possession for the entirety of the finals. Then by the time they won in 2014 they had shifted to playing almost entirely systematic unselfish team ball. He adapted to his roster and his players so well throughout their stretch of competitiveness.</p>

      <label for="l9sq223" class="commentText"><p>Crazy part is, nothing&rsquo;s changed. Spurs ranked #2 in assists per game in the whole league this season. This philosophy translates to the modern spurs demonstrated in one of the last spurs games linked below. The problem is, we&rsquo;re in rebuild mode right now so we don&rsquo;t have many NBA caliber players on our team right now that can consistently knock down shots. But we are constantly still a high assist team. And when everyone&rsquo;s making their shots, it&rsquo;s still beautiful basketball. In the short term, it looks like incompetence by not letting Wemby touch the ball enough. But once the team gets reworked after maybe 1 more year, this is likely the kind of stat sheet that the organization still wants.</p>

      <label for="l9srnwu" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, although I would like to see more of a focus on wemby, i think the system will be able to let him focus more defensively which is where he really shines, while the high passing and movement will still find him for the easy buckets only he can score without him having to shoulder a high offensive load. And the thing that really stands out is even with the whole “wemby cant get the ball cause his teammates cant find him narrative” he still had a crazy high usage rate for a rookie, meaning he was still finishing most plays. Very exciting stuff if we can get players who can run Pops offensive more efficiently, thats what i really liked from Mamu to end the season</p>

      <label for="l9u89gc" class="commentText"><p>The interesting thing is, how will Pop value Wemby’s offense vs defence long term?</p>

<p>I think he’s about to dominate the DPOY awards, unless the Spurs value his scoring &amp; passing enough to game plan that way (e.g. Wemby is not around the paint for blocks &amp; rebounds as much, so he can lead the fast break more often).</p>

      <label for="l9ucea5" class="commentText"><p>Depends on the personnel we end up drafting and how much we need either or from him, as it stands now defensively for sure (although wemby honestly has the greenlight to do whatever he wants), we bleed points with Zach, Malaki, Cedi, etc but if the Spurs keep drafting lengthy guys with size like they have been, there might be a transition to an offense focused wemby</p>

      <label for="l9ud71d" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>My instinct is that defence is the focus, as it makes the game almost suffocating for the opponent. Once Wemby gets more reads, learns more player tendencies &amp; plays a few more minutes a game, the other team has to shoot lights out from 3, get him in foul trouble or they’re toast.</p>

<p>Someone posted Manute Bol getting 4 blocks in under 10 seconds recently, that’s back on the menu with Wemby &amp; it’s going to kick ass.</p>

      <label for="l9swhqw" class="commentText"><p>I think that&rsquo;s the FO&rsquo;s plan. It makes more sense to build depth first from the 2024 and 2025 draft before we go all in on an all-star trade/signing. I think after the 2025 draft during the 2025 off-season is when actual win-now moves will start to be made. Likely this off-season the front office is probably just drafting our 2 lottery picks and signing 1 or 2 minor roleplayers (who admittedly would still be an upgrade from some of our G-Leaguers).</p>

Im not saying I expect them to get to the second round, but even just one round in the playoffs maybe with a play in game or two, would help the org speed things up in terms of setting the right team around Wemby.</p>

      <label for="l9twj38" class="commentText"><p>I think it was less of Pop adapting to his players and more just the gradual evolution to heavy-spacing modern basketball that he, his staff, and his players pioneered. Whether or not Wemby was on the floor, we saw many glimpses of the Beautiful Game even in our bad losses this year. Biggest differences being that our roster is an average of 8 years younger and can&rsquo;t shoot. I expect many great seasons with this Spurs era and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be sharing the ball more than our opponents in our playoff runs, though probably not an entire 157 more passes per game like in 2014.</p>

      <label for="l9tcg2q" class="commentText"><p>depends. if wemby wants to be a star in the limelight he&rsquo;ll leave. if he is submissive he probably just stays. seeing how hes got a personality and seemingly a showman i can see him realizing his loss potential on spurs.</p>

<p>i dont think pop knows how to handle guys that arent like submissive all about the team type. guys like kawhi murray jackson all have spoken on this. and even tonys had his small controversies. players and pop arguing on the side lines werent a rare thing and for guys at this level its hard to supress your ego.</p>

<p>not saying this applies to wemby now but when hes the face of the league but not in every commerical and in all the tabloids. well everyone loves fame and money right. this is why tim and overseas players have worked well</p>

<p>if wemby was a laker then he would have been the most talked about athlete last year</p>

      <label for="l9u3u38" class="commentText"><p>This is slightly ironic given he played for the same coach and hall of famer cast for nearly 20 years.</p>

<p>And the fact that he simply minimized his role and played 30 MPG towards the final third of his career.</p>

<p>Do we credit him with versatility? Credit the system the coach created? Credit the continuity of talent? Credit the supporting cast that allowed him to take rest games, minutes / load management?</p>

      <label for="l9szth7" class="commentText"><p>I think some people forget the Spurs won 67 and 61 games with Kawhi and LeMarcus Aldridge kind of taking turns but with lots of flow. And still won 48 and 47 games with DeRozan and Aldridge def taking turns playing midrange iso maestro.</p>

<p>IMO Pop adapts to his roster, not just their talents but also their personalities. A lot of people forget the Beautiful Game was driven from the bench with Manu, Boris Diaw, and Patty Mills. But with Kawhi/DeRozan and LMA the team needed them to finish possessions by doing their thing.</p>

Might be a simple clock with no real chance for reversal by then (assuming we don&rsquo;t invent our way out of it like we did with the Ozone layer), but it&rsquo;d still take about 100 years for us to be obliterated even in some of the worst scenarios. I don&rsquo;t think Global Nuclear war is particularly likely, but I cannot think of anything else that would do that in the next ten years other than a surprise astroid or a surprise yellowstone that happened to be big enough to kill everyone that quickly. So basically the under is saying you think it&rsquo;s more likely that nuclear war happens.</p>

      <label for="l9snr2t" class="commentText"><p>That Spurs team was a buzzsaw.</p>

<p>I think people mischaracterize the 2014 Spurs as a team with a bunch of role players, but the fact of the matter is that that team was LOADED. They basically went 10 deep, even in the playoffs when rotations typically shrink to seven players, maybe eight.</p>

<p>Did they have one dominant scorer? No, but they had so many good players that they were able to evenly distribute the wealth. Plus they had shooters everywhere.</p>

<p>They would go on runs where they would just rip the heart out of their opponents. Just look what they did to Miami in the finals that year. They would end games within a span of three minutes, very similar to the Warriors.</p>

<p>Duncan tends to be very underrated from that year, too. He was still genuinely elite. He just had to coast more because he was older, but he was still one of the league&rsquo;s best defensive players and could absolutely dominate for stretches offensively when he needed to.</p>

<p>The Spurs had two of those guys with Kawhi and Danny.</p>

<p>We also had a good playoff scorer and playmaker in Parker. An elite rim protector in Duncan. The best 6th man in the NBA in Manu. I haven’t even gotten to Boris Diaw or Tiago Splitter.</p>

<p>Teams like the 2014 Spurs or 2004 Pistons people get too romantic with. They talk about them like they’re protagonists in a sports movie about teamwork overcoming talent and the players being more than the sum of their parts.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were stacked with talent. They would have been an all time great regular season team if they didn’t have so many guys miss a game here or there due to an injury or rest.</p>

      <label for="l9tqjux" class="commentText"><p>OKC did match up really well against them. If Ibaka were healthy that could have gone like 2016.</p>

<p>The Thunder were always the team that scared me the most back then. Even after we lost to the Heat in 2013 I was just pissed we choked. I was still more afraid of the Thunder than the Heat.</p>

<p>This was B2B same finals matchup where Heat beat Spurs in the previous year. For people not familiar with this era, Heat were far superior in terms of talent. But Spurs were actually a better team. Not only they got their revenge in 2014, they were winning the 2013 finals for the most part too. It was a prime showcase of &ldquo;team chemistry over talent&rdquo;.</p>

LeBron&rsquo;s teams were looking very good on the way to the Finals due to the lack of any serious competition in the East. I think this helps explain why people were surprised that each Finals ended up being so lop-sided. Even in 2017 against the KD Warriors, I remember a lot of chatter about the Cavs having a historically good offense, possibly making for an interesting series.</p>

<p>Same thing in the finals, game 1 was extremely close up until LeBron got cramps and the Heat took game 2. People expected a close series going back to Miami and the Spurs just took off. I remember LeBron exploding on several first quarters just to keep up with the Spurs but he just couldn’t keep it up for the entire game.</p>

It didn&rsquo;t seem like much at the time - especially down 18 in game 4, but Ibaka had owned the paint the entire series (~3.5 bpg).   This dunk was a bench guy going fearlessly at a guy that had been dominating the Spurs defensively.  The Spurs steamrolled game 5, took game 6, and then ran through Miami.</p>

<p>they were winning the 2013 finals for the most part too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. The 2013 Finals was a series where every possession mattered because the teams were perfectly matched. That series was as close as I&rsquo;ve ever seen to truly balanced matchup, and I think it&rsquo;s the greatest NBA Finals of all time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a prime showcase of &ldquo;team chemistry over talent&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were one of the most talented teams in NBA history. Four Hall of Fame players and a HoF coach, 62-20 record in the regular season. That they played team ball together was excellent, but they didn&rsquo;t win because they were role players who played well together, they won because they were loaded to the top with talent.</p>

<p>Also, implying that an Erik Spoelstra-coached team somehow relies on raw talent over proper team concepts is&hellip; a take. It&rsquo;s wrong, but it&rsquo;s a take.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heat were far superior in terms of talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they were not, as explained above. Even if they were, the Heat had spent the past four seasons playing into June, and they were physically and mentally exhausted. The 2014 Spurs beat them because they had more talent on the court and were not as tired and broken down as the 2014 Heat.</p>

      <label for="l9uf32u" class="commentText"><p>10 deep is really underrated honestly. Thats 3 extra players at minimum compared to nearly every team that you can trust to play and play well. Also Wade was not the same player at that point. He had 4 less points and half the assists. His knees had really lost it at this point. He couldn&rsquo;t put the same level of offensive pressure on a defense. Honestly it surprises me how few people seem to remember the beauty of the pick and roll that Miami did was. Bosh was an elite screen and roll player for them. I guess I remember cause Bosh was and is my favorite player ever.</p>

      <label for="l9ufm6p" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s absolutely not how it&rsquo;s perceived that day. Parker is the only all-nba type of player, and even then there are still many players that people choose over him. Even at PG position people generally rate CP3 much higher than him despite the ring differences and team records. And he&rsquo;s simply not on the level of the Lebrons and the Durants or even Paul Georges. Parker is stilled skillful and speedy but he&rsquo;s no where near his prime&rsquo;s speed. Plus injuries as well I think since during the OKC series?</p>

<p>Duncan is a super old guy who can protect the rim very well but mediocre on offense.</p>

<p>Manu is very unpredictable, and as he aged he is much less reliable (as in 2013).</p>

<p>Danny green is someone who get bounced around the league and finally become a excellent 3&amp;D - who can barely dribble.</p>

<p>Kawhi is just a young guy who is like a 3&amp;D plus</p>

<p>Tiago is just a pretty good center, but never get to star-level.</p>

<p>Boris Diaw is cut by the Bobcats. He&rsquo;s skillful but pretty unmotivated and undisiciplined.</p>

<p>Patty Mills barely crack in the rotation even in 2013, who is just a super undersized guard who can shoot.</p>

<p>Marco Belinelli is a crafty movement shooter who can barely defend</p>

<p>Cory Joseph is a undersized defensive guard who can&rsquo;t slash fast and can&rsquo;t shoot.</p>

<p>Matt Boner is&hellip;.a personality, who is a slow big that can shoot 3s but can barely defend.</p>

<p>TLDR:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This team&rsquo;s 4HOF is either way past their prime (with the exception of Parker, where his prime starts to fade) or still very early in the league (Kawhi). Check out the all-star vote or all-nba selection back then.</p></li>

<li><p>Their role players are not super talented. More like they have some unique skillsets that can complement each other if they can play together well. And that&rsquo;s what the Spurs did.</p></li>

<li><p>No this team is not &lsquo;super-talented&rsquo; Without a good system a good coach and an established culture, that team could barely make the playoff.</p></li>

Analysis by many statisticians showed that the heat were best playing LeBron-ball + shooters surrounding him, hence their dominance in 2012 and 2013 when wade began to take a step back. I don’t think a better 2014 wade makes them win that championship over that legendary spurs team. They would have a much better chance if they traded wade for, hypothetically, kyrie Irving, or another guard that can create but also space the floor off the ball</p>

      <label for="l9sltdb" class="commentText"><p>And before that the 2004 Pistons won with a team based game though more predicated on crazy defense that would not be possible in today&rsquo;s spacing.</p>

<p>It is wild that 3 decades in a row in the &lsquo;4 year of that decade a team that doesn&rsquo;t fit the traditional model (top 5 tier player with a good team around them) wins the title, but instead one built more around a complete team.</p>

      <label for="l9soy0q" class="commentText"><p>The 2014 Spurs were a prototype for the modern model.</p>

<p>Elite rim protection, versatile defenders, a bunch of playmakers and shooters everywhere. Duncan was also much closer to a top-5 player that year than people think. He couldn&rsquo;t do it for a full 82-game season, but he absolutely could dominate for stretches and we definitely saw it in the playoffs that year where he would just take over games on both ends of the floor. Miami had no answer for him in the finals.</p>

<p>They really were like a hybrid team. They had some leftover elements from the 2000s but also clear components that would work just fine in 2024.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs were the perfect hybrid and had much more of an effect on today&rsquo;s game than the media would like to admit.</p>

      <label for="l9sprru" class="commentText"><p>I would agree with a lot of this. And yeah Duncan could go on spurts of elite play but not consistently because he was old (hence the memes of giving him rest days where it literally had (old) in the injury report). Sort of like LeBron now where he can have moments that remind you how fucking good he was but he isn&rsquo;t doing it for every game of a playoff run anymore. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was a consistent top 5 tier player on that run.</p>

<p>The modern offensive flow in particular I agree with, that team moved the ball in a way that was breathtaking at the time and even now can be inspiring to watch. Selfless ball is my favorite type.</p>

      <label for="l9u1voe" class="commentText"><p>The thing with the spurs is they had so many guys who could all pass, cut, and make plays off the dribble. Manu, Parker, Duncan, Mills, Diaw. Then you had Kawhi, Splitter, and Green who were perfect at their roles defending and playing without the ball. The warriors and Celtics are the only teams who have been able to replicate that. Most modern teams are like the nuggets or lakers or Mavs where the star players are the hubs who generate 90% of the offense.</p>

      <label for="l9stnt8" class="commentText"><p>Was the Celtics&rsquo; defense this year not crazy despite today&rsquo;s spacing? They won all 4 Finals games by holding their opponent under 100 points (89, 98, 99, 88) and barely breaking 100 themselves (107, 105, 106, 106).</p>

<p>Cs are honestly both a suffocating defense like the &lsquo;04 Pistons and (when humming) an unselfish opportunistic offense like the &lsquo;14 Spurs. Their defense is way more reliable, though. It&rsquo;s unfortunate they couldn&rsquo;t showcase the offense as well for the fans this Finals.</p>

      <label for="l9sxjjy" class="commentText"><p>No, no it was not as crazy. They were holding the Lakers to scores like 68 and 75 throughout that series. It is fundementally not possible to be as much of a defensive juggernaut as the Pistons were both because of spacing and even more so the rules and officiating favors the offense more now than it did then.</p>

<p>That is not a knock on the Celtics. They are a more talented team than the Pistons were. But you do not get to play defense at the level they did in this era, even beyond the differences in spacing.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t include overlapping stretches by the same core rosters.</p>

<p>The 2024 Celtics were <em>only</em> at a 106.1 DefRtg+. The Celtics were an all time great playoff defense but didn&rsquo;t perform to the level of <em>the</em> all time greats.</p>

      <label for="l9t5a4d" class="commentText"><p>Interesting! Where did you find this data?</p>

<p>2024 Celtics also wouldn&rsquo;t qualify due to minutes played, right? 19 games * 48min+ 1 OT *5min = 917 minutes.</p>

<p>Also, it might be clearer to just use the percentage (e.g. +11.6% instead of 111.6) since DRtg is usually better the lower it is.</p>

<p>No, they wouldn&rsquo;t qualify. I just chose 1000 MP for simplicity sake. If I dropped it to 900 MP and ignored teams from the stretches I already listed you&rsquo;d get down to the 2024 Celtics without much tangible difference in their historical standing whether you look at 900 vs 1000.</p>

<p>I see your point about DefRtg being a stat that&rsquo;s better the lower the number is. In baseball a lower ERA is better but ERA+ is still a number that tracks positive going higher above 100. I figured it best to follow that established convention of the adjusted stats even when it may feel unintuitive.</p>

<p>Duncan obviously didn&rsquo;t do as well in 2014, but was one year removed from a 1st team all NBA spot. So though he might not have been a top 10 player during the season, (I am biased but) theres not ten guys I would&rsquo;ve chosen in the playoffs over him.</p>

      <label for="l9t8hv3" class="commentText"><p>There level of 3 and d was just nuts. Kawhi is probably the best ever at being both an elite defender and elite 3 point shooter. No other DPOY level player comes even close to being a 40% 3 point shooter. Then you have Danny Green who would probably be considered the best ever typical role player 3 and d guy. Not a super star but can play all-nba level defense while always being a consistent 3 point shooter. And he may not be considered elite but Patty Mills got himself a 15 year career being a very consistent 3 and d level guy. And then add in Manu Ginobli who was always a good 3 point shooter but started to become a really pesty defender at this stage in his career as well.</p>

      <label for="l9tus3h" class="commentText"><p>Manu was always a great defender, it was just in his later years when he was less physical offensively that his defence was highlighted.</p>

<p>It was what set him apart the most from Tony.  From his rookie season onwards Manu was an elite defensive player.  It is hard to get much defensive recognition when you play with Duncan and Bowen though.  Because, for the first 10 years of his career, he was only the 2nd best perimeter defender on the team, he didn&rsquo;t get much media attention but he was elite.</p>

      <label for="l9solrk" class="commentText"><p>Eras or just really on paper in general. It’s a good jumping off point in some cases with like for like players. I mean peak Kawhi is the most dominant player I’ve seen in the Bron aside from Bron himself but his stats don’t tell the whole story either</p>

      <label for="l9t1bur" class="commentText"><p>That’s for his CAREER. He had better playoff numbers in his first 2 championship runs, proving he could be the clear #1 on a title-winning team while also winning 2 MVPs.</p>

<p>After 2003, he had 2 MVPs and 2 Finals MVPs while averaging 24/13/4 with 3+ blocks per game over his postseason career at that point.</p>

      <label for="l9t32n4" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s because he had a long playoff career with multiple finals runs in his late 30s. Even players today, if they played competitively until they were 40 would experience the same dilution of playoff stats (Lebron is the freaky exception). Also, convenient you rounded down 20.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.0 to 20/10/2. 3 magically being 2 is sneaky sneaky.</p>

      <label for="l9som4g" class="commentText"><p>Duncan wasn’t quiet though.</p>

<p>From 99-07 he won 4 titles and 3 Finals MVPs while averaging 24 and 13 in the postseason.</p>

<p>His Finals averages in those Finals:</p>

<p>1999: <sup>27</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .537 FG%</p>

<p>2003: <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> on .495 FG%</p>

<p>2005: <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .419 FG%</p>

<p>2007: <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> on .446 FG%</p>

<p>So he’d already had two dominant Finals MVP series before putting up less staggering numbers in later Finals, so his reputation of being able to be the #1 on championship teams had already been established, as by the end of 2003, he had 2 MVPs and 2 Finals MVPs.</p>

      <label for="l9soyzs" class="commentText"><p>Those are purely finals numbers. He dominated entire seasons and playoff runs with far less. As mentioned in a diff post, his playoff averages overtime is 20-10-2. It’s by no means an insult</p>

      <label for="l9spp9n" class="commentText"><p>You really think Duncan gets cooked for either of his first 2 Finals?</p>

<p>From 99-03, his overall playoff averages were <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> on .504 eFG%.</p>

<p>He had 2 MVPs by then too, averaging <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> on .503 eFG% in the regular season from 99-03.</p>

<p>Anything after that point was gravy for his reputation, as he’d already established he was an elite player (2 MVPs and 6 total Top-5 seasons) along with 2 Finals MVPs with some great playoff runs.</p>

<p>Him not needing to put up crazy numbers in Finals 3-5 is quite different than doing it for your only ring(s).</p>

<p>Thats where he was at after 2003. Anything he did or didn’t do after the 2003 playoffs, his reputation had already been pretty firmly established IMO.</p>

      <label for="l9srt1y" class="commentText"><p>Yes lol Lebron was getting cooked by the media even after he posted 28/10/7 in 2012 finals after losing two finals appearances. The media criticism went crazy around those first Lebron years. Duncan would always be in “tier 2” by today’s criticisms behind Shaq and Kobe. It would be the “well Duncan is part of a great team” “easy path with Drob” “collective win with manu and Parker and then kawhi”. All I’m saying is they’d make a different narrative for maybe the most famously quiet superstar of all time</p>

      <label for="l9st1rd" class="commentText"><p>LeBron’s criticism was after losing 2 Finals appearances. Duncan won his first 2 Finals appearances. While playing dominantly in both Finals.</p>

<p>Edit: and all of this was by the end of 2003. When Shaq and Kobe were on the same team. There’s no valid criticism that Duncan was just on a great team when the players you said would be viewed as being ahead of him were on the same team.</p>

<p>By the time he was putting up numbers that would get him smoke, he was past an age where everyone is cooked and it&rsquo;s just impressive he&rsquo;s still a winning player making an impact. It&rsquo;s like clowning on Kareem for not winning FMVP at 39.</p>
