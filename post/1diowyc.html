      <label for="l956bxc" class="commentText"><p>I hope that Sam Hauser’s performance last night is not forgotten. the ECF was a real struggle for him but his performance last night and in this series was absolutely stellar. that man will be getting a bag next offseason and he’ll deserve it</p>

<p>Mavs giving up those runs at the end of each of the first two quarters were where they lost this game imo. to their credit they didn’t roll over but honestly the Pritchard shot seemed like the death blow for Dallas just based on the reactions of both teams when it went in</p>

<p>Tatum was brilliant last night and it speaks volumes to his growth as an all-around player (as well as the incredible team around him) that he had the worst shooting postseason of his career and still managed to lead a 16-3 championship team in points, rebounds, assists and plus-minus</p>

<p>this postseason was Jaylen Brown’s redemption and his arrival as a bonafide top 15-20 player. think he’s proven he’s one of the top 3 best second options in the league</p>

<p>feels fucking good to be back on top.</p>

      <label for="l9559gd" class="commentText"><p>Tatum wasn&rsquo;t efficient, while Brown had a handful of clutch and exciting moments. Tatum was the steady offensive engine, but Brown had the flash. Also, Brown&rsquo;s most important role doesn&rsquo;t show up on the stat sheet: guarding Luka Doncic. He was the primary defender there and Doncic only had 2 good games.</p>

<p>Also, after Game 3, it was evident that Brown had the better Games 1-3. This series was effectively over after Game 3. Games 4 and 5 were kind of like Finals garbage time.</p>

<p>Like the ECF MVP, I do think this one could have gone either way though. Both were deserving, but Brown got it.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think it&rsquo;s one of those rare occurrances where a &ldquo;Co MVP&rdquo; would have made a lot of sense.</p>

      <label for="l95cccb" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily disagree - but I think the voters would see JBs flashy plays and against their best player 1-1. (Mostly I think the voters look at stats on offense and flashy plays on defense - and choose from there, rather than actual knowing ball.)</p>

<p>I personally thought that JT should have gotten the FMVP but it was close IMO.</p>

      <label for="l95c3hd" class="commentText"><p>I think browns defense on luka plus him making key shots throughout the playoffs is what got him over the hump. Starting with the 3 to send it to overtime vs the pacers in game 1 and ending with the pull up to stop a mavs run and help seal the deal in game 3. Brown hit big shots for us all playoffs. He also guarded luka 94 ft, and helped to slow him down. They held luka and the mavs under 100 points 4 times.</p>

      <label for="l957jlw" class="commentText"><p>Kind of funny that Boston dominated for the entirety of the regular season yet it still was a surprise they dominated in the post-season. It is always somewhat satisfying to see a team really take advantage of their window of opportunity and Boston did it to near perfection &ndash; even with how they managed Porzingis.</p>

<p>Dallas is good but really has a lot of work to do. Isolation basketball isn&rsquo;t as rewarding in the playoffs yet their ability to get this far in doing so just speaks to the talent they have. Kidd probably isn&rsquo;t the coach to get it done and really like the strategic poise to make it a competitive series but have to respect what everyone in that organization managed to do to even get them to this point.</p>

      <label for="l95dgcq" class="commentText"><p>This one just felt so nice.</p>

<p>2008 was fun as hell, but after being barely a 20-win team the year before, it just felt sudden and a bit artificial. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe that&rsquo;s a me thing. We embraced KG and he embraced Boston, but we won it his first year here before we really had a chance to build a culture around that team.</p>

<p>This time it&rsquo;s so different. 6-7 years of tinkering with the roster to get it just right. We brought in superstars, we brought in complimentary pieces, we switched coaches. This one really feels like a great team reaching their full potential. Not just Brown and Tatum, but seeing guys like DWhite take that leap, Al continuing to contribute in his role, Hauser improving his defense enough to get big minutes in big games. Then you add guys like Jrue and KP, who deserved this so much. This one felt so satisfying.</p>

<p>I know people clown on this team and on JT. Whatever, a banner is a banner and this one feels amazing. I&rsquo;m so glad we have a guy like Joe at the helm. I think his energy is exactly what this team needs. A hardass will not get these guys out of their own heads when they give up a big run. An analytics guy won&rsquo;t get through to them and get them away from ISO ball in the 4th. A guy like Joe just got them to buy-in and truly play team basketball.</p>

      <label for="l9563k1" class="commentText"><p>A very satisfying win for Boston. Jaylen’s record contract was clowned and he gave it right back to them immediately. Tatum gets his championship too, but stays hungry for another one and to win a FMVP. 16 years exactly from the previous title. Mazzulla inherits a stacked roster that is 6-deep, manages the egos and expectations and converts it into a title. One with record margins and several records broken.</p>

<p>Some say Curry ruined the league, well this is that nightmare on steroids. 5 out, drive, kick, zip zip 3. Even KP and Horford spacing out to the line. But this title started and ended with elite defense above all.</p>

      <label for="l958q3k" class="commentText"><p>This team will be better remembered as the years go on. I kind of think of them like the early 90s Blazers, skilled up and down the roster but with the nagging tendency to self destruct at times and the label that they would always do so if you let them. That, plus running into teams with a better overall #1 option (Isiah/Magic/MJ) rendered them a what-if; hell, Clyde Drexler is occasionally better known for being a champ in Houston.</p>

<p>This team got their ring. It won&rsquo;t stop the criticism today about not being perfect, but it will be their hallmark no matter what happens in the future. They tried and tried and tried and will never have to ask &ldquo;What if.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l95af1z" class="commentText"><p>Maybe for the first time all Finals, Dončić’s problem wasn’t his attitude. I think that’s a big step for him to be one of the best players out there, if he can learn to maintain a bit more poise like he did last night, as opposed to letting Boston get a fast break while talking to the refs.</p>

      <label for="l95b396" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I&rsquo;m just really happy.  It&rsquo;s been so long and this team finally had it all.</p>

<p>Almost no minute of this roster was ever wasted this year either.</p>

<p>Despite not getting much meaninful play time these last 2 games, Pritchard was incredible all year for Boston and actually held up well this series when he did play and his half court shots will be remembered in the legendary playoff run.</p>

<p>Also Hauser really stepped the fuck up these finals after a TERRIBLE postseason run.  His efforts in all 4 wins legitimately were huge&hellip;especially off the ball and all the physical moments like creating or fighting for turnovers.  Then finally his shot was going down.</p>

<p>But man&hellip;seeing old man Al out there just play like a champ one more time and finally getting his ring is so fucking sweet.  Whether he&rsquo;s back or not, this year was so worth it.</p>

<p>Thank God Brad saw what was needed to get over the hump by grabbing Jrue and KP.  GM Brad always knew what coach Brad wanted that Ainge never really pulled the trigger on all these years.  His trading has been instrumental and got us two amazing pieces.</p>

<p>I agree with JB, felt like could have been co-MVPs.  Having the Jays win one and watching them embrace on court together?  Cathartic really. I cried.</p>

<p>I love this team so much.</p>

      <label for="l95fyr0" class="commentText"><p>Well that is it. The race for banner no. 18 goes to the Celtics as they now complete a truly dominant season.</p>

<p>Tatum was the best player on the floor and after a relatively cautious start it was all Boston, once Tatum had Lively or Gafford guarding him in switches it was pretty much game over. The Celtics were picking up Luka so far from the basket with a mini-zone being played at the halfcourt line and it worked a treat.</p>

<p>This series in general just boils down to the Mavs not creating off the dribble and not taking (or even being able to attempt) enough 3s. Celtics weren’t even that great offensively and this series was well, not close.</p>

<p>Commiserations to the Mavericks for getting walloped despite coming out of what was one of the tightest conference ever. Despite a slow start to the season with injuries, they got healthy and made some big-time additions at the deadline and they&rsquo;ve continued impressive form since. It was a rough end to what was otherwise a tremendous success, Lively was pretty much the best playoff rookie in ages and they had plenty of bright spots with Washington/Jones Jr./Gafford and others as well. For as injured as Luka was, making the Finals honestly is a huge success notwithstanding the injuries and it has definitely bought the Mavs franchise a ton of goodwill over the next couple seasons. This is a very young team too, so I&rsquo;m very excited for how they shape up next season.</p>

<p>And for the Celtics, what can I say? Just a fabulously well-controlled season from start to finish, they had new roles for their 2 big acquisitions in Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis as well as a new bench role for Al Horford. Tatum and Brown definitely came out with more well-rounded versions of themselves and their bench was just so impressive given how much of a jump they made (especially Hauser and Pritchard). They obliterated the field in the regular season (especially the east) and pulled a historic gap down to the other east seeds, then cruised through the playoffs and Finals the entire playoffs even without Porzingis for the grand majority of it. Honestly, congratulations. This is undoubtedly historic stuff and they earned their way after a string of playoff heartbreaks. (Also shoutout Billy King, cuz why not lol)</p>

<p>Brown was a well-deserved Finals MVP and now we&rsquo;re back to the trend where PoA defenders are now recognized for their defense in consideration of the Finals MVP award which is great. It wasn&rsquo;t quite the epic banger of a playoff run that many hoped for, but they got it done and that&rsquo;s what matters. And there is more to come for this team and in particular the Jays which is quite the terrifying thought.</p>

<p>Thus comes the end of the 2024 season. Not quite the end I hoped for, certainly in regards to lopsided Conference Finals/Finals series, but this season brought the sort of excitement I haven&rsquo;t seen in some time. The west had one of the best playoff races ever in the regular season and the east on their own right had an extremely competitive seeding battle from 2nd~8th so it was a good reminder of how important the regular season is after fake bottom seeds making deep runs last playoffs. We had some epic moments especially in the first 2 rounds, some classic and legendary battles and I really enjoyed this season despite the Warriors not making it far.</p>

<p>Also shoutout Joe Mazzulla for taking over from an extremely uncharted territory as a head coach and doing what he did. I can proudly say my eye test on this Celtics team has largely been very correct lol.</p>

<p>With how busy I will get this is very likely my last post-game thread (at least the last one I do on even a semi-consistent basis) and I&rsquo;ve whiffed on consistently doing these this playoffs, but I just ran out of time. If you enjoyed this for 3 seasons now, thanks and always. If I have time, I&rsquo;ll hang around in these threads but it was a pleasure reading and writing these discussions.</p>

<p>And once again, congratulations to the Celtics on their record 18th title.</p>
