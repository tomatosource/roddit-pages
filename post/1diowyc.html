      <label for="l956bxc" class="commentText"><p>I hope that Sam Hauser’s performance last night is not forgotten. the ECF was a real struggle for him but his performance last night and in this series was absolutely stellar. that man will be getting a bag next offseason and he’ll deserve it</p>

<p>Mavs giving up those runs at the end of each of the first two quarters were where they lost this game imo. to their credit they didn’t roll over but honestly the Pritchard shot seemed like the death blow for Dallas just based on the reactions of both teams when it went in</p>

<p>Tatum was brilliant last night and it speaks volumes to his growth as an all-around player (as well as the incredible team around him) that he had the worst shooting postseason of his career and still managed to lead a 16-3 championship team in points, rebounds, assists and plus-minus</p>

<p>this postseason was Jaylen Brown’s redemption and his arrival as a bonafide top 15-20 player. think he’s proven he’s one of the top 3 best second options in the league</p>

<p>feels fucking good to be back on top.</p>

      <label for="l9559gd" class="commentText"><p>Tatum wasn&rsquo;t efficient, while Brown had a handful of clutch and exciting moments. Tatum was the steady offensive engine, but Brown had the flash. Also, Brown&rsquo;s most important role doesn&rsquo;t show up on the stat sheet: guarding Luka Doncic. He was the primary defender there and Doncic only had 2 good games.</p>

<p>Also, after Game 3, it was evident that Brown had the better Games 1-3. This series was effectively over after Game 3. Games 4 and 5 were kind of like Finals garbage time.</p>

<p>Like the ECF MVP, I do think this one could have gone either way though. Both were deserving, but Brown got it.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think it&rsquo;s one of those rare occurrances where a &ldquo;Co MVP&rdquo; would have made a lot of sense.</p>

      <label for="l957jlw" class="commentText"><p>Kind of funny that Boston dominated for the entirety of the regular season yet it still was a surprise they dominated in the post-season. It is always somewhat satisfying to see a team really take advantage of their window of opportunity and Boston did it to near perfection &ndash; even with how they managed Porzingis.</p>

<p>Dallas is good but really has a lot of work to do. Isolation basketball isn&rsquo;t as rewarding in the playoffs yet their ability to get this far in doing so just speaks to the talent they have. Kidd probably isn&rsquo;t the coach to get it done and really like the strategic poise to make it a competitive series but have to respect what everyone in that organization managed to do to even get them to this point.</p>

      <label for="l9563k1" class="commentText"><p>A very satisfying win for Boston. Jaylen’s record contract was clowned and he gave it right back to them immediately. Tatum gets his championship too, but stays hungry for another one and to win a FMVP. 16 years exactly from the previous title. Mazzulla inherits a stacked roster that is 6-deep, manages the egos and expectations and converts it into a title. One with record margins and several records broken.</p>

<p>Some say Curry ruined the league, well this is that nightmare on steroids. 5 out, drive, kick, zip zip 3. Even KP and Horford spacing out to the line. But this title started and ended with elite defense above all.</p>

      <label for="l958q3k" class="commentText"><p>This team will be better remembered as the years go on. I kind of think of them like the early 90s Blazers, skilled up and down the roster but with the nagging tendency to self destruct at times and the label that they would always do so if you let them. That, plus running into teams with a better overall #1 option (Isiah/Magic/MJ) rendered them a what-if; hell, Clyde Drexler is occasionally better known for being a champ in Houston.</p>

<p>This team got their ring. It won&rsquo;t stop the criticism today about not being perfect, but it will be their hallmark no matter what happens in the future. They tried and tried and tried and will never have to ask &ldquo;What if.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l95af1z" class="commentText"><p>Maybe for the first time all Finals, Dončić’s problem wasn’t his attitude. I think that’s a big step for him to be one of the best players out there, if he can learn to maintain a bit more poise like he did last night, as opposed to letting Boston get a fast break while talking to the refs.</p>
