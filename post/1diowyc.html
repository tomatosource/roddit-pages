      <label for="l956bxc" class="commentText"><p>I hope that Sam Hauser’s performance last night is not forgotten. the ECF was a real struggle for him but his performance last night and in this series was absolutely stellar. that man will be getting a bag next offseason and he’ll deserve it</p>

<p>Mavs giving up those runs at the end of each of the first two quarters were where they lost this game imo. to their credit they didn’t roll over but honestly the Pritchard shot seemed like the death blow for Dallas just based on the reactions of both teams when it went in</p>

<p>Tatum was brilliant last night and it speaks volumes to his growth as an all-around player (as well as the incredible team around him) that he had the worst shooting postseason of his career and still managed to lead a 16-3 championship team in points, rebounds, assists and plus-minus</p>

<p>this postseason was Jaylen Brown’s redemption and his arrival as a bonafide top 15-20 player. think he’s proven he’s one of the top 3 best second options in the league</p>

<p>feels fucking good to be back on top.</p>

<p>I think teams believe he is the weakest link, which may just mean he is a good defender on a team of great ones. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to work when they hunt him though.</p>

      <label for="l95jhuj" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s true but I&rsquo;m deadass convinced teams only hunt him the way they do because of how he looks. It&rsquo;s probably his frame, he looks as skinny as someone like Herro yet he&rsquo;s fairly strong and nimble but guys with archetypes similar to Herro get shredded defensively against bully ball.</p>

<p>For ages Looney&rsquo;s goofy-looking frame and movement was also the only reason why teams insisted on getting him out on the perimeter. I will admit being on the neutral side of it is unimaginably comical.</p>

      <label for="l957jlw" class="commentText"><p>Kind of funny that Boston dominated for the entirety of the regular season yet it still was a surprise they dominated in the post-season. It is always somewhat satisfying to see a team really take advantage of their window of opportunity and Boston did it to near perfection &ndash; even with how they managed Porzingis.</p>

<p>Dallas is good but really has a lot of work to do. Isolation basketball isn&rsquo;t as rewarding in the playoffs yet their ability to get this far in doing so just speaks to the talent they have. Kidd probably isn&rsquo;t the coach to get it done and really like the strategic poise to make it a competitive series but have to respect what everyone in that organization managed to do to even get them to this point.</p>

      <label for="l95dgcq" class="commentText"><p>This one just felt so nice.</p>

<p>2008 was fun as hell, but after being barely a 20-win team the year before, it just felt sudden and a bit artificial. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe that&rsquo;s a me thing. We embraced KG and he embraced Boston, but we won it his first year here before we really had a chance to build a culture around that team.</p>

<p>This time it&rsquo;s so different. 6-7 years of tinkering with the roster to get it just right. We brought in superstars, we brought in complimentary pieces, we switched coaches. This one really feels like a great team reaching their full potential. Not just Brown and Tatum, but seeing guys like DWhite take that leap, Al continuing to contribute in his role, Hauser improving his defense enough to get big minutes in big games. Then you add guys like Jrue and KP, who deserved this so much. This one felt so satisfying.</p>

<p>I know people clown on this team and on JT. Whatever, a banner is a banner and this one feels amazing. I&rsquo;m so glad we have a guy like Joe at the helm. I think his energy is exactly what this team needs. A hardass will not get these guys out of their own heads when they give up a big run. An analytics guy won&rsquo;t get through to them and get them away from ISO ball in the 4th. A guy like Joe just got them to buy-in and truly play team basketball.</p>

      <label for="l95jcc7" class="commentText"><p>It’s crazy just how much of a narrative shift happens after a win. </p>

<p>JT was humbled and crying.  </p>

<p>JB story and media presence finally rounded out.  </p>

<p>I’m a KP fan and seeing him ball out game 1(?) was so fun.  </p>

<p>As compared to the meltdown to the heat last year now they’re going to be expected to run it back.  </p>

<p>The best team won.  Happy for the fans and everyone.</p>

<p>I don’t see Dallas back in the finals ever again with this crew. </p>

<p>I think you can ignore the warriors and lakers as okc and the spurs will be maturing quickly.    Wolves are in a bad spot and denver will still be in contention.  </p>

<p>Suns are a broken franchise.  </p>

<p>Curious what the Knicks look like next year ! </p>

      <label for="l95mdyy" class="commentText"><p>Bit of both, I&rsquo;d say.</p>

<p>That extreme &ldquo;heliocentric&rdquo; (lol i obviously listen to Russillo) structure can&rsquo;t really succeed deep into the playoffs, because teams are able to make adjustments.  Also, teams just play defense much harder and with more attention than in the regular season.  If your team relies on a single crazy high usage player, that becomes fairly easy to stop or gameplan around in successive series.</p>

<p>That said, it is rare for a team to make the Finals - much less win - without at least one guy who can absolutely get his own.  Usually the teams that make multiple deep runs have 2 scorers that can be relied upon late in a shot clock when all of the actions are done and there&rsquo;s nothing left.  If you don&rsquo;t have a guy or two that can create by themselves, you likely can&rsquo;t win a title.</p>

Tatum gets his championship too, but stays hungry for another one and to win a FMVP. 16 years exactly from the previous title. Mazzulla inherits a stacked roster that is 6-deep, manages the egos and expectations and converts it into a title. One with record margins and several records broken.</p>

<p>Some say Curry ruined the league, well this is that nightmare on steroids. 5 out, drive, kick, zip zip 3. Even KP and Horford spacing out to the line. But this title started and ended with elite defense above all.</p>

      <label for="l9559gd" class="commentText"><p>Tatum wasn&rsquo;t efficient, while Brown had a handful of clutch and exciting moments. Tatum was the steady offensive engine, but Brown had the flash. Also, Brown&rsquo;s most important role doesn&rsquo;t show up on the stat sheet: guarding Luka Doncic. He was the primary defender there and Doncic only had 2 good games.</p>

<p>Also, after Game 3, it was evident that Brown had the better Games 1-3. This series was effectively over after Game 3. Games 4 and 5 were kind of like Finals garbage time.</p>

<p>Like the ECF MVP, I do think this one could have gone either way though. Both were deserving, but Brown got it.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think it&rsquo;s one of those rare occurrances where a &ldquo;Co MVP&rdquo; would have made a lot of sense.</p>

      <label for="l95mwno" class="commentText"><p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t really think anyone on Boston&rsquo;s roster tried all that hard in Game 4.  I don&rsquo;t blame Jaylen at all for taking 4 kind of off, since he had Luka in hell for the first 3 games.</p>

<p>My mini-conspiracy theory is that Boston preferred to lose Game 4 so they could finish up on their home floor.  None of them will ever admit that, and maybe they never said it out loud, but watching their intensity level in that game compared to the other 4 tells me none of the Celtics were all that upset with the loss.</p>

No one is going to man up on the opponent&rsquo;s best player 100% of the possessions, but Brown was tasked with the bulk of the work on Luka, and he was marvelous.  I don&rsquo;t think it can be overstated how the Celtics defense was so frustrating that it caused Luka to foul out of a critical Finals game.</p>

It&rsquo;s just so weird people hand waive his playmaking and assists when contrasted against how few turnovers he coughed up despite being constantly blitzed and double teamed. The Celtics offense isn&rsquo;t even close to a one man show, but Tatum drives the bus. No one else on the team can fill the role he fills.</p>

Starting with the 3 to send it to overtime vs the pacers in game 1 and ending with the pull up to stop a mavs run and help seal the deal in game 3. Brown hit big shots for us all playoffs. He also guarded luka 94 ft, and helped to slow him down. They held luka and the mavs under 100 points 4 times.</p>

<p>JT was the hero in that close out game. He was +8.7 EPM to JB at -0.2 EPM but there’s no doubt that JB had a bigger impact in the first few games. JTs role in those games was mostly on defense and being used to guard a C to prevent the lob, which doesn’t show up on stat sheets.</p>

<p>Glad to have them both. When your first team all-nba doesn’t even need to win FMVP to gentleman’s sweep I have no complaints.</p>

      <label for="l95fyr0" class="commentText"><p>Well that is it. The race for banner no. 18 goes to the Celtics as they now complete a truly dominant season.</p>

<p>Tatum was the best player on the floor and after a relatively cautious start it was all Boston, once Tatum had Lively or Gafford guarding him in switches it was pretty much game over. The Celtics were picking up Luka so far from the basket with a mini-zone being played at the halfcourt line and it worked a treat.</p>

<p>This series in general just boils down to the Mavs not creating off the dribble and not taking (or even being able to attempt) enough 3s. Celtics weren’t even that great offensively and this series was well, not close.</p>

<p>Commiserations to the Mavericks for getting walloped despite coming out of what was one of the tightest conference ever. Despite a slow start to the season with injuries, they got healthy and made some big-time additions at the deadline and they&rsquo;ve continued impressive form since. It was a rough end to what was otherwise a tremendous success, Lively was pretty much the best playoff rookie in ages and they had plenty of bright spots with Washington/Jones Jr./Gafford and others as well. For as injured as Luka was, making the Finals honestly is a huge success notwithstanding the injuries and it has definitely bought the Mavs franchise a ton of goodwill over the next couple seasons. This is a very young team too, so I&rsquo;m very excited for how they shape up next season.</p>

<p>And for the Celtics, what can I say? Just a fabulously well-controlled season from start to finish, they had new roles for their 2 big acquisitions in Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis as well as a new bench role for Al Horford. Tatum and Brown definitely came out with more well-rounded versions of themselves and their bench was just so impressive given how much of a jump they made (especially Hauser and Pritchard). They obliterated the field in the regular season (especially the east) and pulled a historic gap down to the other east seeds, then cruised through the playoffs and Finals the entire playoffs even without Porzingis for the grand majority of it. Honestly, congratulations. This is undoubtedly historic stuff and they earned their way after a string of playoff heartbreaks. (Also shoutout Billy King, cuz why not lol)</p>

<p>Brown was a well-deserved Finals MVP and now we&rsquo;re back to the trend where PoA defenders are now recognized for their defense in consideration of the Finals MVP award which is great. It wasn&rsquo;t quite the epic banger of a playoff run that many hoped for, but they got it done and that&rsquo;s what matters. And there is more to come for this team and in particular the Jays which is quite the terrifying thought.</p>

<p>Thus comes the end of the 2024 season. Not quite the end I hoped for, certainly in regards to lopsided Conference Finals/Finals series, but this season brought the sort of excitement I haven&rsquo;t seen in some time. The west had one of the best playoff races ever in the regular season and the east on their own right had an extremely competitive seeding battle from 2nd~8th so it was a good reminder of how important the regular season is after fake bottom seeds making deep runs last playoffs. We had some epic moments especially in the first 2 rounds, some classic and legendary battles and I really enjoyed this season despite the Warriors not making it far.</p>

<p>Also shoutout Joe Mazzulla for taking over from an extremely uncharted territory as a head coach and doing what he did. I can proudly say my eye test on this Celtics team has largely been very correct lol.</p>

<p>With how busy I will get this is very likely my last post-game thread (at least the last one I do on even a semi-consistent basis) and I&rsquo;ve whiffed on consistently doing these this playoffs, but I just ran out of time. If you enjoyed this for 3 seasons now, thanks and always. If I have time, I&rsquo;ll hang around in these threads but it was a pleasure reading and writing these discussions.</p>

<p>And once again, congratulations to the Celtics on their record 18th title.</p>

      <label for="l958q3k" class="commentText"><p>This team will be better remembered as the years go on. I kind of think of them like the early 90s Blazers, skilled up and down the roster but with the nagging tendency to self destruct at times and the label that they would always do so if you let them. That, plus running into teams with a better overall #1 option (Isiah/Magic/MJ) rendered them a what-if; hell, Clyde Drexler is occasionally better known for being a champ in Houston.</p>

<p>This team got their ring. It won&rsquo;t stop the criticism today about not being perfect, but it will be their hallmark no matter what happens in the future. They tried and tried and tried and will never have to ask &ldquo;What if.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know I’ll get downvoted but this team healthy beats the KD warriors. I said it.</p>

<p>Tin foil time but I think sports betting is to blame for the media coverage of the Celtics. ESPN owns a betting app and they spent the entire post season pretending a 64 win team with the 2nd highest bet rating all time are underdogs. Over half their “experts” picked DAL to win this series despite all data available saying this wouldn’t even be competitive and the Mavs aren’t even the best team we’ve faced this post season.</p>

      <label for="l95b396" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I&rsquo;m just really happy.  It&rsquo;s been so long and this team finally had it all.</p>

<p>Almost no minute of this roster was ever wasted this year either.</p>

<p>Despite not getting much meaninful play time these last 2 games, Pritchard was incredible all year for Boston and actually held up well this series when he did play and his half court shots will be remembered in the legendary playoff run.</p>

<p>Also Hauser really stepped the fuck up these finals after a TERRIBLE postseason run.  His efforts in all 4 wins legitimately were huge&hellip;especially off the ball and all the physical moments like creating or fighting for turnovers.  Then finally his shot was going down.</p>

<p>But man&hellip;seeing old man Al out there just play like a champ one more time and finally getting his ring is so fucking sweet.  Whether he&rsquo;s back or not, this year was so worth it.</p>

<p>Thank God Brad saw what was needed to get over the hump by grabbing Jrue and KP.  GM Brad always knew what coach Brad wanted that Ainge never really pulled the trigger on all these years.  His trading has been instrumental and got us two amazing pieces.</p>

<p>I agree with JB, felt like could have been co-MVPs.  Having the Jays win one and watching them embrace on court together?  Cathartic really. I cried.</p>

<p>I love this team so much.</p>

<p>They just chucked shit on offense and played enough D to wear Dallas down, enabling them to return to Boston with a tired, overconfident Mavericks team that wasn&rsquo;t ready for Boston to play back up to the standard we expect of a finals team. I&rsquo;m not going to say they expect the Mavs to find their shooting again and blow them out so bad, but it looked like they didn&rsquo;t care and their game 3 and game 5 performances cement that.</p>

      <label for="l95m9uc" class="commentText"><p>Gotta be one of the worst and generally least competitive Finals ever. Mavs really brought the worst case scenario of everything to the table. Awful role players that matched up poorly even if their shots were falling. Two stars who looked like volume shooting brick and turnover factories that were utter liabilities on defense.</p>

<p>The worst part is that to me, this Celtics team still hasn&rsquo;t really proven anything. That&rsquo;s not their fault at all, it was purely luck of the draw how things worked out with injuries in the East, and then with potentially tougher matchups falling out of the West. I&rsquo;ve really never seen a team tested so little on the way to a Championship, in any sport.</p>

<p>I understand the Celtics are immaculately put together - courtesy of Brad Stevens - but I just don&rsquo;t get how there can be so little competition. A great hero is only so great for the greatness of the enemy that they overcome. For that reason this season, and these Celtics, will never be remembered as great champions. They didn&rsquo;t even get the opportunity to show otherwise.</p>

      <label for="l95nun5" class="commentText"><p>That is such a stupid perspective to have. The Celtics have gone to the Finals, the ECF game 7, and then won finals over the past three years. They&rsquo;re obviously tested.</p>
