<p>There has, and continues to be, a lot of confusion around Sasha Vezenkov, the former Euroleague MVP who was recently traded to the Toronto Raptors as part of an NBA Draft trade where the Raptors acquired him, Davion Mitchell, a future Blazers 2nd and the 45th pick that became Jamal Shead for Jalen McDaniels.</p>

<p>The general manager of Olympiacos (The team he&rsquo;s reportedly signed with) has stated he is a Toronto Raptor, for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>

<p>Further, you’re thinking of primarily criminal extradition treaties. Sure there may be some civil related treaties but they’re much more limited and unusual.</p>

<p>Also treaties will never overcome jurisdictional issues with personal jurisdiction being a constitutional issue that treaties cannot change.</p>

<p>What exactly is stopping him from signing a contract with another league in another country? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s my understanding that in order to sign with a different league that an NBA player cannot have a contractual obligation with another league before that can sign with the Euroleague, therefore Sasha would need to accept a buyout and forfeit a portion of his NBA salary.  This is part of his NBA contract and <strong>failing to do so would be breaching it</strong>.</p>

<p>This works both ways; Pacome Dadiet recently accepted a buyout from his current team in order for him to be able to sign with the New York Knicks for his rookie contract.</p>

<p>The amount forefeited is important because depending on the amount, it could allow the Raptors to use their MLE and his release would mean a free roster slot for either a trade or to re-sign their UFA Gary Trent Jr. if they choose to bring him back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he leaves the US, what can the Raptors even do? </p>

<p>Uh&hellip;the Raptors are in Toronto, Canada</p>

<p>And we don&rsquo;t talk about the one time they were stuck in the U.S.</p>

      <label for="lbokzyb" class="commentText"><p>That seems like something he could go to court for as an anti-trust violation. Though that would likely take years and it would be easier to get his contract bought out/cancelled by the Raptors with no more money being paid.</p>

      <label for="lbol07a" class="commentText"><p>That would make sense. Thank you for being literally the only person to provide an explanation for how a contract would be enforced between organizations in different countries, rather than just saying he would be in breach of contract.</p>

      <label for="lbol9zv" class="commentText"><p>Uh, the law via a breach of contract?</p>

<p>He would be sued and thus the court would be the &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; in which his obligation is enforced.  If he doesn&rsquo;t hold up his end of the bargain then he&rsquo;d be found in violation and thus he probably wouldn&rsquo;t be getting paid anything by the Raptors or, in the very unlikely chance he&rsquo;s traded, whichever team he is contractually obligated to play for or forfeit to.</p>

      <label for="lboso92" class="commentText"><p>Too many non lawyers here perpetuating incomplete understanding of the law.</p>

<p>It is extremely unlikely for this potential lawsuit for breach of contract to be brought by the raptors or to be enforced against someone who a foreign national living in a foreign country. Such a lawsuit would most likely lack personal jurisdiction whatever US state or district court it would be filed.</p>

Can a team playing in an American sports league sue a player in a European court? If he decides he’s done with the NBA and done with North America, what can anyone do?</p>
