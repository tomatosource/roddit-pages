I was reading a lot more basketball media in 2000 than I do now, and I remember pretty distinctly that the idea was that the Magic wanted Duncan and Hill, with McGrady as the backup if either of those guys didn&rsquo;t want to come.</p>

<p>Look, here&rsquo;s an article from the time:</p>

<p><a href="https://a.espncdn.com/nba/draft00/s/2000/0628/609326.html" target="_blank">https://a.espncdn.com/nba/draft00/s/2000/0628/609326.html</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Freeing the money to be in a position to pursue two stars, instead of one, has been a year-long process.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two. Not three.</p>

<p>But in this article, <a href="https://archive.ph/trKCd" target="_blank">https://archive.ph/trKCd</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But imagine what happens of Duncan had come. Then Magic general manager John Gabriel and his assistant Scott Herring had done their due diligence financially. They had 14 players with one-year contracts, giving them enough flexibility for three max contracts in what would have been the original incarnation of the Big Three in NBA history.</p>

<p>Orlando dared to dream big, making T-shirts with the likenesses of Duncan and Hill wearing Magic jerseys with the tagline “Imagine…” The sales pitch was easy: “Come on down guys, and let’s build a dominant franchise for the next decade.”</p>

<p>“We knew what it was like to live sparsely,” Gabriel said Tuesday. “We crunched the numbers, and we could come up with all three.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this one, <a href="https://orlandomagicdaily.com/2020/05/19/doc-rivers-tries-set-record-straight-orlando-magics-tim-duncan-miss/" target="_blank">https://orlandomagicdaily.com/2020/05/19/doc-rivers-tries-set-record-straight-orlando-magics-tim-duncan-miss/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three Hall-of-Fame players in Grant Hill, Tim Duncan and Tracy McGrady all considered Orlando as viable landing spots in their first free-agent forays. And the Magic had plans to land all three.</p>

<p>They put out the red carpet for all three. They had banners inside the practice facility at RDV Sportsplex with all three wearing Magic jerseys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like the Magic GM thought they would be able to fit all 3 financially.</p>
