      <label for="lmh1b9j" class="commentText"><p>Footwork and passing ability. Shaq could literally do it all from the low block, and before he got up over 330-350lbs he could also push the floor and drive on breaks at will.</p>

<p>Forget the backboard shattering and ripping the basket off the stanchion, some of his scariest highlights IMO are those early LA or Magic days when he’d take the rebound off the glass and push the fast break like a guard, people say Lebron is an agile freight train barreling down the floor, but honestly I would rather try to stop Lebron over physical prime Shaq on the break. Shaq was moving like Miami Bron but even freaking bigger.</p>

Jokic is definitely gonna get his, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but he&rsquo;s also gonna get absolutely bullied everything Shaq is on offense and he probably fouls out pretty early</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aF1TQyHliNo?si=yb_Gn_voITGcRok7" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/aF1TQyHliNo?si=yb_Gn_voITGcRok7</a></p>

<p>They go on about how destructive Shaq was, and not just on offense but defense, the latter of which he’s often dismissed in.</p>

<p>Keep in mind who these two guys are - two of the GOAT slashers, and one is probably the greatest dunker ever, period.  They were afraid of going at Shaq at the rim because he was a very large, physically intimidating presence, which probably kept him from a good amount of blocks too cause nobody is trying to really go at him except Allen Iverson.</p>

<p>Also T-Mac notes that trying to block or just contest Shaq on the other end was scary because he could break your arm or wrist on a dunk.</p>

      <label for="lmgl34j" class="commentText"><p>Yes and no, the game changed so much that Shaq doesn&rsquo;t even have a good comparison today. Maybe back to the basket he is much much more skilled that anyone not named jokic right now. He&rsquo;s also much stronger than Giannis so he will probably break records around the basket. Close to the basket with a defender on his back he has more moves than Zion, but his layup package face to the basket in motion is much worse. It would be very interesting because his playstyle is just so different than anything we have right now. He&rsquo;s a very good passer, better than Giannis back to the basket but much worse in most other areas as a creator. A young Shaq could handle the ball moderately well for his time, idk how it would translate in today&rsquo;s era tho. I think he could learn to do moving screen and becomes an absolute monster screener for his shooters too.</p>

<p>Defense will be a problem tho, I don&rsquo;t expect him to finish close games. Shouldn&rsquo;t matter much anyway tbh</p>

      <label for="lmh15dc" class="commentText"><p>This whole thread feels like I&rsquo;m taking crazy pills&hellip;Shaq was really really good (probably best ever) at a few things which allowed him to dominate but what is this deep bag we&rsquo;re speaking of?</p>

<p>The reason Shaq believes he&rsquo;d be dominant this era is because of the lack of size and physicality compared to his era, but that comes with playing in a more finesse offense where he&rsquo;d have to become a better shooter and playmaker. He&rsquo;d also be gassed on defense unless he got in much better shape given the pace of offense these days. He&rsquo;s an all-time great so of course he&rsquo;d still be excellent today, but it&rsquo;s pointless to compare across eras and play the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; game.</p>

We really saying Shaq would be what 35/15/10 on 65%+ from the field? Especially if he doesn&rsquo;t have a 3 ball?  What exactly would that even look like 30+ postups a game, each about 15 seconds, he would be playing 40 min a night. I&rsquo;m sorry but no.  He would not be &ldquo;much&rdquo; better than Giannis, he would have roughly comparable stats, probably higher fg% and slightly higher scoring.</p>

      <label for="lmgxp4h" class="commentText"><p>Lol no, Shaq as a prospect does not rise to level of “no question” taking him over LeBron. That’s not to take away from Shaq, and there is a good argument to take him over anyone, including LeBron. But implying there’s no debate for a 6’9” playmaker wing with unheard of athleticism, professionalism, and composure at 18 years old to be taken over anyone is just silly. Shaq was a known jock asshole obsessed with money and with very little winning pedigree, LeBron was a known media prodigy with elite teammate + elite first option + absolute winner written all over him. The peripherals dramatically favor LeBron over Shaq.</p>

But he&rsquo;s reasonably smart with good hands and positioning, plays decent team defense and is an elite rebounder. I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s an average defender.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s actually better than expected against the PnR, and the way Denver&rsquo;s defense adjusts around him with Jokic hedging against a switch and switching out is nice to see.</p>

<p>But yes, put Prime Steph and that team&rsquo;s spacing/system against him, Jokic gets cooked. Like most centers in the history of the NBA outside of Russell, Hakeem, Garnett &hellip;</p>

His main weakness is his lack of rim protection/verticality which are definitely really big weaknesses as a center defensively but he does have good positioning to stop plays and pnrs before it gets to the rim a lot of the time. He doesn&rsquo;t overexert himself for the majority of the games since he has to do everything offensively, and he cant rack up fouls early but his defense in the clutch when those things don&rsquo;t matter are pretty solid.</p>

<p> The game where Mann scored 38 Utah couldn’t take advantage of that small lineup on the offensive due to Rudy’s lack of offense on the block and his teammates not being confident with him having the ball on the block. You don’t worry about that with Shaq.   </p>

<p>Even if you replaced rookie Shaq with Gobert solely that game Mann could probably still ring off 38 points. The Clippers would’ve gotten blown out instead of Utah blowing that huge lead.</p>

Giannis is a primary ball handler and an all-time elite two way player that is great on perimeter and post defense.</p>

<p>Shaq is &hellip;. none of those things. Shaq never got the ball at the top of the key and ran the offense lmfao. He was a decent defender for his position because of his size, but not even close to DPOY level. Shaq was a guy that would run to the paint, get in good position, get the ball passed to him, and then dominate. But he played nothing like Giannis.</p>

<p>Shaq would be unbelievable today on offense, no doubt, because of his singularly dominant post offense. He&rsquo;d collapse defenses inwards and force teams to have multiple bigs in their lineup just to guard him (and for fouls). He had phenomenal footwork and touch in the paint, and would be better than Jokic in the post. But he&rsquo;d still be atrocious at the FT line, which would still be a big weakness.</p>

<p>But Shaq would get massacred on defense by all the switches. Most guards would absolutely cook him on the perimeter. Probably a lot of the wings too.</p>

      <label for="lmgkdib" class="commentText"><p>Embiid does get cooked on switches lol &hellip;</p>

<p>Wemby, it&rsquo;s too early to tell. But his length and quickness so far help him adjust. But he&rsquo;s still gonna get cooked by fast guards. And frankly, Wemby already looks like an dominant defensive talent as a rookie. He&rsquo;s special.</p>

<p>Outside of like &hellip;. Bam and AD (maybe Wemby), most bigs today get cooked by quick guards. The difference is how does the team adjust, and how does said cooked player rotate and help the helpers behind him when the ball starts moving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I was so critical of Luka in the Finals; he got blown by like 70% of the time (which is fine), but then he&rsquo;d just stand around watching the team behind him rotate instead of running to the other side and contesting shots.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m saying Shaq wouldn&rsquo;t play like Giannis &hellip;. because Giannis does not get cooked on defense &hellip;. because the post is about Shaq comparing himself to Giannis if he played today&hellip;.</p>

<p>You have a lot of teams that run 4 shooters at all times now (some teams like Boston do 5). There&rsquo;s a lot more ball movement, way more switching, offenses are a lot more complicated, etc&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lmgigw1" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is definitely a better defender than Shaq, but somehow the idea that Shaq was a terrible defender has taken off on this sub, and that’s just not true. He was an average defender because he was lazy on defense a lot of the time, and the frustration came from the fact that his defensive potential was crazy. </p>

<p>E.g. a fit Shaq definitely wouldn’t get “dog walked” by anyone because he had fantastic quickness, footwork and coordination for his size. </p>

<p>But anyway it doesn’t matter too much because he’d be “dogwalking” every one of those bigs like crazy while on offense and scoring at a much higher percentage. </p>

      <label for="lmgj19a" class="commentText"><p>We can&rsquo;t really compare, though, because he&rsquo;d be a different player in this era. Young Shaq would absolutely be athletic enough to hang with the shooting bigs of today. However, he played in a league where his overpowering size was more of an asset than his versatility.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s hard to compare different eras. Shaq growing up 20 years later would simply be a different player. You don&rsquo;t just pick up a guy who grew up in the 70s and 80s and plop him into 2024. Same as of you dropped KAT into the 70s and 80s, he wouldn&rsquo;t have grown up as a shooting big.</p>

      <label for="lmgjr98" class="commentText"><p>I mean, he&rsquo;s the one who is comparing tho, and we are just responding.</p>

<p>I agree it&rsquo;s tough to compare eras, but a big with his skill set would be a pretty notable liability in the modern NBA, since he was not an elite defender, and he was a horrid shooter. You would likely have to play a 2nd defensive big with him, and that guy has to be a good shooter now, bc Shaq provides 0 spacing.</p>

<p>But yes, if he grew up in this era, his game would likely be very different, and he likely would have spent time to develop at least a basic level shooting, like AD.</p>

<p>Ah, here we go. Guess it&rsquo;s time to teach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shaq was repeatedly on the all-defense team</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If by &ldquo;repeatedly&rdquo;, you mean 3x over 19 years, sure. Also he was never on the All-Defensive 1st team. Giannis was named to the All-Defensive 1st team 4x, more times than Shaq was named to any All-Defense team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>was a runner up for DPOY at least once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shaq was indeed the runner-up once, and it was the only time in his entire career he was in the top 7 for DPOY. Giannis won DPOY in 2020, and finished in the top 6 five times. Consecutively. He has not finished outside of the top 9 for DPOY since he was 24, in 2019.</p>

      <label for="lmgkvwy" class="commentText"><p>While both Lakers and Orlando versions of Shaq (basically 1992-2004) would dominate the league today, I think the Orlando version would have transferred much better to the league today.</p>

<p>Yes, prime Shaq would be unstoppable at 350lbs with freakish athleticism, but he would struggle mightily against most guards and wings in the current NBA. Guys are just more skilled and better shooters than they’ve ever been.</p>

<p>However, Shaq from 1992-1997 is a different story. Still 300-330lbs, 1-of-1 athlete, could outrun most modern bigs down the court, great endurance. However, it would be his agility on the perimeter on defense that separates it for me.</p>

<p>Would easily be the best player in the league and would need to be triple teamed on a nightly basis.</p>

      <label for="lmgobki" class="commentText"><p>Difference is, during Peak Shaq era him being a 50% FT shooter still meant that in a time where half court offenses were inefficient compared to today, Shaq making only one free throw (equal to 1 PPP) meant it was a notably efficient possession relative to the most possessions of that era. You just fouled him because that was better than him putting up an easy two points.</p>

<p>Today, with half court offenses becoming more efficient and faster paced, the poor free throw shooting actually does become a problem for the team’s scoring efficiency in the half court.</p>

<p>That said Shaq would still be a monster in today’s league.</p>

Yes, the game is played differently but that doesn’t mean that someone like him with the proper training couldn’t adapt. The guy was an incredible athlete, his post footwork is second to none considering in his prime he was 350 - 375 lbs, plus there was no one who could really stop him from scoring.</p>

<p>Cross era comparisons like this one are difficult because there is no one that I can think of that is truly comparable to Shaq. Giannis might be the closest in his mind because of his aggressive physicality in the paint, but I think that’s about as close as they come as far as comparisons go.</p>

      <label for="lmgm0th" class="commentText"><p>Shaq would dominate any era. Some players just transcend eras. No one argues about greatness of the top 50-60 players even when eras are discussed. Bill Russell would still be great today, look at draymond he&rsquo;s basically that minus the height. Curry would still be great then, look at Jerry west.</p>

<p>For the top players it&rsquo;s mostly the luck of great physical gifts, will power and killer mentality, that has made them. That worked 1000s years back, works today and will work till 11th November 2032 when we&rsquo;ll all die from the asteroid hitting us.</p>

      <label for="lmgphhs" class="commentText"><p>It’s an interesting thought exercise for someone who watched him evolve.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Skinny Orlando Shaq was a much better, much more dominant form of peak Dwight Howard - ran the court, agile, unstoppable anywhere near the paint. I think that era’s Shaq has a place today, with a caveat about his shooting ability.</p></li>

<li><p>Fat Shaq was possibly the most unstoppable physical force in the game ever, but at that point he was reliant on loose offensive foul calls and flop culture not yet having been pioneered. I have memories of him bashing large post defenders into the shadow realm.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>His biggest limitation in either form is that I don’t think he had even the shooting ability of Giannis. With his inability to develop any basic consistency at the foul line in the face of hack a Shaq motivation, I question whether coaching or more focus would have helped him develop.</p>
