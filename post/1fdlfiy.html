      <label for="lmgvlen" class="commentText"><p>This reminds me of this interview T-Mac and Vince gave about Shaq:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aF1TQyHliNo?si=yb_Gn_voITGcRok7" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/aF1TQyHliNo?si=yb_Gn_voITGcRok7</a></p>

<p>They go on about how destructive Shaq was, and not just on offense but defense, the latter of which he’s often dismissed in.</p>

<p>Keep in mind who these two guys are - two of the GOAT slashers, and one is probably the greatest dunker ever, period.  They were afraid of going at Shaq at the rim because he was a very large, physically intimidating presence, which probably kept him from a good amount of blocks too cause nobody is trying to really go at him except Allen Iverson.</p>

<p>Also T-Mac notes that trying to block or just contest Shaq on the other end was scary because he could break your arm or wrist on a dunk.</p>

      <label for="lmgl34j" class="commentText"><p>Yes and no, the game changed so much that Shaq doesn&rsquo;t even have a good comparison today. Maybe back to the basket he is much much more skilled that anyone not named jokic right now. He&rsquo;s also much stronger than Giannis so he will probably break records around the basket. Close to the basket with a defender on his back he has more moves than Zion, but his layup package face to the basket in motion is much worse. It would be very interesting because his playstyle is just so different than anything we have right now. He&rsquo;s a very good passer, better than Giannis back to the basket but much worse in most other areas as a creator. A young Shaq could handle the ball moderately well for his time, idk how it would translate in today&rsquo;s era tho. I think he could learn to do moving screen and becomes an absolute monster screener for his shooters too.</p>

<p>Defense will be a problem tho, I don&rsquo;t expect him to finish close games. Shouldn&rsquo;t matter much anyway tbh</p>

He’d get called for so many offensive fouls for running people over and throwing elbows that he’d be on the bench in the first quarter with foul trouble if he played the same way.</p>

<p>That said, he has the agility and quickness to still be generational and incredible. His most unstoppable attribute (sheer physical brute strength) just wouldn’t be able to be fully utilized as it would have been allowed in the 90s/early 2000s.</p>

But he&rsquo;s reasonably smart with good hands and positioning, plays decent team defense and is an elite rebounder. I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s an average defender.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s actually better than expected against the PnR, and the way Denver&rsquo;s defense adjusts around him with Jokic hedging against a switch and switching out is nice to see.</p>

<p>But yes, put Prime Steph and that team&rsquo;s spacing/system against him, Jokic gets cooked. Like most centers in the history of the NBA outside of Russell, Hakeem, Garnett &hellip;</p>

      <label for="lmgi3s0" class="commentText"><p>Shaq comparing himself to Giannis was always silly to me; he&rsquo;s just hyping himself up as if he played anything like Giannis &hellip;. Giannis is a primary ball handler and an all-time elite two way player that is great on perimeter and post defense.</p>

<p>Shaq is &hellip;. none of those things. Shaq never got the ball at the top of the key and ran the offense lmfao. He was a decent defender for his position because of his size, but not even close to DPOY level. Shaq was a guy that would run to the paint, get in good position, get the ball passed to him, and then dominate. But he played nothing like Giannis.</p>

<p>Shaq would be unbelievable today on offense, no doubt, because of his singularly dominant post offense. He&rsquo;d collapse defenses inwards and force teams to have multiple bigs in their lineup just to guard him (and for fouls). He had phenomenal footwork and touch in the paint, and would be better than Jokic in the post. But he&rsquo;d still be atrocious at the FT line, which would still be a big weakness.</p>

<p>But Shaq would get massacred on defense by all the switches. Most guards would absolutely cook him on the perimeter. Probably a lot of the wings too.</p>

<p>Wemby, it&rsquo;s too early to tell. But his length and quickness so far help him adjust. But he&rsquo;s still gonna get cooked by fast guards. And frankly, Wemby already looks like an dominant defensive talent as a rookie. He&rsquo;s special.</p>

<p>Outside of like &hellip;. Bam and AD (maybe Wemby), most bigs today get cooked by quick guards. The difference is how does the team adjust, and how does said cooked player rotate and help the helpers behind him when the ball starts moving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I was so critical of Luka in the Finals; he got blown by like 70% of the time (which is fine), but then he&rsquo;d just stand around watching the team behind him rotate instead of running to the other side and contesting shots.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying he wouldn&rsquo;t play like Giannis at all.</p>

<p>Prime Shaq would still be a top 3 player today with Jokic and Giannis, imo.</p>

<p>But not because he played like Giannis. But because he was one of the most singularly dominant post offensive players in history.</p>

<p>Embiid, while being a big man doesn&rsquo;t play at all like Shaq did. He plays face up like a guard and shoots almost 90% on FTs. Even though he might be the closest comparison in today&rsquo;s NBA he&rsquo;s just really not a good one.</p>

<p>The Giannis comparison is a clumsy one only because there is no one like Shaq, but he and Zion are probably the closest thing because of their high-percentage work in the paint, from 0-3 feet, much of which involves dunks or shots at that distance otherwise.</p>

<p>That’s literally all. The comparison has holes in it only because <em>there is nobody like Shaq.</em> He’s a player who we struggle to analogize, because he is unique, and Giannis probably comes the closest even if it’s a very rough comparison.</p>

<p>Your astute, NASA-like argument here is that Shaq never brought the ball up from the perimeter, so it’s a bad comparison.</p>

<p>Brilliant.</p>

<p>With zone defense being allowed and 3p shooting being so much more important he&rsquo;d be a completely different player today than he was back then. Drop 96 or 2001 Shaq today and he&rsquo;d get killed on defense but feast on offense. But if Shaq was allowed to grow up in this era and adapt, he&rsquo;d be great of course.</p>

<p>Agreed. Most all-time greats from the past would dominate in this era if they&rsquo;d grown up in this era and adjusted to today&rsquo;s playstyle.</p>

      <label for="lmgpqi3" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. Orlando Shaq ran fast breaks, he was lean, fast, and unstoppable on a break, much like Giannis. Had good coordination and could dribble.</p>

<p>Somehow you acknowledge less shooters and spacing when he played while talking about his defence, and yet miss the point that centers just didn&rsquo;t slash often in half court due to the exact same spacing issue.</p>

<p>And Shaq had great vision, passed out of double teams often and on point. I really don&rsquo;t get where you got this idea that he just bullied and dunked on people. He obviously did that, but it&rsquo;s a ridiculous take to say he was a one trick pony.
Man had hooks, spins, elite footwork, dreamshakes, pass vision, great positioning, had PnR game, post dribble, live dribble, fastbreaks, rebounding. He was the main defensive focus of the team, they doubled him off the ball, denied entry passes, they threw everything at the guy and he usually ate everyone alive.</p>

<p>Giannis will score if you don&rsquo;t scheme for him. But he has issues in halfcourt against set defenders when he&rsquo;s the main ball handler. There was a lot of talk about him learning to operate in the post so that he can be more effective in those situations, much like Jokic or Luka.
Orlando Shaq can do both transition offense initiation and top tier post shop setup from day one.</p>

<p>You think Shaq passing out of constant doubles, either on half court initiation or post play to open elite shooters wouldn&rsquo;t be an efficient NBA offense? There&rsquo;s no way you saw this man play basketball. It&rsquo;s just hating for no reason.</p>

<p>As for his defense, he was a good rim protector, he would for sure have to stay leaner to at least have an honest go at defending after switches. Usually you drop huge 5s and help comes in from other defenders, so I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that big of a deal. He had 7&rsquo;7&rdquo; wingspan on his huge frame. He&rsquo;s gonna be fine lol.</p>

He was an average defender because he was lazy on defense a lot of the time, and the frustration came from the fact that his defensive potential was crazy. </p>

<p>E.g. a fit Shaq definitely wouldn’t get “dog walked” by anyone because he had fantastic quickness, footwork and coordination for his size. </p>

<p>But anyway it doesn’t matter too much because he’d be “dogwalking” every one of those bigs like crazy while on offense and scoring at a much higher percentage. </p>

Young Shaq would absolutely be athletic enough to hang with the shooting bigs of today. However, he played in a league where his overpowering size was more of an asset than his versatility.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s hard to compare different eras. Shaq growing up 20 years later would simply be a different player. You don&rsquo;t just pick up a guy who grew up in the 70s and 80s and plop him into 2024. Same as of you dropped KAT into the 70s and 80s, he wouldn&rsquo;t have grown up as a shooting big.</p>

<p>I agree it&rsquo;s tough to compare eras, but a big with his skill set would be a pretty notable liability in the modern NBA, since he was not an elite defender, and he was a horrid shooter. You would likely have to play a 2nd defensive big with him, and that guy has to be a good shooter now, bc Shaq provides 0 spacing.</p>

<p>But yes, if he grew up in this era, his game would likely be very different, and he likely would have spent time to develop at least a basic level shooting, like AD.</p>

<p>If by &ldquo;repeatedly&rdquo;, you mean 3x over 19 years, sure. Also he was never on the All-Defensive 1st team. Giannis was named to the All-Defensive 1st team 4x, more times than Shaq was named to any All-Defense team.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Shaq was indeed the runner-up once, and it was the only time in his entire career he was in the top 7 for DPOY. Giannis won DPOY in 2020, and finished in the top 6 five times. Consecutively. He has not finished outside of the top 9 for DPOY since he was 24, in 2019.</p>

      <label for="lmgobki" class="commentText"><p>Difference is, during Peak Shaq era him being a 50% FT shooter still meant that in a time where half court offenses were inefficient compared to today, Shaq making only one free throw (equal to 1 PPP) meant it was a notably efficient possession relative to the most possessions of that era. You just fouled him because that was better than him putting up an easy two points.</p>

<p>Today, with half court offenses becoming more efficient and faster paced, the poor free throw shooting actually does become a problem for the team’s scoring efficiency in the half court.</p>

<p>That said Shaq would still be a monster in today’s league.</p>

      <label for="lmgkvwy" class="commentText"><p>While both Lakers and Orlando versions of Shaq (basically 1992-2004) would dominate the league today, I think the Orlando version would have transferred much better to the league today.</p>

<p>Yes, prime Shaq would be unstoppable at 350lbs with freakish athleticism, but he would struggle mightily against most guards and wings in the current NBA. Guys are just more skilled and better shooters than they’ve ever been.</p>

<p>However, Shaq from 1992-1997 is a different story. Still 300-330lbs, 1-of-1 athlete, could outrun most modern bigs down the court, great endurance. However, it would be his agility on the perimeter on defense that separates it for me.</p>

<p>Would easily be the best player in the league and would need to be triple teamed on a nightly basis.</p>

Jokic would probably have caused a lot of problems for Orlando Shaq.</p>

<p>Can’t overstate the impact of Phil Jackson and Kurt Rambis unlocking that final level of Shaqness that made him nearly impossible to score on, it helped the Lakers make multiple playoff comebacks, that defense created big scoring runs</p>

      <label for="lmgql0h" class="commentText"><p>Anyone in this thread who thinks Shaq couldn’t play in this era should really watch his career highlights. Yes, the game is played differently but that doesn’t mean that someone like him with the proper training couldn’t adapt. The guy was an incredible athlete, his post footwork is second to none considering in his prime he was 350 - 375 lbs, plus there was no one who could really stop him from scoring.</p>

<p>Cross era comparisons like this one are difficult because there is no one that I can think of that is truly comparable to Shaq. Giannis might be the closest in his mind because of his aggressive physicality in the paint, but I think that’s about as close as they come as far as comparisons go.</p>

Bill Russell would still be great today, look at draymond he&rsquo;s basically that minus the height. Curry would still be great then, look at Jerry west.</p>

<p>For the top players it&rsquo;s mostly the luck of great physical gifts, will power and killer mentality, that has made them. That worked 1000s years back, works today and will work till 11th November 2032 when we&rsquo;ll all die from the asteroid hitting us.</p>

      <label for="lmgphhs" class="commentText"><p>It’s an interesting thought exercise for someone who watched him evolve.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Skinny Orlando Shaq was a much better, much more dominant form of peak Dwight Howard - ran the court, agile, unstoppable anywhere near the paint. I think that era’s Shaq has a place today, with a caveat about his shooting ability.</p></li>

<li><p>Fat Shaq was possibly the most unstoppable physical force in the game ever, but at that point he was reliant on loose offensive foul calls and flop culture not yet having been pioneered. I have memories of him bashing large post defenders into the shadow realm.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>His biggest limitation in either form is that I don’t think he had even the shooting ability of Giannis. With his inability to develop any basic consistency at the foul line in the face of hack a Shaq motivation, I question whether coaching or more focus would have helped him develop.</p>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t even taking into account his on-court gravity. I honestly believe we would&rsquo;ve seen small-ball line-ups way sooner if every playoff team in the late 90&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t have to keep a big in the rotation to waste 6 fouls on Shaq. I haven&rsquo;t seen another player command the kind of respect Shaq did just by being out there. Curry is the closest.</p>

      <label for="lmgv5vz" class="commentText"><p>Shaq in his earlier days would have wreaked havoc on the league today. His combination of size/strength/athleticism would been a matchup nightmare while not leaving him exposed.</p>

<p>But as he aged and got fat, I actually think he would have struggled way more in this era than in his era. By the time he got into his 30s, his mobility was pretty limited because he was so damn heavy. He largely just camped out near the basket on both ends. In today’s game, the pace, spacing, and schematic complexity is significantly more challenging to navigate for big men.  It wouldn’t have quite been Enes Kanter “can’t play him” levels, but he would have STRUGGLED to guard a Luka/Gafford pick and roll or handling a hard hedge  against the Warriors.</p>

There&rsquo;s a reason why you see so few back to the basket players in todays NBA. Teams have so much more freedom in the way they can defend. Teams can send double teams from all over, they can overload the floor to one side, there are more ways to defend players like Shaq today. He would need to develop a face the basket game and a respectable jump shot to dominate in the NBA the same way he did in the 90&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Not saying he wouldn&rsquo;t be great in any era but he was built and trained for the era he played in.</p>
