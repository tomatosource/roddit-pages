      <label for="lmgl34j" class="commentText"><p>Yes and no, the game changed so much that Shaq doesn&rsquo;t even have a good comparison today. Maybe back to the basket he is much much more skilled that anyone not named jokic right now. He&rsquo;s also much stronger than Giannis so he will probably break records around the basket. Close to the basket with a defender on his back he has more moves than Zion, but his layup package face to the basket in motion is much worse. It would be very interesting because his playstyle is just so different than anything we have right now. He&rsquo;s a very good passer, better than Giannis back to the basket but much worse in most other areas as a creator. A young Shaq could handle the ball moderately well for his time, idk how it would translate in today&rsquo;s era tho. I think he could learn to do moving screen and becomes an absolute monster screener for his shooters too.</p>

<p>Defense will be a problem tho, I don&rsquo;t expect him to finish close games. Shouldn&rsquo;t matter much anyway tbh</p>

Guys would be flopping left &amp; right and I think he might put up worse offensive foul #s than Giannis. They allow a fair amount of contact these days (Giannis can truck people) but in the 2000s it was a damn wrestling match under the rim and nobody stood a chance in he&rsquo;ll. He&rsquo;d also have to stick with the Orlando weight just to avoid being a catastrophe on defense.</p>

<p>I imagine he&rsquo;d be like a pokemon fusion combo of Giannis &amp; Embiid. He might shoot 90% at the rim 🤣</p>

      <label for="lmgi3s0" class="commentText"><p>Shaq comparing himself to Giannis was always silly to me; he&rsquo;s just hyping himself up as if he played anything like Giannis &hellip;. Giannis is a primary ball handler and an all-time elite two way player that is great on perimeter and post defense.</p>

<p>Shaq is &hellip;. none of those things. Shaq never got the ball at the top of the key and ran the offense lmfao. He was a decent defender for his position because of his size, but not even close to DPOY level. Shaq was a guy that would run to the paint, get in good position, get the ball passed to him, and then dominate. But he played nothing like Giannis.</p>

<p>Shaq would be unbelievable today on offense, no doubt, because of his singularly dominant post offense. He&rsquo;d collapse defenses inwards and force teams to have multiple bigs in their lineup just to guard him (and for fouls). He had phenomenal footwork and touch in the paint, and would be better than Jokic in the post. But he&rsquo;d still be atrocious at the FT line, which would still be a big weakness.</p>

<p>But Shaq would get massacred on defense by all the switches. Most guards would absolutely cook him on the perimeter. Probably a lot of the wings too.</p>

      <label for="lmgjazh" class="commentText"><p>His offensive skillset as a scorer? Yes, Shaq as a scorer in his prime was outrageous. Giannis isn&rsquo;t that far behind imo though; he&rsquo;s a dominant scorer in his own right.</p>

<p>Overall offensive skillset with the ball? Absolutely not. Giannis is leagues ahead as a playmaker and ballhandler.</p>

<p>Shaq was just a 1 trick pony. Thing is, his 1 trick was overwhelmingly dominant that it forced teams to adjust to him (and he&rsquo;d still wreck them).</p>

<p>You have a lot of teams that run 4 shooters at all times now (some teams like Boston do 5). There&rsquo;s a lot more ball movement, way more switching, offenses are a lot more complicated, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a totally different game 20 years later.</p>

      <label for="lmgkdib" class="commentText"><p>Embiid does get cooked on switches lol &hellip;</p>

<p>Wemby, it&rsquo;s too early to tell. But his length and quickness so far help him adjust. But he&rsquo;s still gonna get cooked by fast guards. And frankly, Wemby already looks like an dominant defensive talent as a rookie. He&rsquo;s special.</p>

<p>Outside of like &hellip;. Bam and AD (maybe Wemby), most bigs today get cooked by quick guards. The difference is how does the team adjust, and how does said cooked player rotate and help the helpers behind him when the ball starts moving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I was so critical of Luka in the Finals; he got blown by like 70% of the time (which is fine), but then he&rsquo;d just stand around watching the team behind him rotate instead of running to the other side and contesting shots.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying he wouldn&rsquo;t play like Giannis at all.</p>

<p>Prime Shaq would still be a top 3 player today with Jokic and Giannis, imo.</p>

<p>But not because he played like Giannis. But because he was one of the most singularly dominant post offensive players in history.</p>

      <label for="lmgj19a" class="commentText"><p>We can&rsquo;t really compare, though, because he&rsquo;d be a different player in this era. Young Shaq would absolutely be athletic enough to hang with the shooting bigs of today. However, he played in a league where his overpowering size was more of an asset than his versatility.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s hard to compare different eras. Shaq growing up 20 years later would simply be a different player. You don&rsquo;t just pick up a guy who grew up in the 70s and 80s and plop him into 2024. Same as of you dropped KAT into the 70s and 80s, he wouldn&rsquo;t have grown up as a shooting big.</p>

      <label for="lmgjr98" class="commentText"><p>I mean, he&rsquo;s the one who is comparing tho, and we are just responding.</p>

<p>I agree it&rsquo;s tough to compare eras, but a big with his skill set would be a pretty notable liability in the modern NBA, since he was not an elite defender, and he was a horrid shooter. You would likely have to play a 2nd defensive big with him, and that guy has to be a good shooter now, bc Shaq provides 0 spacing.</p>

<p>But yes, if he grew up in this era, his game would likely be very different, and he likely would have spent time to develop at least a basic level shooting, like AD.</p>

      <label for="lmgigw1" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is definitely a better defender than Shaq, but somehow the idea that Shaq was a terrible defender has taken off on this sub, and that’s just not true. He was an average defender because he was lazy on defense a lot of the time, and the frustration came from the fact that his defensive potential was crazy. </p>

<p>E.g. a fit Shaq definitely wouldn’t get “dog walked” by anyone because he had fantastic quickness, footwork and coordination for his size. </p>

<p>But anyway it doesn’t matter too much because he’d be “dogwalking” every one of those bigs like crazy while on offense and scoring at a much higher percentage. </p>

Shaq finished top 6 once, and never won it. And effort is a big part of defense, so him being lazy does effect that.</p>

      <label for="lmgkvwy" class="commentText"><p>While both Lakers and Orlando versions of Shaq (basically 1992-2004) would dominate the league today, I think the Orlando version would have transferred much better to the league today.</p>

<p>Yes, prime Shaq would be unstoppable at 350lbs with freakish athleticism, but he would struggle mightily against most guards and wings in the current NBA. Guys are just more skilled and better shooters than they’ve ever been.</p>

<p>However, Shaq from 1992-1997 is a different story. Still 300-330lbs, 1-of-1 athlete, could outrun most modern bigs down the court, great endurance. However, it would be his agility on the perimeter on defense that separates it for me.</p>

<p>Would easily be the best player in the league and would need to be triple teamed on a nightly basis.</p>

      <label for="lmgm0th" class="commentText"><p>Shaq would dominate any era. Some players just transcend eras. No one argues about greatness of the top 50-60 players even when eras are discussed. Bill Russell would still be great today, look at draymond he&rsquo;s basically that minus the height. Curry would still be great then, look at Jerry west.</p>

<p>For the top players it&rsquo;s mostly the luck of great physical gifts, will power and killer mentality, that has made them. That worked 1000s years back, works today and will work till 11th November 2032 when we&rsquo;ll all die from the asteroid hitting us.</p>
