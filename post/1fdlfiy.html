<p>Going 5 out with Shaq essentially means giving up 80% field goal % on the defensive end. Can an efficient 3-pt shooting team counter balance that? I doubt it.</p>

<p>The reason Rudy is abused is because he is not that helpful offensively</p>

<p>Also, any version of Shaq would massacre teams on the offensive end and there would be no answer for him. Teams would still have to adapt to him. And with how the game is called now, the players guarding him will end up in foul trouble. You can put shooters on the floor but they won’t be out there for too long.</p>

      <label for="lmhr579" class="commentText"><p>One wrinkle here is that in Shaq&rsquo;s day, illegal defense rules limited how defenses could operate. The abolishment of the illegal defense rules are one major contributor to why the archetype of the big man operating in the low post has almost vanished from the NBA despite being the most prolifically dominant archetype throughout NBA history.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Shaq would absolutely dominate in today&rsquo;s game. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be quite as straightforward or as easy as it might appear at first, since teams would be playing lots of hedging / clogging type defenses that would limit his space to operate in the post even before catching the ball. Of course, that would open up things for his teammates, etc. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be quite as simple as &ldquo;Shaq destroyed David Robinson, just imagine what he&rsquo;d do to Al Horford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which we can see that Shaq&hellip; seemingly had little to no impact from the rules in his stats in the two following years of the rule change. He only physically fell off in the 2002-03 season with injuries and physical decline.</p>

      <label for="lmi7b05" class="commentText"><p>The issue with this partially is Shaq&rsquo;s mentality. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid to give you an elbow in the post to get you to give him some space if you think the gameplan is going to be to crowd him and try to deny. He&rsquo;d have to tone it down in the modern day with reviews and the easier flagrant, but he&rsquo;s still smart enough to find his spots. Majority of the defenders in the league are not taking multiple elbows or shoulders through the chest from Shaq and continuing to play that way. Giannis does a lot of the same things already, now.</p>

      <label for="lmh9ykh" class="commentText"><p>Definitely. Difference is though Shaq would be able to hold his own on the offensive end.      </p>

<p> The game where Mann scored 38 Utah couldn’t take advantage of that small lineup on the offensive due to Rudy’s lack of offense on the block and his teammates not being confident with him having the ball on the block. You don’t worry about that with Shaq.   </p>

<p>Even if you replaced rookie Shaq with Gobert solely that game Mann could probably still ring off 38 points. The Clippers would’ve gotten blown out instead of Utah blowing that huge lead.</p>

<p>The only reason that worked so well against Rudy is because he didn’t have the offensive skill, touch or physicality to punish smaller defenders on the other end. Shaq would literally drop 50-60+ every game if you put a bunch of little dudes out there lol.</p>

Go 5 out vs Shaq and you just fouled out your starting center at half time or let Shaq torch you for 30 on insane efficiency. You&rsquo;d need guys like Marc Gasol or Nazr Mohammed who have the size to at least stand with Shaq and the shot to stretch the defense. Really hard to find true 5s with good 3s.</p>

<p>That only works if you can reasonably defend Gobert with a Terrance Mann. Putting Mann on Shaq just ends with you having to pick bits of Terrance out of the net.</p>

      <label for="lmgsjc7" class="commentText"><p>Eh, Jokic isn&rsquo;t a terrible defender. He&rsquo;s just slow and has no verticality. But he&rsquo;s reasonably smart with good hands and positioning, plays decent team defense and is an elite rebounder. I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s an average defender.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s actually better than expected against the PnR, and the way Denver&rsquo;s defense adjusts around him with Jokic hedging against a switch and switching out is nice to see.</p>

<p>But yes, put Prime Steph and that team&rsquo;s spacing/system against him, Jokic gets cooked. Like most centers in the history of the NBA outside of Russell, Hakeem, Garnett &hellip;</p>

      <label for="lmgy85r" class="commentText"><p>Hes not a a terrible defender though? His main weakness is his lack of rim protection/verticality which are definitely really big weaknesses as a center defensively but he does have good positioning to stop plays and pnrs before it gets to the rim a lot of the time. He doesn&rsquo;t overexert himself for the majority of the games since he has to do everything offensively, and he cant rack up fouls early but his defense in the clutch when those things don&rsquo;t matter are pretty solid.</p>

      <label for="lmh6lun" class="commentText"><p>I actually don’t think he’d get exploited defensively.  You simply could not put a small ball 5 out there against Shaq, as he’d absolutely destroy them, dunks every time.  That’s a big way teams exploit slower centres, but it only works on guys who don’t consistently dominate smaller centres in the post, and Shaq absolutely does, probably more than any other player in history.</p>

<p>Also Jokic gets by decently enough defensively, and Shaq was IMO a much better defender than Jokic.  Far more athletic, taller/longer/stronger, dramatically better shot blocker and paint protector, and I personally think his foot speed was at least as good as Jokic’s, probably better.  Jokic gets by defensively on smarts/positioning and hands, plus defensive schemes that make up for his weaknesses, like running drop coverage on P&amp;Rs.  Shaq had similar hands and smarts, and teams could run similar drop coverage type schemes with Shaq, with fewer limitations too, as Shaq would be a much, much better paint protector.  I think Shaq would be far better than Jokic in terms of overall defensive impact, somewhere between Jokic and Embiid, but closer to Embiid.</p>

<p>People forget that Shaq, from <sup>1999</sup>&frasl;<sub>00</sub> through <sup>2004</sup>&frasl;<sub>05</sub>, was all-defensive 2nd team 3 times, and top 10 in DPOY voting 4 times (2nd, 8th twice, 10th, and had another season just outside the top 10, at 13th).  He had his weaknesses defensively, but overall he was a very good defensive player then, and still would be today IMO.</p>

<p>Forget the backboard shattering and ripping the basket off the stanchion, some of his scariest highlights IMO are those early LA or Magic days when he’d take the rebound off the glass and push the fast break like a guard, people say Lebron is an agile freight train barreling down the floor, but honestly I would rather try to stop Lebron over physical prime Shaq on the break. Shaq was moving like Miami Bron but even freaking bigger.</p>

<p>They go on about how destructive Shaq was, and not just on offense but defense, the latter of which he’s often dismissed in.</p>

<p>Keep in mind who these two guys are - two of the GOAT slashers, and one is probably the greatest dunker ever, period.  They were afraid of going at Shaq at the rim because he was a very large, physically intimidating presence, which probably kept him from a good amount of blocks too cause nobody is trying to really go at him except Allen Iverson.</p>

<p>Also T-Mac notes that trying to block or just contest Shaq on the other end was scary because he could break your arm or wrist on a dunk.</p>

<p>The reason Shaq believes he&rsquo;d be dominant this era is because of the lack of size and physicality compared to his era, but that comes with playing in a more finesse offense where he&rsquo;d have to become a better shooter and playmaker. He&rsquo;d also be gassed on defense unless he got in much better shape given the pace of offense these days. He&rsquo;s an all-time great so of course he&rsquo;d still be excellent today, but it&rsquo;s pointless to compare across eras and play the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; game.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>How is this upvoted? Idk how you’re defining athletic but giannis is near 7ft and can run high pick and rolls as the ball handler, and routinely leads the nba in transition scoring. Shaq is nowhere near him or Zion as a ball handler, they’re both better passers, better shooters, while also bringing the rim pressure shaq did. These kind of threads always swing to one extreme depending on the title. To claim that shaq was less reliant on his physicality than Zion is just laughably untrue. Zion’s ability to find angles off the glass for layups and his touch around the rim is absurd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they can’t do stuff like his baby hook at near the same level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Shaq can’t lead transitions breaks or pass like them?</p>

      <label for="lmgl34j" class="commentText"><p>Yes and no, the game changed so much that Shaq doesn&rsquo;t even have a good comparison today. Maybe back to the basket he is much much more skilled that anyone not named jokic right now. He&rsquo;s also much stronger than Giannis so he will probably break records around the basket. Close to the basket with a defender on his back he has more moves than Zion, but his layup package face to the basket in motion is much worse. It would be very interesting because his playstyle is just so different than anything we have right now. He&rsquo;s a very good passer, better than Giannis back to the basket but much worse in most other areas as a creator. A young Shaq could handle the ball moderately well for his time, idk how it would translate in today&rsquo;s era tho. I think he could learn to do moving screen and becomes an absolute monster screener for his shooters too.</p>

<p>Defense will be a problem tho, I don&rsquo;t expect him to finish close games. Shouldn&rsquo;t matter much anyway tbh</p>

      <label for="lmhgj0v" class="commentText"><p>Like wtf are talking here.  Giannis was 30/12/7 last year on 60%+ from the field with great defense.  We really saying Shaq would be what 35/15/10 on 65%+ from the field? Especially if he doesn&rsquo;t have a 3 ball?  What exactly would that even look like 30+ postups a game, each about 15 seconds, he would be playing 40 min a night. I&rsquo;m sorry but no.  He would not be &ldquo;much&rdquo; better than Giannis, he would have roughly comparable stats, probably higher fg% and slightly higher scoring.</p>

<p>The way fouls are called, he might also foul out more. He&rsquo;d very possibly draw more fouls, too, but obviously he was a bad free throw shooter so the advantages would be limited by that.</p>

<p>Amazing, top 5 even&hellip;but a dude shooting even worse than Giannis on free throws is kinda a tough sell nowadays with how teams can just go crazy with 3s and make a quick comeback.</p>

<p>Not super common, but very much possible and annoying.</p>

      <label for="lmgi3s0" class="commentText"><p>Shaq comparing himself to Giannis was always silly to me; he&rsquo;s just hyping himself up as if he played anything like Giannis &hellip;. Giannis is a primary ball handler and an all-time elite two way player that is great on perimeter and post defense.</p>

<p>Shaq is &hellip;. none of those things. Shaq never got the ball at the top of the key and ran the offense lmfao. He was a decent defender for his position because of his size, but not even close to DPOY level. Shaq was a guy that would run to the paint, get in good position, get the ball passed to him, and then dominate. But he played nothing like Giannis.</p>

<p>Shaq would be unbelievable today on offense, no doubt, because of his singularly dominant post offense. He&rsquo;d collapse defenses inwards and force teams to have multiple bigs in their lineup just to guard him (and for fouls). He had phenomenal footwork and touch in the paint, and would be better than Jokic in the post. But he&rsquo;d still be atrocious at the FT line, which would still be a big weakness.</p>

<p>But Shaq would get massacred on defense by all the switches. Most guards would absolutely cook him on the perimeter. Probably a lot of the wings too.</p>

<p>Wemby, it&rsquo;s too early to tell. But his length and quickness so far help him adjust. But he&rsquo;s still gonna get cooked by fast guards. And frankly, Wemby already looks like an dominant defensive talent as a rookie. He&rsquo;s special.</p>

<p>Outside of like &hellip;. Bam and AD (maybe Wemby), most bigs today get cooked by quick guards. The difference is how does the team adjust, and how does said cooked player rotate and help the helpers behind him when the ball starts moving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I was so critical of Luka in the Finals; he got blown by like 70% of the time (which is fine), but then he&rsquo;d just stand around watching the team behind him rotate instead of running to the other side and contesting shots.</p>

<p>Yes, prime Shaq would be unstoppable at 350lbs with freakish athleticism, but he would struggle mightily against most guards and wings in the current NBA. Guys are just more skilled and better shooters than they’ve ever been.</p>

<p>However, Shaq from 1992-1997 is a different story. Still 300-330lbs, 1-of-1 athlete, could outrun most modern bigs down the court, great endurance. However, it would be his agility on the perimeter on defense that separates it for me.</p>

<p>Would easily be the best player in the league and would need to be triple teamed on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>Can’t overstate the impact of Phil Jackson and Kurt Rambis unlocking that final level of Shaqness that made him nearly impossible to score on, it helped the Lakers make multiple playoff comebacks, that defense created big scoring runs</p>

<p>I can see Jokic taking his trademark 3pt <del>shots</del>  trebuchet over Shaq, and at a decent clip, would make it fall. Alternately, his passing allows him to master the game not from inside. Or, even playing small-big pick n&rsquo; roll (i.e. forcing Shaq to go through screens = get called for offensive fouls).</p>

<p>Lots of scenarios that would expose Shaq on defense.</p>

      <label for="lmgigw1" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is definitely a better defender than Shaq, but somehow the idea that Shaq was a terrible defender has taken off on this sub, and that’s just not true. He was an average defender because he was lazy on defense a lot of the time, and the frustration came from the fact that his defensive potential was crazy. </p>

<p>E.g. a fit Shaq definitely wouldn’t get “dog walked” by anyone because he had fantastic quickness, footwork and coordination for his size. </p>

<p>But anyway it doesn’t matter too much because he’d be “dogwalking” every one of those bigs like crazy while on offense and scoring at a much higher percentage. </p>

      <label for="lmgj19a" class="commentText"><p>We can&rsquo;t really compare, though, because he&rsquo;d be a different player in this era. Young Shaq would absolutely be athletic enough to hang with the shooting bigs of today. However, he played in a league where his overpowering size was more of an asset than his versatility.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s hard to compare different eras. Shaq growing up 20 years later would simply be a different player. You don&rsquo;t just pick up a guy who grew up in the 70s and 80s and plop him into 2024. Same as of you dropped KAT into the 70s and 80s, he wouldn&rsquo;t have grown up as a shooting big.</p>

<p>I agree it&rsquo;s tough to compare eras, but a big with his skill set would be a pretty notable liability in the modern NBA, since he was not an elite defender, and he was a horrid shooter. You would likely have to play a 2nd defensive big with him, and that guy has to be a good shooter now, bc Shaq provides 0 spacing.</p>

<p>But yes, if he grew up in this era, his game would likely be very different, and he likely would have spent time to develop at least a basic level shooting, like AD.</p>

<p>Ah, here we go. Guess it&rsquo;s time to teach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shaq was repeatedly on the all-defense team</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If by &ldquo;repeatedly&rdquo;, you mean 3x over 19 years, sure. Also he was never on the All-Defensive 1st team. Giannis was named to the All-Defensive 1st team 4x, more times than Shaq was named to any All-Defense team.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Shaq was indeed the runner-up once, and it was the only time in his entire career he was in the top 7 for DPOY. Giannis won DPOY in 2020, and finished in the top 6 five times. Consecutively. He has not finished outside of the top 9 for DPOY since he was 24, in 2019.</p>

      <label for="lmgobki" class="commentText"><p>Difference is, during Peak Shaq era him being a 50% FT shooter still meant that in a time where half court offenses were inefficient compared to today, Shaq making only one free throw (equal to 1 PPP) meant it was a notably efficient possession relative to the most possessions of that era. You just fouled him because that was better than him putting up an easy two points.</p>

<p>Today, with half court offenses becoming more efficient and faster paced, the poor free throw shooting actually does become a problem for the team’s scoring efficiency in the half court.</p>

<p>That said Shaq would still be a monster in today’s league.</p>

Yes, the game is played differently but that doesn’t mean that someone like him with the proper training couldn’t adapt. The guy was an incredible athlete, his post footwork is second to none considering in his prime he was 350 - 375 lbs, plus there was no one who could really stop him from scoring.</p>

<p>Cross era comparisons like this one are difficult because there is no one that I can think of that is truly comparable to Shaq. Giannis might be the closest in his mind because of his aggressive physicality in the paint, but I think that’s about as close as they come as far as comparisons go.</p>

      <label for="lmgwewx" class="commentText"><p>Lakers Shaq which most would equate to his prime is not keeping up on the perimeter in modern NBA. Obviously this is just my opinion but everyone equates speed and quickness in the post to being able to transition to every other area of the floor.</p>

      <label for="lmgm0th" class="commentText"><p>Shaq would dominate any era. Some players just transcend eras. No one argues about greatness of the top 50-60 players even when eras are discussed. Bill Russell would still be great today, look at draymond he&rsquo;s basically that minus the height. Curry would still be great then, look at Jerry west.</p>

<p>For the top players it&rsquo;s mostly the luck of great physical gifts, will power and killer mentality, that has made them. That worked 1000s years back, works today and will work till 11th November 2032 when we&rsquo;ll all die from the asteroid hitting us.</p>
