      <p>Obviously, 2000 - 2006 Lakers/Heat Shaq was way better than any version of Karl and Chuck</p>

<p>But talking only about the 90s</p>

<p>Was Orlando Magic Shaq (who played with Penny)  already a better player than Mailman and Chuck in the 90s.</p>

<p>Edit. You are delusional to say 2000 to 2006 shaq is better than all malone and barkleys versions. Peak barkley and malone are better than 03 to 06 shaq. 06 shaq avged 12 ppg in the finals. Dont ever list him. 05 shaq wasnt even better than wade especially those playoffs</p>

      <label for="ln5cn2w" class="commentText"><p>Barkley faded very fast after his 1993 MVP year. I actually always thought his individual prime was the late 80s - early 90s with the Sixers, but he just didn’t have an MVP or team success like he did with the Suns so we tend to forget that version of Barkley who led the league in TS% and was a better rebounder. He even had the most first place MVP votes in 1990 but didn’t win the award.</p>

<p>So by 1994, I would say Shaq was better than 1994 Barkley. </p>

<p>Meanwhile for Malone, he just had super longevity. I guess he was probably still better than Shaq but 1994-1996 Shaq is kinda close already to Malone. </p>

<p>Again, team success matters a lot to the perception of these players. If Shaq had won in 1995 with a FMVP, his perception of just how good he was in Orlando might change. </p>

I’m guessing him and Gminksi are friends. </p>

<p>Orlando Shaq was great, but he wasn&rsquo;t LA Shaq. He had a lot of athleticism back then that kind of went away as he got bigger. But there were still a fair number of guys in the league that could guard him one-on-one, because he wasn&rsquo;t the size of a house yet. Barkley and Malone had better-rounded games, and they weren&rsquo;t as vulnerable at the free-throw-line.</p>

      <label for="ln6j8ze" class="commentText"><p>He was a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIA/2005.html" target="_blank">23ppg player</a> on the then-fewest rebounds per game of his career, then further fell off in the playoffs (in both production and efficiency):19 ppg on 0.56 FG% (again, a career low for him at the time).</p>

<p>Shaq was essentially washed in 2004 but stretched his career around with a series of wise (or perhaps lucky) moves.</p>

<p>He can cry all he wants about how he should have been MVP in 2005, but consider what he says today about any center who only averages 23 PPG in the regular season&hellip;</p>

      <label for="ln5gh09" class="commentText"><p>No. Malone and Barkley were the only other mvps in the 90&rsquo;s along with Jordan. Both were in their prime while Shaq had a great rookie year and was averaging between 23-26 ppg in his first two years He struggled to score against big defenders like Robinson, Mourning, Ewing etc but by the time he got to LA a lot of the old guard was out leaving him to be the most dominant. Shaq only had post-up game so he had to be good at it.</p>

      <label for="ln5cim1" class="commentText"><p>Better? No. But he was already more a sure thing (or at least valued that way as a franchise cornerstone and floor raiser). With Shaq you knew your team would win high 40s to 50 games. You would have an identity on offense and defense. Both Barkley and Malone for as talented as they were needed a lot of help on offense and defense to unlock their games (tbf the franchises they played for often did that).</p>

<p>When Jordan came back, inside the nba had a segment with Dick Verace where they interviewed a large group of nba players and nearly everyone had MJ as the best player (I remember Penny getting a lot of votes as a runner up interestingly) but for franchise player nearly all of them said Shaq. His presence on offense and defense was just hard to solve</p>

<p>I would say maybe you can give the edge to Shaq from 95 onwards, but no he was not better than Karl Malone in the 90s, Malone actually took care of himself, had better longevity and two MVPs in the decade, even if I don&rsquo;t think he should have won the first one, not to mention when Shaq was reaching his prime Malone and the jazz beat them in five one year and then swept them another if I&rsquo;m remembering correctly in series in which Malone matched up with shaq&rsquo;s production and even outplayed him at times</p>

<p>When Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal was in Orlando I thought he had a chance to be the greatest player to ever play NBA basketball if he dedicated himself fully to basketball and becoming the best.</p>

<p>I never once thought this about Charles Barkley or Karl Malone, and Barkley is one of my all-time very very favorite players in sports history.</p>

<p>Imo Barkley was the second best player in the world the season when he won his MVP though.</p>

      <label for="ln5cxbv" class="commentText"><p>Defensively it&rsquo;s not even close. Shaq beats them all.</p>

<p>By 94 I&rsquo;d say Shaq Malone and Barkley are all about in the same tier offensively in terms of scoring impact. Shaq still has a fairly limited offensive game by this point but he still almost won a scoring title because of impact and sheer physical domination.</p>

<p>So if you consider Shaq was the clear defensive choice, and it&rsquo;s a toss up between the three offensively by 94, I&rsquo;d say yes. Now, we can pick their games apart and I&rsquo;d tell tou that Barkley amd Malone clearly had more game and were MUCH developed offensively by this point, but in the end the game outcome does not care. What matters is impact.</p>

<p>The other things like how Shaq completely opened the floor up for others had a larger impact offensively than Malone or Barkley as well.</p>

<p>Malone was an underrated low post defender, especially in his later years. Barkley was a great rebounder but not the greatest at moving his feet defensively. Shaq had quick feet on both ends. That&rsquo;s what set him apart when considering how much mass he carried, too.</p>

<p>He made 3 straight all defense first teams, so he was pretty properly rated at the time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a case for Shaq being better on defense, simply because center D was more important than PF D, but idk that it wasn&rsquo;t close with Malone.</p>

<p>Year on year I&rsquo;d probably have Malone ahead til maybe 98 or 99, but it&rsquo;s close enough that I wouldn&rsquo;t disagree with Shaq ahead too much</p>
