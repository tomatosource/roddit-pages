      <label for="loouno7" class="commentText"><p>I work in RE and I think it&rsquo;s kind of an issue that goes beyond just greed. This is just my hypothesis, but it makes sense in my mind.</p>

<p>As cost of labor increases (good thing for the average person) it increases the cost for construction. The government can&rsquo;t run every apartment complex and thus you need landlords. Landlords only buy apartments that give them some sort of return, as labor costs go up, construction costs go up, and the return parameters force increased rents.</p>

<p>Government can incentivize affordable housing, but unfortunately these are contractual which means there&rsquo;s an end to the incentives/affordability and the next owner still desires some sort of return.</p>

<p>I compare it to the stock market where there always needs to be a return for what you invest in, and so everything is decided on a short term basis. Many landlords only hold apartments for ~5-10 years and so there is constant churn. A lot of it is greed, but the fact that someone has to manage/maintain the property and get paid to do so will continually drive up rents.</p>

      <label for="lop6xtv" class="commentText"><p>The problem is salaries that were <span class="math inline">\(50-\)</span>60k+ didn&rsquo;t go up at all, but people making <span class="math inline">\(30-\)</span>40k saw big increases, and for the most part that is where construction costs go up dramatically. That will always be the case when you implement a floor for wages, the bottom increases, the middle generally stays the same, but costs of living increases. And this is not an argument for removing min wage or not having a floor, just the likely outcome in the <strong>US</strong>.</p>

<p>Average construction worker has increased pay of 20% from 2021-2023, I&rsquo;d imagine most people making $50k+ did not see that increase, but likely saw the cost increase in rent.</p>

<p>I agree that greed is the issue, but the bigger issue is there is no alternative. There&rsquo;s no way to replace the landlord, just like there&rsquo;s no way to replace the stock market. Both work on short term goals to increase bottom lines for investors.</p>

<p>You can have an apartment building with the people living there owning their apartments. To suggest that you need a landlord owning the building and renting it out is just not accurate.</p>

<p>Even large buildings, you have the individual owners collectively sign an agreement with a management company that takes care of it. No landlord involved.</p>

<p>edit: also - don&rsquo;t need to provide any alternative in this case when what you&rsquo;re saying just isn&rsquo;t true.</p>

      <label for="lop9fcg" class="commentText"><p>So property managers instead of landlords. Management companies require pay, and that pay will increase every year, that is a solution to decrease spikes though, but it still increases cost of living every year. Could be a solution, but housing costs for ownership have eclipsed renting increases by a long shot.</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think single family homes should be able to be rented, but how do you increase ownership percentages? Houses in my area have gone up wayyyyyy faster than rent the last 2 years, and with decreasing interest rates there will continue to go up, while cost of construction still remains very high.</p>

<p>That can depend on where you are in the world. Its very common for a mortgage to be cheaper than rent in Europe, for instance, in countries that have seen more development in the last 25 years. Similar trends are in North America, but the areas that were more developed don&rsquo;t overlap with historically desirable places to live so you have a situation where a mortgage out in randomville is indeed cheap but that&rsquo;s irrelevant to someone who simply doesn&rsquo;t want to live there.</p>

<p>Some areas have it worse, you&rsquo;re right and mortgages are brutal but rent vs mortgage prices reflect so many borderline artificial factors that it&rsquo;s very easy to just handwave it away with &ldquo;change the laws, the market will adjust&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think you have it right when you say that being able to rent single family homes shouldn&rsquo;t really be a thing, but there could be a way to do this that provides enough wiggle room to make people satisfied. There should just be brutally escalating taxes on additional properties beyond your primary residence and a single vacation residence exemption.</p>

<p>The first &lsquo;extra&rsquo; home/apartment you own could still be rented out for a modest income but anything beyond that will be brutally taxed. That&rsquo;d still leave room for property management companies to make a good living by collecting together a group of people willing to each sign on their one reasonably taxed additional property into a collective pool with which to construct an apartment enterprise owned by many individuals but managed by the company. The company could even facilitate loans to people who would otherwise be entirely unable to make such an investment themselves, with the idea being that they end up with ownership after X-years/Y-dollars have been paid back.</p>

<p>Property management firms aren&rsquo;t saints, but there is at least in principle a service rendered and value generated. They would be earning their money by doing work on behalf of individuals who own the units at a much more reasonably distributed scale. This way you&rsquo;d have rental units helping to support a great deal of people who are using the tax status on this property to earn money instead of having all of this wealth channeled into significantly fewer individuals.</p>

<p>In general, the whole concept of a single individual earning great wealth by owning tons of housing has to go. It&rsquo;s entirely unnecessary, does more harm than good, and can be replaced with something at least a little better. I&rsquo;d feel fine knowing that 1 renting family means rent money going to 1 owning family who either directly invested into housing or took on debt to do so. Will the better off remain so? Sure, but it&rsquo;s at least distributed to a far greater number of families than the current situation where you can have 100s or even 1000s of renting families funneling money to a single owning family. Considering the additional space for management companies taking on the role of landlords and competing with each other to earn their clients as well, I&rsquo;d much prefer a system without landlords.</p>

<p>Basketball club Sutjeska from Foča, a member of the First League of the RS (Republika Srpska), decided on a very interesting move that resonated throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.   </p>

<p>Namely, a few days ago KK Sutjeska thanked the director of the Penitentiary in Foča for providing accommodation for the basketball players of the Foča club inside their building.   </p>

<p>&ldquo;We would like to thank the Administration of KPZ Foča, headed by acting director Bojan Kostić, who within the legal framework met the Sutjeska Basketball Club, providing accommodation for our players at minimal prices. At a time of high rents in our city, this support will significantly facilitate the work of the club and  contribute to our further development. Thank you for your support!&rdquo; said KK Sutjeska.</p>
