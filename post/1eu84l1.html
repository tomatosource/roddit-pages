</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>People pride themselves on being able to name the exact stats a player averaged 25 years ago but can’t breakdown a basketball play.</p>

<p>They’ll debate old vs new players all day but don’t know any play other than a pick and roll.</p>

<p>The game tactically is very interesting but you’ll rarely ever hear anything related to how smart lineups were utilized, and how detailed play mechanics were implemented. And even when you do hear about ‘adjustments’ they’re used as some ambiguous thing rather than the specifics of the adjustments talked about.</p>

<p>As for your stat, I don’t think that would have much of an effect. If they completely got rid of the defensive 3 seconds, now we are talking.</p>

If you don’t talk box score than it devolves into weird subjective discussions like the Steph “gravity” argument or Lebron  “the greatest facilitator” where there is no real way to have a discussion about that.</p>

      <label for="likhcip" class="commentText"><p>Incredibly frustrating when trying to genuinely follow your own team as well. I went out of my way last year to try and watch every Sixers game I could, probably watched at least 65 of the 82, and whatever I didn&rsquo;t watch I likely saw all the highlights of.</p>

<p>It made me super high on Maxey but people who box score or just highlight watch are insistent &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t be a #1&rdquo; because of the time with Embiid away. Despite the fact that if you actually watched the games, you saw Maxey spend 2 months as a 6&rsquo;2 PG 1st option in a system and team designed around the 7&rsquo;0 280lbs Center.</p>

<p>Buddy Hield forgot how to shoot and Oubre was still finding his rhythm back. Maxey was quite literally the entire driving force of the offense, which meant taking more shots and shouldering the attacks.</p>

<p>Dude balled out with what he could around him and imo showed that, if the time comes for a new team around him when Embiid can&rsquo;t go, he actually could adapt to drive it with more appropriate roles surrounding him</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s extremely rare to find a player or team with bad box score stats, that still win games and are successful in the NBA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such a disingenuous argument. I never said that the box score was meaningless, I think it has a purpose, I just also think that the best way to evaluate a player isn&rsquo;t by stats and numbers.</p>

<p>A player&rsquo;s impact is not reflected by the box score. Just saying &ldquo;Good players get good numbers most of the time&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a good argument, because no one is disagreeing with that premise, the issue is all the little exceptions and context and nuance that could be avoided if we talked about what the guy was actually doing on the court.</p>

<p>TL;DR: If you want to have a real discussion on why people don&rsquo;t like using the boxscore, I&rsquo;m all for it, but to put it simply, <strong><em>you get more from watching the game than you do watching the boxscore.</em></strong></p>

<p>I think that’s ultimately what makes a good coach into a <em>great</em> coach. a good coach can manage the team’s best chance at success. a <em>great</em> coach can make his players greater than the sum of their parts, just in choosing how to attack and defend with the strengths that are on the floor together.</p>

<p>Some basketball fans don’t care about the 11 different types of pick and roll coverage, they just want to know if the other team scored or not. To me, it’s a lot more fun to analyze the tactics being deployed, but other people don’t enjoy the nitty gritty of defensive rotations or off-ball action.</p>

<p>I’m never going to tell someone they’re less of a fan because they enjoy consuming basketball in a different way than I do, it’s just a matter of preference. Some people really want to know how their car works, other people just want it to go when they press the gas and stop when they press the brakes.</p>

      <label for="lijh0gg" class="commentText"><p>I took the Westbrook triple double seasons with a truckload of salt as he was blatantly going for the stats. Having Adams box out 2 men so Russ could get boards, Westbrook showing anger when teammates missed  shots off his passes. Under two minutes to go in a close game and Westbrook is shooting a 3 with 16 on the shot clock without running a play. He didn&rsquo;t play winning basketball, also when he had Durant he was still taking more shots and crazy shots. His bball IQ was poor.</p>

      <label for="lijqvju" class="commentText"><p>It’s actually staggering how many people don’t even watch games! They just look at the final score and box score and maybe, MAYBE, that little 10 minute highlight video the NBA does.</p>

<p>This is why people act like Jordan never missed a shot, because they’ve never seen him miss a shot! It’s a highlight tape world and people have never seen possessions of basketball that just end with good defense and a solid defensive rebound.</p>

      <label for="likexhc" class="commentText"><p>I actually think this is dying out because of the internet.</p>

<p>Back in the day, sitting around drinking and bullshitting about player&rsquo;s stats was a huge topic of conversation among dudes. With access to the internet, knowing how many hits Pete Rose had or how many scoring titles Jordan won has become frivolous to remember because we all have near immediate access to that information.</p>

Most of these guys get physical training from people who were not at their level physically, but they studied kinesiology and other aspects of strength and endurance training. Why would someone not be able to talk about the nuance of the game, if they were an active learner in the sport?</p>

      <label for="liikcal" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;played professionally&rdquo; is too narrow. I&rsquo;d include NBA coaches, video staff, and others who are really close to the game, as well as possibly some more cerebral college players who never made it in the league, and some college coaches and assistants who break down NBA film to develop their own teams&rsquo; schemes.</p>

<p>….they literally have to learn countless plays from their coaches and coordinators. Unless they act on pure memorization, they understand it to at least a fairly high degree. But higher than the average person here would be able to conversate</p>
