<p>First 7 games? 30%.</p>

<p>Last 8 games? 30%.</p>

<p>In Between? An 18 game sample size of shooting 43%</p>

<p>That feels like it might just be a heater.</p>

<p>Jeremy Sochan went on a 22-game run last year where he shot 42% from three.   He also had a 29-game run where he shot 21% from three.</p>

<p>Do you know what that .571 represents?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s your sample. 7 shots.</p>

<p>And the 60% in Euroleague?</p>

<p><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p>So <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> last year. That&rsquo;s your sample. From that, you can draw the conclusion that he doesn&rsquo;t draw fouls and get to the line. You cannot draw the conclusion that he can&rsquo;t make free throws. That&rsquo;s a very stupid conclusion to draw from that data.</p>

<p>I notice your mention of 29% in LNB ignores that he shot 39% in Euroleague last year from three, as well.</p>

      <label for="l90jkez" class="commentText"><p>The main risk with him is that he didn&rsquo;t have a great season until his junior year, and his shooting percentages weren&rsquo;t <em>so</em> high that you can be confident he&rsquo;s a good shooter even if he got lucky.  The odds of his shooting season being an outlier year are unfortunately decently high, even with the number of threes he took.  Still definitely think he is worth drafting somewhere in that range, I&rsquo;m just not as excited about him as I would be if he were a better shooter earlier in his career or had better underlying peripherals.</p>

<p>Not a very good shooter (72% career FT shooter and only 1 of 3 years above 30% from 3)</p>

<p>Elite rebounder for his size and very good defender</p>

<p>With all that said, Marcus Smart, Josh Hart, and Pat Beverley have showed there&rsquo;s a role for players in this mold.  While he doesn&rsquo;t have star potential, I do think he&rsquo;s one of the safer bets in the draft to be a key contributor.</p>

      <label for="l91181a" class="commentText"><p>He may be 6&rsquo;2, but he plays much larger than that due to his wingspan, vertical, and anticipation.</p>

<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s definitely an off-ball guard in the NBA unless he can make big strides with his handle.</p>

<p>Carter shot 37.7% from 3 on almost 7 attempts per game last year. He improved his percentage on increased volume in every season in college. His success this year was the result of working with his dad all summer on his shot, and I highly doubt it&rsquo;s a fluke.</p>

<p>Carter was top-100 in defensive rebounding percentage last year, and he was the best guard defender in the Big East.</p>

<p>With his pedigree, athleticism, and work ethic, I definitely agree with characterizing him as a safe bet. I think the ceiling for him is probably a slightly less switchable Marcus Smart who also makes better decisions on offense. Excited to see him at the next level.</p>

Can come off the bench to spell Ja. I think its a perfect fit. Will have two of the fastest players in the league with him here as well as a new perimeter defender to add to our 2 DPOY players.</p>

      <label for="l91l17z" class="commentText"><p>Pat Bev I suppose is the closest comp but even he was a PG for most of his career. Smart can play PG and is a good to great passer and Hart is pushing 6’5” and has good length.</p>

<p>Can’t say I’ve watched much of Carter but I’m always nervous about this kind of player. Lack of both positional size and shooting is a death sentence in this NBA unless you are absolutely elite at something else (passing and inside scoring usually).</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if you can play good D on guards if you just get abused on any kind of switches. I suppose this is a weak draft but I’d have some serious concerns</p>

I liked his facilitating a lot more than some people from what I&rsquo;ve seen. He was the top scorer, facilitator, rebounder, and stealer on his team so he literally did everything. A lot of his threes were from five feet behind the three point line so hopefully he takes smarter more open shots in the league. (fr though go watch his highlights it&rsquo;s insane how deep he was shooting from). Just being a guard who can get 19 points/9 rebounds/ and 3 stocks a game is crazy. He was playing good teams like UConn/Marquette/Creighton as well so it&rsquo;s not like the competition was abysmal. Gonna come into the league being the fastest player and a top guard defender Day 1.</p>

      <label for="l90cyc0" class="commentText"><p>He’s likely to be a very good defender at the NBA level . He’s definitely a worse shooter than Shepard (who has some of the best shooting numbers of any prospect in the past 5 years), but there are concerns about whether or not Sheppard’s lack of lateral mobility will prevent him from being a good defender at the NBA level.</p>

But there are also better prospects than a 22 year old, 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; shooting guard who only has one year of actually shooting well under his belt. (Especially since the FT shooting doesn&rsquo;t make it look like he&rsquo;s a great shooter.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure he&rsquo;s a better prospect than Blake and Malaki, who are both a year younger than he is.</p>

      <label for="l90udeq" class="commentText"><p>Malaki Branham is a dog shit defender who is a completely undesirable archetype because he plays like a small wing who gets hunted, is an ineffective inside the arc “scorer”, and an unimpressive playmaker for others.</p>

<p>Wesley has his flaws too but is atleast more interesting as a gamble since he has real + athletic traits and defensive pressuring ability. However he plays like he’s terrified in the half court with the ball in his hands. A Modern day Eric Snow isn’t going to play important minutes.</p>

<p>It is. He&rsquo;s terrible, but he&rsquo;s not the worst.</p>

<p>And yeah, he&rsquo;s a two guard. For some reason, Pop insists upon trying to play non-PGs at PG lately, and I do not fucking get it.</p>

<p>IDK if the defense will improve, but he&rsquo;s going to be a <em>fine</em> offensive player if we stop trying to make Point Branham happen.</p>

<p>Im sold on the person that&rsquo;s what makes me think he can be a solid shooter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed but his shot looks fixable at least</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s 6&rsquo;6 without shoes and if he adds more weight I dont think it would be crazy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Draft BPA</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I feel like Castle and Carter would be the best players available.</p>

      <label for="l91i6wi" class="commentText"><p>I don’t necessarily think that’s a reason to buy into someone’s shooting, you’re obviously free to feel how you feel but I don’t think I’d base my shooting confidence on who he is as a person</p>

<p>I agree that castles shot looks fixable, I guess my point was that I don’t think the spurs should take two questionable shooters, I think one of their picks should be to trade for a shooter with or use it on Shepard/risacher/dillingham/salaun/etc, one of the better shooting guys</p>

<p>I agree he probably could play the 3 I guess that point wasn’t really necessary by me</p>

<p>While I normally agree with BPA I don’t think BPA is so obvious as prior drafts and unless you’re really really sure about someone in that range you should consider fit, like many have said before this draft is as if you took away the first 6 picks in a normal draft and started from there, and as we know you can begin to ignore bpa after a certain point in every draft and pick for fit</p>

<p>Those two very well might be bpa but I think I would go in a different direction vs use my 2 picks on those two, I wouldn’t hate taking them because they’re both really cool prospects and the defense at least would be good, but I think I would prefer to draft differently</p>
