      <p>No matter how good an NBA player is, time will eventually come when they will have to call it a day and retire from the game. That being said, who do you think is the NBA player that ended their career in the best way?</p>

<p>My pick is definitely David Robinson. In his last game, he had 13 points, 17 rebounds, 2 blocks and won his 2nd NBA championship. Pretty great way to end your career, I&rsquo;d say. To quote the announcer of that game: &ldquo;The Admiral fighting the final wave, about to come to shore with his second crown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>March 11, 2020. Knicks are beating the Hawks in overtime of a somewhat meaningless game. With 18 seconds left the NBA announces that it has suspended the season. Vince Carter checks in with the crowd chanting his name, pulls up at the top of the key and hits a 3. Walks off into the sunset after playing in 4 different decades.</p>

      <label for="ldxhte8" class="commentText"><p>I think this is accurate. Not that he totally reshaped his game, necessarily, but a lot of people (myself included) assumed his fall off would be dramatic as his athleticism declined. Or its that his athletic twilight was still in the upper echelon in a league full of freak athleticism.</p>

      <label for="ldxortt" class="commentText"><p>Ya this is true. In hindsight, he shot 41% from 3 on 6 attempts per game in his 3rd season in the league back in 2000, and has quite a few seasons of 38% or better on reasonably high volume so it makes sense he was able to transition to elite role player. But the value of a role player like that didn&rsquo;t really become so apparent until the importance of 3pt shooting and spacing was highlighted by Curry. As much as he adapted to become the perfect role player, the definition of a perfect role player changed at the exact same time as he entered his twilight years and met him in the middle somewhere.</p>

      <label for="ldy05yz" class="commentText"><p>There was a little bit of effort, but ended up being too little too late. mo Pete, Rafer Alston, and Chris Bosh were all good - not to mention the Raptors 2003 tank job COULD have hypothetically landed Lebron or Wade instead of Bosh but that&rsquo;s not relevant I guess.</p>

<p>The Raptors doomed themselves by letting TMac walk. They had to do whatever possible to retain him, and flubbing that just messed everything up. VC and TMac are 2 of the best offensive players of the 2000s and were both on the Raptors at the same time. The Raptors turned them into nothing - no winning, no assets, no pieces&hellip; A horrific fumble job.</p>

<p>Though in fairness, neither ever contributed to a championship or were a &ldquo;star&rdquo; on a team that made it past the second round. So maybe it&rsquo;s rose-tinted glasses to look back and say we could have won with two guys fairly notorious for not winning when it mattered.</p>

Either his running mate (Grant Hill/Yao) or he was injured every single time. And when he and Yao was healthy for once they met the one team that had a 3pt shooting center which countered Rockets perfectly</p>

His late years and with the Nets, his injuries and then Orlando (playing 4 out around Dwight) probably made him realize he needed to adapt and he did.</p>

<p>VC signed with the Mavs in 2012 to play 6th man (he hit those shots against the Spurs, amazing 1st round series going to 7) and from then on he was always a bench guy.</p>

      <label for="ldy3pch" class="commentText"><p>I think Vince Carter’s maturity had been a really good story to watch as it unfolded. He went from being loved to hated in Toronto, redemption in NJ, then disappointment in Orlando, then a travelling veteran who eventually seem to have found closure with some of the Raptors fan base. While his career could’ve been more, it has nevertheless been a very unique story as it stands.</p>

There surely would have been a ceremony or something along those lines during the final few weeks of a regular season to honour his legacy. Not a champion but definitely one of the most impactful players of the early 2000s NBA</p>

Prior to that game he averaged 16.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.8 on 35.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub>.5. Kobe may have best scoring and memorable walk off game ever, but that season as a whole for both himself and his team was a complete mess. This was the same year as the DLo-Nick Young fiasco</p>

      <label for="ldyyasx" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Marbury was probably the most open minded of any NBA player (outside of players that were actually Asian) who went over there. He wasn’t like the stars who go over just to sell shoes and clothes, and you know that’s the only reason they’re there, and he wasn’t just there because of international competition/Olympics. He was just there to hoop and see what China and the people were like, and he didn’t seem to carry a lot of assumptions with him. That’s why they embraced him and love him so much, to them there was never any other NBA player who approached them the way he did. Honestly you see it in some of the things he does in the US too, but the media really did skew how he was seen. I’ve never seen anyone in Reddit or basketball forums talk about how he hired barbers (I think it was 6 or 8, it wasn’t 1-2) to give free haircuts at Coney Island because he knew what it was like to not be able to afford one as a kid. I’ve very rarely heard people talk about how he gave $1M after hurricane Katrina-I don’t think he ever talked about it publicly except for interviews where they asked him about it. People make fun of his Starbury shoes but he really did that shit from his heart, Marbury is a super good dude. I used to hate him because he played selfish, but then I read his quote where he said people hate on him for how he played but if he hadn’t played that way he wouldn’t have gotten maxed. Then I found out what he spent some of that money on and I became a fan. I love hoops and I’m definitely a basketball junkie, but at the end of the day what happens on the court doesn’t matter at all compared with you do off the court with the things you take from the game.</p>

<p>Edit: I was thinking about it, and the older you get the more it’s how life is in your personal relationships too. Everyone else who went to China, it was just business.  But if you just care, listen, and don’t want anything from people, people will have a really deep appreciation for you. It’s difficult for young people to know because they have a lot of time and having money or connections is not much of a factor, but this is especially true the older you get because everyone starts to have less and less time, so the time they do have is allocated either to close friends or to help advance a goal.</p>

      <label for="ldxsakq" class="commentText"><p>Magic Johnson. In 1991 he was the second best player in the NBA, behind MJ and his team was a perennial title contender. He abruptly was forced to retire after finding out he had HIV. He was 31 years old with a wife and kids and another baby on the way and had instantly gone from the most loved player in the game to a tragic figure and a punchline.</p>

<p>In ‘91, HIV/AIDS was a death sentence and still largely considered a disease killing gay people and heroin junkies. No one as successful and beloved as Magic had publicly fought it and no one at all had beaten it. People thought you couldn’t even risk touching a person with HIV.</p>

<p>So when Magic came back in 1996 as a 36 year old who was still healthy enough to play, it was a miracle. He had been retired for more than 4 years, was a little out of shape, but could still make a significant contribution on a 53 win team that eventually lost in the playoffs to the defending champion Rockets.</p>

<p>But more important than the wins and losses, Magic got back to fulfilling his life’s purpose and, by doing so, he closed one of the greatest careers in NBA history on his own terms, proved that HIV wasn’t a death sentence, and showed the world that people living with it didn’t need to be viewed as pariahs or tragic figures. They could still be the players and family members we loved. Even though he only played 32 games, I would imagine those 4 months meant everything to him.</p>

<p>He was quite impressive at his age before he fucked his knee up. It was very entertaining watching an older MJ school the young cats with just basic fundamentals.</p>

      <label for="ldxye4d" class="commentText"><p>I swear people look at Wizards Jordan with mierda-tinted goggles. He still averaged 20+ ppg in his years there, despite injuries. The only reason he was &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and people act like he was a bum was because relative to the greatest player to ever touch a basketball, 20ppg seems kinda mid. But you know who was also averaging 22-23ppg in 2001-2002 like Jordan was? Ray Allen, Dirk, KG. Kobe averaged 25 that year. Like, MJ was in lockstep with the best players in the league, despite clearly not being the best version of himself anymore. That just tells me that he was so good that when he &ldquo;fell off&rdquo;, he was still better than 90% of the league.</p>

      <label for="ldxmjou" class="commentText"><p>Kurt Thomas. He was one of my favorite players on those post-Ewing Knicks, the only one that seemed to actually give a shit about winning. The Knicks brought him back for that one good season. Melo and Amare both got hurt on a road trip and the Knicks were on a losing streak, I think. The Jazz were the last game of the trip and I doubt he put up big numbers, but he was instrumental to the win and keeping the season alive. He ended up getting hurt that game and never returning. Crazy year lol Tyson Chandler with Thomas, Kmart and Marcus Camby off the bench</p>
