      <p>No matter how good an NBA player is, time will eventually come when they will have to call it a day and retire from the game. That being said, who do you think is the NBA player that ended their career in the best way?</p>

<p>My pick is definitely David Robinson. In his last game, he had 13 points, 17 rebounds, 2 blocks and won his 2nd NBA championship. Pretty great way to end your career, I&rsquo;d say. To quote the announcer of that game: &ldquo;The Admiral fighting the final wave, about to come to shore with his second crown!&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="ldwvrra" class="commentText"><p>I’m going with a weird one.</p>

<p>March 11, 2020. Knicks are beating the Hawks in overtime of a somewhat meaningless game. With 18 seconds left the NBA announces that it has suspended the season. Vince Carter checks in with the crowd chanting his name, pulls up at the top of the key and hits a 3. Walks off into the sunset after playing in 4 different decades.</p>

      <label for="ldxhte8" class="commentText"><p>I think this is accurate. Not that he totally reshaped his game, necessarily, but a lot of people (myself included) assumed his fall off would be dramatic as his athleticism declined. Or its that his athletic twilight was still in the upper echelon in a league full of freak athleticism.</p>

      <label for="ldxortt" class="commentText"><p>Ya this is true. In hindsight, he shot 41% from 3 on 6 attempts per game in his 3rd season in the league back in 2000, and has quite a few seasons of 38% or better on reasonably high volume so it makes sense he was able to transition to elite role player. But the value of a role player like that didn&rsquo;t really become so apparent until the importance of 3pt shooting and spacing was highlighted by Curry. As much as he adapted to become the perfect role player, the definition of a perfect role player changed at the exact same time as he entered his twilight years and met him in the middle somewhere.</p>

<p>So he did that through the mindset that this could be the last moment of a solid 20 year career, and still iced it.</p>

<p>Love to see it.</p>

Prior to that game he averaged 16.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.8 on 35.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>82</sub>.5. Kobe may have best scoring and memorable walk off game ever, but that season as a whole for both himself and his team was a complete mess. This was the same year as the DLo-Nick Young fiasco</p>

Late in the 4th, Dirk has the ball at the top of the circle, just inside the 3 point line and Drew Eubanks is guarding him like its game 7 of the Finals. Pop is screaming at Eubanks to back off from the sideline and Dirk just leaned back and drilled one of his one leg fades right in Drew&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>MJ fits if you ignore his Wizards stint.</p>

<p>(btw, the detroit lions and incentivizing all-time greats to retire prematurely, name a better combo).</p>

      <label for="ldwxpe7" class="commentText"><p>As someone unfortunately old enough (I turn 40 this year, fuck) to have seen MJ’s Wizards stint, I have no real problem with it.</p>

<p>I’m a DC resident too and was at the time as well so I got every game locally and I watched a whole lot of Wizards MJ.</p>

<p>He was quite impressive at his age before he fucked his knee up. It was very entertaining watching an older MJ school the young cats with just basic fundamentals.</p>

      <label for="ldxmjou" class="commentText"><p>Kurt Thomas. He was one of my favorite players on those post-Ewing Knicks, the only one that seemed to actually give a shit about winning. The Knicks brought him back for that one good season. Melo and Amare both got hurt on a road trip and the Knicks were on a losing streak, I think. The Jazz were the last game of the trip and I doubt he put up big numbers, but he was instrumental to the win and keeping the season alive. He ended up getting hurt that game and never returning. Crazy year lol Tyson Chandler with Thomas, Kmart and Marcus Camby off the bench</p>

      <label for="ldxnzl1" class="commentText"><p>This isn&rsquo;t the answer because his actual final game was the game after, but I have to shoutout Dirk&rsquo;s last home game. The state-of-the-art presentation and the fact that all five of his heroes were there to honor him made for a ceremony that&rsquo;s still kinda unmatched to me.</p>
