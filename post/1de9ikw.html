<p>I get the point he was trying to make. The game&rsquo;s different now. Players are more athletic, more skilled, and more specialized.</p>

<p>But he could have made those points without denigrating the people who came before him and built the league so that his dumbass could have a career.</p>

<p>He said bob cousy was better all time than cp3.  WHY because you don&rsquo;t compare eras</p>

<p>You think if you took lebron and dropped him into 1940 he&rsquo;d look like lebron?</p>

<p>Fucking hell no.  He&rsquo;d be skinny as a stick, wear converse and have a part time job.  You compare him to who he plays against and his resources of the time</p>

<p>He wouldnt have the nutrition, the diet, the supplements, the trainers, the technology, the gear, the doctors, the medicine.. none of the shit he has today.</p>

<p>JJ is so fucking small brained he is picturing taking some guy from 1930 and dropping him into 2024 nba.</p>

      <label for="l8af2w3" class="commentText"><p>The segment was 2 minutes of nonstop disrespecting Chris Paul. JJ says you can&rsquo;t compare eras, the great players would always be great, let&rsquo;s celebrate Cousy in his era. Mad Dog keeps trolling him talking about how Chris Paul isn&rsquo;t an all time great and Cousy is so much better. JJ gets easily rattled and mad and makes the comment about plumbers and fireman at the end.</p>

<p>Just saying it&rsquo;s funny how this comment keeps getting brought up when it&rsquo;s in the context of disrespecting a current great player and it wasn&rsquo;t the thesis of an argument, it was something said after JJ got too in his feelings about being trolled on a hot take show.</p>

      <label for="l8ac4vi" class="commentText"><p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t need to be a hall of famer athlete to discuss how the level of competition has changed over the decades. The access to resources to get stronger, faster then to recover has widened significantly. The collegiate level of competition has grown a greater talent pool to choose from.</p>

<p>Comparing eras one to another is something I avoid.</p>

      <label for="l8aaru4" class="commentText"><p>JJ wasn&rsquo;t talking about himself.  He and Chris Russo were arguing whether or not Chris Paul was an all-time great.</p>

<p>Russo was dismissing CP3 because he didn&rsquo;t win multiple rings, ignoring that those rings (edit: for Bob Cousy) came in an 8-11 team league where half the league were non-professionals.</p>

<p>The point is that it&rsquo;s harder to win a championship in the 2020&rsquo;s than it was for Boston in the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even understand how that&rsquo;s such a hot take.</p>

      <label for="l8admmd" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think people take issue with his point, it’s the snarkiness in which he delivered it. These guys were still the best basketball players in the world at the time and they did it with limited resources.</p>

<p>If we want to bring up context, Jerry West, Bob Cousy and their peers didn’t have a million dollars to sink into their physical fitness like LeBron does. Their training facilities weren’t first class. They played in converse sneakers.</p>

<p>You can think Chris Paul is better than Cousy, maybe he is. But you don’t have to go out and basically call everybody that played in the 50s and 60s a bum while you do it. JJ’s free to think how he wants, but people are allowed to think it’s disrespectful too. Especially the dudes that played in that era.</p>

      <label for="l8achbi" class="commentText"><p>Reddick said Cousy was being defended by plumbers and firemen. That is by definition disrespectful. Instead of treating his competition in a way that shows they’re important (respect), he could have been like they were the best players in the era, but they were just worse than players today because the game has progressed. That would be respectful. Instead he simplified professional basketball players down to plumbers and firemen, which you might agree with, but it is the literal definition of disrespectful.</p>

People rise to their level of competition so we can’t say either way how players from the 60s/70s would fair today. They may have adapted their game to be just as dominant as they were then.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people are misremembering the clip or what. He says exactly this, that you can&rsquo;t compare pre-1980 with the modern era, the great players would be great in any era, let&rsquo;s celebrate Cousy in his era. Mad Dog keeps trolling him and JJ gets way too in his feelings and rattled and says the plumbers and fireman comment pissed off at the end. It wasn&rsquo;t like the crux of his argument, he just got unnecessarily pissed off on a hot take show that Chris Paul is not worse than Cousy.</p>
