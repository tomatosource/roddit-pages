<p>JJ was disrespectful as shit.</p>

<p>I get the point he was trying to make. The game&rsquo;s different now. Players are more athletic, more skilled, and more specialized.</p>

<p>But he could have made those points without denigrating the people who came before him and built the league so that his dumbass could have a career.</p>

      <label for="l8af2w3" class="commentText"><p>The segment was 2 minutes of nonstop disrespecting Chris Paul. JJ says you can&rsquo;t compare eras, the great players would always be great, let&rsquo;s celebrate Cousy in his era. Mad Dog keeps trolling him talking about how Chris Paul isn&rsquo;t an all time great and Cousy is so much better. JJ gets easily rattled and mad and makes the comment about plumbers and fireman at the end.</p>

<p>Just saying it&rsquo;s funny how this comment keeps getting brought up when it&rsquo;s in the context of disrespecting a current great player and it wasn&rsquo;t the thesis of an argument, it was something said after JJ got too in his feelings about being trolled on a hot take show.</p>

      <label for="l8b44x1" class="commentText"><p>JJ was trying to say that lack of playoff success shouldn&rsquo;t mean Chris Paul isn&rsquo;t considered an all time great and that you can&rsquo;t judge him by the same championship standards that players from older generations are judged by.</p>

<p>His problem was trying to say Cousy had an easier path to championships because he played against &ldquo;plumbers and firemen&rdquo;.  The problem with that was that Cousy also had to work a real job.  Everyone did.  The fact that players from Cousy&rsquo;s era had to get jobs and couldn&rsquo;t train 365 days a year doesn&rsquo;t diminish Cousy&rsquo;s accomplishments at all because those were the conditions he had to play under also.</p>

<p>That just made JJ&rsquo;s comments sound needlessly disrespectful.</p>

I still find them impressive, since the talent in the league is condensed into more teams, but only needing 7 playoff wins to get a chip is a valid comparison to today‚Äôs NBA.

      <label for="l8arv1f" class="commentText"><p>You can easily defend a friend without disrespecting an entire era of basketball. I&rsquo;ve always hated JJs TV personality for making disingenuous remarks about the older eras. Most of those players, especially from the 70s and earlier could be playing in this modern era almost effortlessly. Put a bunch of those old players from back then onto the Pacers today and you&rsquo;d see there&rsquo;d be almost no difference. They played in an extremely high paced era too. Different rules, but they&rsquo;d adapt almost instantly. People act like these older eras didn&rsquo;t have to run up and down the court for 48 minutes non stop too.</p>

<p>What am I reading lmao. Go compare shooting efficiency from the 50s to now, it&rsquo;s a different galaxy.</p>

<p>If you want to say that if they were raised in this era, sure. In that case it&rsquo;s a complete hypothetical. But if you straight up teleported a guy from the 50s to now they&rsquo;d be cooked.</p>

<p>He said bob cousy was better all time than cp3.  WHY because you don&rsquo;t compare eras</p>

<p>You think if you took lebron and dropped him into 1940 he&rsquo;d look like lebron?</p>

<p>Fucking hell no.  He&rsquo;d be skinny as a stick, wear converse and have a part time job.  You compare him to who he plays against and his resources of the time</p>

<p>He wouldnt have the nutrition, the diet, the supplements, the trainers, the technology, the gear, the doctors, the medicine.. none of the shit he has today.</p>

<p>JJ is so fucking small brained he is picturing taking some guy from 1930 and dropping him into 2024 nba.</p>

<p>you cannot compare eras.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can compare eras. People say that because when you compare eras previous era almost always be inferior and people get mad like here. West here mocks JJ for averaging 12 points. How many players from West&rsquo;s era can do that? I&rsquo;m sure West himself can but how many more? Is there 10 players?</p>

<p>You can talk about being pioneers, not having resources etc. All valid of course. But if we compare the talent and the ability new eras would always be better. Otherwise we&rsquo;ll have a dying sport in our hands.</p>

<p>But in really old highlights of playoffs you still saw guys defend Jerry West staying on him. They weren&rsquo;t just letting these guys be open and take easy shots so it&rsquo;s not like the game was totally different.</p>

<p>And the paint was packed way more so it wasn&rsquo;t like scoring came easy. Now you can&rsquo;t pack the paint with the type of 3 shooting that&rsquo;s out there now.</p>

<p>Kleber currently gets minutes in the final and he&rsquo;s absolutely awful.</p>

<p>34 year old Wilt did great against 23 year old MVP Kareem.</p>

      <label for="l8bbw4h" class="commentText"><p>The entirety of the game has improved but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the competition gap has decreased. It&rsquo;s not like West, Wilt, Russell, Cousy, and all the other greats had access to 2020 technology and knowledge while playing against people with those of the day. Those players are all superior to JJ in any era and even more so growing up at the same time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to think that and it goes the other way too. LeBron, Curry, KD, Giannis, all of today&rsquo;s great could have excelled in any era too. Great players will adjust to how the game is played. They could play in more physical eras if that&rsquo;s how the game was played. LeBron in his prime could literally destroy someone that attempts to foul him hard if that shit was allowed. He would make the Bad Boy Pistons think twice about contact if he drove in full force.</p>

Don&rsquo;t forget their Spanx to keep their muscles from over extending, and space age shoes, sports medicine, special &ldquo;treatments&rdquo; (PEDs, anti-aging) in Germany.</p>

<p>NBA players playing under more older school rules in FIBA look lost and just jack up 3s hoping to get streaky.</p>

<p>NBA players cried for joy when FIBA seeing how embarrassing it was for NBA players aligned their &ldquo;gather step&rdquo; rule to align with the NBA not too long ago because they were being called so much for travel/double dribble.</p>

At 84 he drove 2 hours in the middle of winter to meet my Dad to watch an Iowa State basketball game and looked old man invincible till his stroke then it was a nursing home and slow decline of 5 years. My Grandma is starting a decline now at 93 this year(voice weaker on the phone and she had a fall) with zero health issues. A few falls can beat up the body quickly at that age. My Grandma&rsquo;s sister died at 100 because of a fall.</p>

Game 3 vs. the Knicks they were down 2 and he hits a buzzer beating beyond half court heave at the end of regulation.  Again, there was no 3pt line back then so it only counted for 2pts and the game went to OT where they lost.  This series went 7 games and is famously known for Willis Reed coming back in Game 7 while Walt Frazier had the game of his life.</p>

<p>But yes, little known fact was that Jerry West would 100% be doing Eastbays and shit if he played today. But he played in an era without breakaway rims so dunking hard back then was a great way to destroy your elbows.</p>

<p>Many articles (and wikipedia) say that he could get 16&rdquo; above the rim, which yeah, seems a little bit lower than a 46&rdquo; vertical would get you, but still plenty athletic for a 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; guard, even by today&rsquo;s standards. Maybe it&rsquo;s something more like a 36&rdquo; vertical in reality. Here&rsquo;s a video of him getting 14&rdquo; above the rim at 35 years old. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/w6rcg0/on_the_topic_of_jerry_west_being_unathletic_here/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/w6rcg0/on_the_topic_of_jerry_west_being_unathletic_here/</a></p>

It isn‚Äôt the all time easiest run, and the discrediting being done was too much after this postseason, but it definitely leans towards the easier half of runs. Even if seeds don‚Äôt tell the whole story, it‚Äôs still the easiest run by seeds in NBA history, and that is factored in.</p>

<p>It being an easier run compared to normal does not discredit your win, you don‚Äôt need to match the bad takes of it being the easiest run ever with your own bad take in that it was a more difficult than average playoff run.</p>

The access to resources to get stronger, faster then to recover has widened significantly. The collegiate level of competition has grown a greater talent pool to choose from.</p>

<p>Comparing eras one to another is something I avoid.</p>

      <label for="l8arci3" class="commentText"><p>Top modern athletes are almost always better than the best athletes of previous eras. That‚Äôs much easier to see in sports like swimming or running where it‚Äôs timed. In sports where you play an opposing team it‚Äôs harder. But one of the main reasons they‚Äôre able to is because they learned from their predecessors. I don‚Äôt think JJs point was entirely wrong but he went about it very disrespectfully.</p>

<p>As a funny anecdote on that from another sport, pretty much all Michael Phelps‚Äô records have been broken. Last I checked he only had one left and it was a relay. And his peak was barely over a decade ago. There are swimmers faster than Phelps now. But if you said any of them were a greater swimmer than Phelps you‚Äôd be laughed out of the room.</p>

<p>Whoever is elite during their time period should be celebrated. Bob Cousy played against the best people in the world at that time. Every era has faced the best players in the world during those years. No need to downplay any accomplishments.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to sit back and think what those players would do today if they grew up with the nutrition we have, the info we have, the training we have, etc. They would fit in just like they did back then.</p>

<p>If John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek shot 10 3s a game, they would have been the splash brothers back then lol. They both shot 40% so maybe they should have shot more 3s</p>

The question isn&rsquo;t if I could send a modern player back in a time machine 50 years. How would they do in the NBA?   In the case of Jerry West, I think it&rsquo;s more appropriate to say if you took Jerry West as a 5-year-old and had him grow up in today&rsquo;s day and age, would he still have been an elite NBA player with access to the training and nutrition and evolution of the game as it is today and I think unquestionably the answer is still yes.  Taking a crap on players from Bob Cousy&rsquo;s era is lazy, uninformed, and clickbait material.</p>

<p>Russo was dismissing CP3 because he didn&rsquo;t win multiple rings, ignoring that those rings (edit: for Bob Cousy) came in an 8-11 team league where half the league were non-professionals.</p>

<p>The point is that it&rsquo;s harder to win a championship in the 2020&rsquo;s than it was for Boston in the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>If we want to bring up context, Jerry West, Bob Cousy and their peers didn‚Äôt have a million dollars to sink into their physical fitness like LeBron does. Their training facilities weren‚Äôt first class. They played in converse sneakers.</p>

<p>You can think Chris Paul is better than Cousy, maybe he is. But you don‚Äôt have to go out and basically call everybody that played in the 50s and 60s a bum while you do it. JJ‚Äôs free to think how he wants, but people are allowed to think it‚Äôs disrespectful too. Especially the dudes that played in that era.</p>

<p>It is still brought up every time JJ or West are mentioned (a disservice to both, imo)</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t call anyone bums.</p>

<p>He acknowledged the context of the NBA in the 1960s was that there were some professional athletes and some semi-professional athletes.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t call Cousy or West bums. He just noted that the level of competition they faced isn&rsquo;t comparable to the level of competition Chris Paul faced - playing in a league where everyone is a fully trained, full time, professional athlete.</p>

<p>Luka doesn‚Äôt look like an insane professional athlete, but he‚Äôs out here cooking the entire league because he‚Äôs a crafty player. I won‚Äôt disagree with the main point which is that the athleticism and skill level that we see from some dudes today would‚Äôve been incomprehensible back in Bob Cousy‚Äôs day. But athleticism and skill level only shows you the potential for greatness, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily equate to greatness.</p>

<p>And the plumbers and firemen comment, like Jerry West is saying, that doesn‚Äôt mean that they aren‚Äôt professional athletes just because they had to get side jobs in the offseason. Pro basketball players just didn‚Äôt get paid much back in the day. Brittany Griner was a first team all-WNBA player in 2021. Do you think she played in Russia because she was washed or was it because she needed the extra money?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, I get why Jerry West and Bob Cousy told him to pump the brakes and found it disrespectful. And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re alone in that</p>

<p>For many players at that time they had to have an additional occupation to make a reasonable wage.</p>

<p>So a large percentage of NBA players in the 60s were not fully-devoted to working on basketball.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can keep moving the goalposts over and over and over.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not moving any goalposts.  I&rsquo;m acknowledging basketball as it was in the 1960&rsquo;s and as it is in the 2020s.  They are two very different eras that have to be viewed separately in their own context&hellip; Which is the exact point JJ was making.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the plumbers and firemen comment, like Jerry West is saying, that doesn‚Äôt mean that they aren‚Äôt professional athletes just because they had to get side jobs in the offseason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Steph Curry had to work 40 hours a week as a plumber and then come in to compete against Lebron who does nothing but train to play basketball then Curry would be at a massive disadvantage.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t honestly make an argument that a real day job wouldn&rsquo;t make playing in the NBA more difficult or exhausting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, I get why Jerry West and Bob Cousy told him to pump the brakes and found it disrespectful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they got a carefully edited clip that removed all the context.</p>

<p>JJ was not attacking either West or Cousy.  He was simply giving the context they played to counter the old man Chris Russo doing the old man take and hating on current gen Chris Paul.</p>

<p>The actual disrespect in that conversation was toward Chris Paul and that somehow gets glossed over.</p>

      <label for="l8b8hnk" class="commentText"><p>Again, I understand his argument. But he handled it like a jackass. Maybe Chris Russo baited him into it, but the issue is they‚Äôre professional basketball players and he reduced them to plumbers and firemen.  No one‚Äôs saying that he called Cousy that, but he diminished his peers to diminish his accomplishments to support his argument.</p>

<p>Just because some guy‚Äôs being a jackass and disrespecting CP3 doesn‚Äôt make you not a jackass for not only disrespecting Bob Cousy but also disrespecting the league as a whole in an era where several legends that shaped the game played.</p>

<p>Ftr, I like JJ. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an idiot or anything, I just think his tone and perspective was all out of wack on this one and couple of the dudes that played in that generation called him out on it. And if there‚Äôs anyone who we should listen to a rebuttal from it‚Äôs Jerry West, because he was heavily involved in winning basketball from the 60s through the late 2010s.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not diminishing anyone if it&rsquo;s factual that most or even half the league in the 1960s were semi-professionals that had other full-time jobs.</p>

<p>Bob Cousy and Jerry West were greats in their time and Chris Paul was great in his time.</p>

<p>Those two eras shouldn&rsquo;t be directly compared without context.  That was JJ&rsquo;s point.  That is not disrespectful.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t like his tone I don&rsquo;t know what to say other than don&rsquo;t watch any sports debate shows.</p>
