      <label for="lhsbqdo" class="commentText"><p>Come on man Hali is a great young talent and has opportunity to grow but can we stop the comparison of young guys to players like Nash with Hali or MJ with Ant it’s not fair to the young guys it’s basically giving them unreal expectations so you can tear them down later for not meeting them</p>

<p>Nash was a 2 time MVP there are like 15 players in nba history who’ve done that, as well as being a 4 time 50-40-90 player. That’s a really high bar.</p>

<p>I think Hali is a great person and player and I want him to do great things for years to come I just don’t think putting his ceiling at Steve Nash levels is the right thing we should just appreciate him for who he is</p>

      <label for="lhsevgw" class="commentText"><p>Man even at his peak potential hali doesn’t have the same tools that made Nash so special outside of passing. Again this isn’t knocking Hali i love his game but Nash was different. Hali doesn’t have the craftiness/ability to get anywhere on the court he desired like Nash did which is why that Nash probing the defense is so iconic and Steve Nash’s release was much quicker so people had to guard him closer</p>

<p>Hali is a great player with a high ceiling i just don’t agree with it being Steve Nash who was a really special talent</p>

      <label for="lhtf8xb" class="commentText"><p>I think he absolutely has that potential, keep in mind he is only 24 and Steve Nash was a late bloomer. Hali has like 5 years to get there and he&rsquo;s got the ball skills, court vision and shooting numbers to make it possible. Not saying it&rsquo;s most likely going to happen but it definitely isn&rsquo;t unrealistic</p>

      <label for="lhti8o9" class="commentText"><p>I think they’re fundamentally different players and are only being compared because of being high level passers at PG leading high level offenses.</p>

<p>Nash played in an entirely different era and if he played in the current system he’d be putting up insane. Dude shot up to 47% on threes on 5 attempts a game back then and even though he played at a time when pace was slower as now the 7 seconds or less suns wouldn’t have been in the top 20 of pace today this can been evident by Hali already attempting more shots a game than peak Nash</p>

<p>Hali is a great player and has a bright future and this wasn’t even really about him as much as people are underrating Steve Nash</p>
