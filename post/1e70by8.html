</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The summer league isn’t usually any more predictive than any other five game stretch, and to Sarr’s credit he’s averaging 2.5 blocks and 7.7 rebounds. He’s also averaging a solid 3.2 assists for a big man.</p>

<p>However, with all of those disclaimers, what Sarr is doing in the summer league is historic. Even looking at the worst star summer league performances, from Trae Young to Jaylen Brown, they were all scoring twice as much and usually twice as efficiently.</p>

<p>Sarr was always seen as a prospect that would need some development offensively, but it’s possible that he won’t be able to play the role that he envisioned long-term</p>

<p>Used real GM as a source, but it seems like that can’t be linked so here’s a different one: <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/wizards-rookie-alex-sarr-ice-cold-summer-league" target="_blank">https://www.si.com/nba/wizards-rookie-alex-sarr-ice-cold-summer-league</a></p>

<p>He’s a quite good rebounder and has potential on D, he’s mobile and long. His offense however is absolutely beyond woeful, that aspect of his game makes him look like he doesn’t even belong on the court.</p>

<p>But it is summer league, and 7 footers don’t always have an easy transition into the league, so I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Which is <em>boring</em>, I want to spit hot and cold takes prematurely.</p>

<p>This is the overused sentence in every prospect that starts slow but fans want to inhale copium that they still might be good. The difficulty in transitioning to the nba is not limited to 7 footers, guard, or by age. It really is just difficult but there are just few that overcomes that difficulty easily</p>

<p>As far as 7 footers, I don’t know if it’s supported by data, but it seems to me that in this league these days as a big man you’re basically expected to be a versatile offensive wing on top of a defensive presence. There’s generally more riding on them, they’re even expected to shoot threes these days.</p>

<p>One of the early good signs to me is that he’s a good rebounder. People say “lol he’s 7 foot that’s the least he can do” except we’ve seen several examples of bigs who don’t rebound very well.</p>

<p>However when you don’t do those well, then you better have other qualities on the offensive end to offset that. Whether that’s the ability to play like a versatile wing or shooting.</p>

<p>So you can&rsquo;t really say the issue is the transition to the NBA.  The issue is he&rsquo;s just not a good offensive player, at least not yet.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t watch him a ton, but it honestly doesn&rsquo;t seem that bad. He can handle the ball at 7&rsquo; and there are only a handful of legit 7 footers who can do that. He&rsquo;s made some decent passes. His shot just isn&rsquo;t falling and his touch is off.</p>

<p>It seems like he&rsquo;s over thinking everything and just isn&rsquo;t letting the game come to him. Like the ball hits his hands and he pauses reads the defense and is trying to think through what he wants to do before he does it and it just looks mechanical. He just needs to let his feel take over a bit.</p>

<p>He actually reminds me of Jerami Grant a bit. When he was first on the Thunder, he could defend but the offense was a mess. Same thing as with Sarr on offense. Ball hits his hand and it&rsquo;s like a record scratch and everything just stops. He finally figured out that if the other team puts a big on him, he can use a quick move, attack the close out and get to the paint and if it&rsquo;s a wing he can use his size and take it to the post. He didn&rsquo;t have to read the defense or over think it, he just knew it was option A or B the moment he got the ball. After that he started playing with a lot more confidence and was able to work on his 3pt shot.</p>

<p>I think a tall early Jerami Grant is a better comparison because there are those extra skills. Roberson didn&rsquo;t handle the ball, his offense was cutting (good), transition (good), and catch and shoot (very bad).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like the wizards are trying to be good any time soon anyways. He&rsquo;s raw and he&rsquo;ll develop if he&rsquo;s got the right attitude. I wouldn&rsquo;t be that worried.</p>

<p>He’s a bust. Wizards fans will naturally want to deny this fact as they’re rooting for him and he’s important to the success of the franchise</p>

<p>The fact that he was the 2nd pick is genuinely insane, but it’s a garbage draft class for a reason</p>

He&rsquo;s a center who wants to play PF.  His skillset seems to favor being a center.  His shooting isn&rsquo;t good enough at the 4 so he should be a 5.  His passing is great (for a 5).  And his defense is good regardless of position.   He also probably should have a creator who can set him up.  Atlanta mightve been the perfect spot for him if was willing to be a center.</p>

And then offensively all he needs to do is learn the PnR and catch lobs and maybe we could give him some shots here and there to see how he develops.</p>

He wants to be a super max star PF but it doesn’t seem realistic, if he plays his role he could wind up a 20-30m per year center like Claxton or Mobley.</p>

      <label for="ldylfog" class="commentText"><p>I still think he has the potential to do this, he’s so agile and could be an elite switchable defender. But his strong desire to not play center is starting to click after seeing the way he plays in summer league, avoids contact, doesn’t seem to want to drive to the basket, it’s giving real Deandre Ayton vibes but he’s not as good offensively. I think he might be too passive and not physical enough.</p>

<p>If he can accept his role and just play hard defence and catch lobs on offence he’ll be a great center and he has the potential to maybe become a stretch 5 if the right team lets him work on his shot.</p>

      <label for="ldxhk3v" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think he was ever going to live up to the standard of a typical pick #2.  This draft was just awful and nobody in it would go Top 5 in even an average draft year.</p>

<p>So if you change your thinking of Sarr to be more of what you might expect from say, pick #8, I wouldn&rsquo;t jump to bust quite yet.  I think he can very easily be like a Nic Claxton even if his offense never comes around.  Obviously not what you want out of pick #2, but certainly useful.</p>

<p>Hating would be if he said she’s an overrated player. But listing out that she’s a bad finisher around the rim, similar to Sarr, is just comparing two young players.</p>

<p>Why are you getting mad at us for bringing up Reese in a discussion that has nothing to do with her, when you just did the exact same thing with CC</p>

<p>This is a weird hill you’re dying on. No one is hating on anyone. Reese is great, everyone knows she’s great. Not a single comment here said otherwise. If listing a players negative stats is hating, why are you excused for doing just that CC?</p>

Sarr is a bad screener and is bad at catching passes, which are probably the two most important offensive skills for a big playing with Trae.</p>

I think Risacher is a better pick in hindsight and especially with how Sarr doesn’t want to play 5, but if he accepts that role he’ll be a great role player.</p>

As a PF it doesn’t seem likely he stays in league past a bench role unless he makes massive improvements in the next year.</p>

      <label for="ldypqvg" class="commentText"><p>He’s a good defender with potential to be elite, his offence was always the side that was viewed as a project so this makes sense.</p>

<p>The big red flag for me is that he seems to avoid contact and physical play at all costs on top of not wanting to play 5, and if he isn’t willing to do those things then he’s absolutely not worth the #2 pick.</p>
