      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e70by8/alex_sarr_offensive_stats_in_the_summer_league_so/"><p>Alex Sarr offensive stats in the summer league so far: 5.5 ppg, 19% from the field, 11% from three, 50% from the line. .226 TS%, 3.86 PER, 65 offensive rating</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The summer league isn’t usually any more predictive than any other five game stretch, and to Sarr’s credit he’s averaging 2.5 blocks and 7.7 rebounds. He’s also averaging a solid 3.2 assists for a big man.</p>

<p>However, with all of those disclaimers, what Sarr is doing in the summer league is historic. Even looking at the worst star summer league performances, from Trae Young to Jaylen Brown, they were all scoring twice as much and usually twice as efficiently.</p>

<p>Sarr was always seen as a prospect that would need some development offensively, but it’s possible that he won’t be able to play the role that he envisioned long-term</p>

<p>Used real GM as a source, but it seems like that can’t be linked so here’s a different one: <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/wizards-rookie-alex-sarr-ice-cold-summer-league" target="_blank">https://www.si.com/nba/wizards-rookie-alex-sarr-ice-cold-summer-league</a></p>

      <label for="ldwptsq" class="commentText"><p>Saw someone in another thread basically call him Tall Roberson</p>

<p>He’s a quite good rebounder and has potential on D, he’s mobile and long. His offense however is absolutely beyond woeful, that aspect of his game makes him look like he doesn’t even belong on the court.</p>

<p>But it is summer league, and 7 footers don’t always have an easy transition into the league, so I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Which is <em>boring</em>, I want to spit hot and cold takes prematurely.</p>

      <label for="ldwri1f" class="commentText"><p>Sure I’ll spit a hot take.</p>

<p>He’s a bust. Wizards fans will naturally want to deny this fact as they’re rooting for him and he’s important to the success of the franchise</p>

<p>The fact that he was the 2nd pick is genuinely insane, but it’s a garbage draft class for a reason</p>

      <label for="ldwtjc0" class="commentText"><p>We probably need to see him in actual NBA games with better teammates. However, I also think he could&rsquo;ve been drafted in the wrong situation.  He&rsquo;s a center who wants to play PF.  His skillset seems to favor being a center.  His shooting isn&rsquo;t good enough at the 4 so he should be a 5.  His passing is great (for a 5).  And his defense is good regardless of position.   He also probably should have a creator who can set him up.  Atlanta mightve been the perfect spot for him if was willing to be a center.</p>

      <label for="ldwviuf" class="commentText"><p>Yup.. Capela in a garbage team with a garbage PG isn&rsquo;t worth much. But you put Capela alongside Harden, and then Trae with shooters in all other position. He gives you 10ppg without being a blackhole in the offense.</p>

      <label for="ldwrp9c" class="commentText"><p>He had two very cold shooting games, and his shot profile needs to change for now. Everyone knew he was a project, but he had some really nice flashes defensively, has a good handle for his size/age, and is clearly much more fluid than your average big.</p>

<p>The guy just turned 19 in April, raw stats mean very little at this stage of his career</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too early to tell and guys develop a lot in the NBA.  Bit troubling, but he can definitely improve past it, we&rsquo;ll just have to find out if he does.</p>
