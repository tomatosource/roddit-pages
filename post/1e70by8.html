</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The summer league isn’t usually any more predictive than any other five game stretch, and to Sarr’s credit he’s averaging 2.5 blocks and 7.7 rebounds. He’s also averaging a solid 3.2 assists for a big man.</p>

<p>However, with all of those disclaimers, what Sarr is doing in the summer league is historic. Even looking at the worst star summer league performances, from Trae Young to Jaylen Brown, they were all scoring twice as much and usually twice as efficiently.</p>

<p>Sarr was always seen as a prospect that would need some development offensively, but it’s possible that he won’t be able to play the role that he envisioned long-term</p>

<p>Used real GM as a source, but it seems like that can’t be linked so here’s a different one: <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/wizards-rookie-alex-sarr-ice-cold-summer-league" target="_blank">https://www.si.com/nba/wizards-rookie-alex-sarr-ice-cold-summer-league</a></p>

<p>He’s a quite good rebounder and has potential on D, he’s mobile and long. His offense however is absolutely beyond woeful, that aspect of his game makes him look like he doesn’t even belong on the court.</p>

<p>But it is summer league, and 7 footers don’t always have an easy transition into the league, so I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Which is <em>boring</em>, I want to spit hot and cold takes prematurely.</p>

<p>This is the overused sentence in every prospect that starts slow but fans want to inhale copium that they still might be good. The difficulty in transitioning to the nba is not limited to 7 footers, guard, or by age. It really is just difficult but there are just few that overcomes that difficulty easily</p>

<p>As far as 7 footers, I don’t know if it’s supported by data, but it seems to me that in this league these days as a big man you’re basically expected to be a versatile offensive wing on top of a defensive presence. There’s generally more riding on them, they’re even expected to shoot threes these days.</p>

<p>One of the early good signs to me is that he’s a good rebounder. People say “lol he’s 7 foot that’s the least he can do” except we’ve seen several examples of bigs who don’t rebound very well.</p>

<p>However when you don’t do those well, then you better have other qualities on the offensive end to offset that. Whether that’s the ability to play like a versatile wing or shooting.</p>

<p>So you can&rsquo;t really say the issue is the transition to the NBA.  The issue is he&rsquo;s just not a good offensive player, at least not yet.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t watch him a ton, but it honestly doesn&rsquo;t seem that bad. He can handle the ball at 7&rsquo; and there are only a handful of legit 7 footers who can do that. He&rsquo;s made some decent passes. His shot just isn&rsquo;t falling and his touch is off.</p>

<p>It seems like he&rsquo;s over thinking everything and just isn&rsquo;t letting the game come to him. Like the ball hits his hands and he pauses reads the defense and is trying to think through what he wants to do before he does it and it just looks mechanical. He just needs to let his feel take over a bit.</p>

<p>He actually reminds me of Jerami Grant a bit. When he was first on the Thunder, he could defend but the offense was a mess. Same thing as with Sarr on offense. Ball hits his hand and it&rsquo;s like a record scratch and everything just stops. He finally figured out that if the other team puts a big on him, he can use a quick move, attack the close out and get to the paint and if it&rsquo;s a wing he can use his size and take it to the post. He didn&rsquo;t have to read the defense or over think it, he just knew it was option A or B the moment he got the ball. After that he started playing with a lot more confidence and was able to work on his 3pt shot.</p>

<p>I think a tall early Jerami Grant is a better comparison because there are those extra skills. Roberson didn&rsquo;t handle the ball, his offense was cutting (good), transition (good), and catch and shoot (very bad).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like the wizards are trying to be good any time soon anyways. He&rsquo;s raw and he&rsquo;ll develop if he&rsquo;s got the right attitude. I wouldn&rsquo;t be that worried.</p>

<p>He’s a bust. Wizards fans will naturally want to deny this fact as they’re rooting for him and he’s important to the success of the franchise</p>

<p>The fact that he was the 2nd pick is genuinely insane, but it’s a garbage draft class for a reason</p>

      <label for="ldwtjc0" class="commentText"><p>We probably need to see him in actual NBA games with better teammates. However, I also think he could&rsquo;ve been drafted in the wrong situation.  He&rsquo;s a center who wants to play PF.  His skillset seems to favor being a center.  His shooting isn&rsquo;t good enough at the 4 so he should be a 5.  His passing is great (for a 5).  And his defense is good regardless of position.   He also probably should have a creator who can set him up.  Atlanta mightve been the perfect spot for him if was willing to be a center.</p>

      <label for="ldxhk3v" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think he was ever going to live up to the standard of a typical pick #2.  This draft was just awful and nobody in it would go Top 5 in even an average draft year.</p>

<p>So if you change your thinking of Sarr to be more of what you might expect from say, pick #8, I wouldn&rsquo;t jump to bust quite yet.  I think he can very easily be like a Nic Claxton even if his offense never comes around.  Obviously not what you want out of pick #2, but certainly useful.</p>

      <label for="ldxgmer" class="commentText"><p>Have we considered that he might just not be that good, and we could have seen this coming a long way off with his play in the Australian NBL?</p>

<p>It feels like he just got anointed a potential #1 pick in September last year, and nobody really questioned it that much beyond that, even despite not even being a starter or especially impactful player in the NBL.</p>

<p>Nobody hates Bronny James, it’s still the same old Lebron hate fueling these haters. Because for Bronny there never will be excuses, or copium or any fairness in judgement. It’ll always be he’s Lebrons son and Lebron is hated by so many</p>
