      <p>We often debate the greats. I’m talking about the Phil Jacksons, Pat Rileys, Greg Popovich and Steve Kerrs of the world. But who’s the most underrated/under-appreciated coach in the modern era? Erik Spoelstra, Doc Rivers, Mike D’Antoni, George Karl etc etc</p>

      <label for="llnl8uv" class="commentText"><p>Brad Stevens took a team to the playoffs in 2015 the media was saying didn’t have a single starting caliber player.  Ainge was actively trying to tank and Brad was like “nah fuck that.”  The playoff starting lineup was 20 year old Marcus Smart, Avery Bradley, Tyler Zeller, Evan Turner, and Brandon Bass. </p>

<p>Later he had a team in the ECF built around Isaiah Thomas which is wild.  In Brad’s system IT, who previously was seen as a defensive liability microwave off the bench, transformed into a rich man’s Allen Iverson. </p>

<p>Later, all his star players got hurt and he still took a team built around rookie 19 year old Jayson Tatum to the ECF.  They took LeBron to 7 games.  </p>

<p>Covid burnout and injuries got the better of the team and he left his role as coach right before Tatum made his leap into 1st Team All NBA superstardom.  That leap happened at the age superstar leaps generally happen for prospects on that level.  Udoka got to be the beneficiary of that and people foolishly acted like Udoka had turned things around.  Mazzulla took it a step further by being the beneficiary of Brad’s post-Tatum-superstar-leap trades cementing an exceptional roster around the franchise talent.  </p>

<p>But I still think Brad is probably the best coach of the three and is underrated for what he accomplished with very little.  </p>

<p>Great offensive system and player development to get guys a lot of easy buckets and playing their roles well, but he put on a masterclass in dogshit game management in the ECF as well. They easily could’ve taken a game or two sans miscalculations that were squarely on his shoulders</p>

Nowadays he’s commonly seen as the best coach in the league &amp; someone who consistently gets his rosters to exceed expectations. It’s a tragedy he still doesn’t have a COY award.</p>

<p>Since you failed to include him in the initial list of great coaches it’s obvious it’s him. He is above steve kerr in terms of coaching ability by far. The fact that you don’t think so means he is still underrated.</p>

<p>The lob city clippers were never really contenders imo I just never found CP3 or Griffin as a top 5 player in the league which imo is what you need to win a title. He made them competitive but I don’t think they were ever true contenders</p>

<p>The Kawhi/PG clippers I can say he didn’t coach well but tbf what exactly have they done since he left? They reached wcf in a crippled west but that’s about it.</p>

<p>The sixers, no one is taking the sixers to the ecf or finals with an injured star every year (see nick nurse this past season).</p>

<p>I thought he coached extremely well against pacers and was the first coach ever to win a playoff game without his top 2 players and it was against probably our worst matchup. He was also the only coach to hold the pacers under 100 pts and he did it twice in 6 games.</p>

<p>His 3-1 blown leads, first one was his team being an 8th seed against the champs. He should’ve never been up 3-1. The second one iirc cp3 was injured and missed some of those games.</p>

<p>The one in the bubble is the one I think you could definitely pin on him though.</p>

<p>Like I said I don’t think he’s a top coach in the league but this sub saying he’s one of the worst is crazy to me.</p>

      <label for="llntram" class="commentText"><p>Yes so why is the expectation for Kerr to win without one as based on the original comment by that guy ?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair at all.</p>

      <label for="llnuiek" class="commentText"><p>It’s not to win without one it’s to win with a different one like all the other coaches listed have, because Kerr has solely done it with one player while Riley (you said it yourself) had to do it with different superstar players. I’m sure your aware that having a superstar doesn’t mean you get auto championships which is why its more impressive to do it for a long period of time with multiple players. Surely that thought doesn’t seem to out there to you does it?</p>

      <label for="llnwrkh" class="commentText"><p>Eh. I am sure you are aware that his talent pool consisted of Magic Johnson, Kareem, Worthy, Ewing, Shaq and Wade. 9 years as a coach with Lakers, 4 years with knicks and like 11 with Heat.</p>

<p>Your argument here seems to be that over the course of 25 years of coaching he has won 5 rings with multiple cores which is interesting.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily buy it but sure that&rsquo;s one way of looking at it and I suppose that people have their own way of evaluations.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

      <label for="llnxixd" class="commentText"><p>I don’t disagree with anything you said, I mean the only thing really separating Kerr from those coaches is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Winning with different superstars on different teams.</li>
<li>Consistently winning over a long period of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can only accomplish those with more time in the NBA that Kerr needs, it’s not a knock on his current accomplishments just not lobbing him in with the greats instantly. For all we know curry leaves and Kerr never wins a championship again and he was a flash in the pan aka Drose. As opposed to a consistent contender ala Lebron James. For some reason your taking it as a knock against Kerr which is odd.</p>

      <label for="llo5vtg" class="commentText"><p>I think Steve Kerr is actually underrated.  His self-deprecating and &ldquo;Aw, Shucks&rdquo; media personality takes the mystique and respect away that the Phil Jacksons, Pat Rileys and Bill Belichicks have.</p>

<p>Kerr wanted an offense that blended early &lsquo;10s Spurs motion, mid to late &lsquo;00s SSOL Suns, &lsquo;90s pick and roll Jazz and &lsquo;90s Bulls Triangle.</p>

<p>So in the summer of &lsquo;14, he hired Alvin Gentry who coached under D&rsquo;Antoni&rsquo;s Suns to help architect the offense.  The offense emphasized back picks and ball movement which allowed Klay and Steph to create havoc off ball and kept everyone else involved in the offense.</p>

<p>Kerr wanted a grizzled veteran assistant who knew how to make quick defensive adjustments and can call it like it is. So in the summer of &lsquo;14, he hired Ron Adams.</p>

<p>He had Draymond start in the regular season and by the playoffs he was steering the offense.</p>

<p>In the &lsquo;14 season, the Warriors coached by Mark Jackson had a no. 12 ranked offense and and a no. 4 ranked defense with a 51-31 record.</p>

<p>In the &lsquo;15 season, the Warriors coached by Steve Kerr had a no. 1 ranked offense and a no. 1 ranked defense with a 67-15 record.</p>

<p>If Kerr had slicked back hair with Armani suits or had a beard and smoked sage while talking about mysticism, he would be seen as a visionary.</p>

<p>But since he pokes fun at himself like he was a blonde Conan O&rsquo;Brien, people don&rsquo;t take him as seriously as they should.</p>

Riley hasnt won without Kareem and Magic, both of who are greater and better than Steph as well as Wade and Shaq. Jackson won with MJ, the greatest player ever and Shaq and Kobe. None of these guys won with bums, in fact they all won with better players than Steph aside from 1 of Pat Riley&rsquo;s rings.</p>

<p>Joe Mazz is really good too, he often gets underrated because there is a perception that he inherited Brad Stevens/Ime Udoka’s teams but he really made the team his own during their championship run. Listen to his interviews and you can easily tell how incessantly obsessed this dude is at basketball.</p>
