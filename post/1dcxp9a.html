      <label for="l848yf3" class="commentText"><p>Dereck, as an avid Lego collector, what is your favorite set that you have? Any you have your eyes on? What about building Legos interests you. Is it just a build distraction from all the constant pressure? a mindfulness practice? I myself love to solve puzzles when I&rsquo;m getting a bit overwhelmed with life and it helps me center myself. If someone were looking to get into building lego sets what are the easier ones to start with? And if I may ask one more. Who has the better collection, You or Myles. Much love brotha</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Also, do you parallels between basketball and chess?</p>

<p>And hello D Live! How much of an impact do you think a finals appearance in one&rsquo;s rookie season has, moving forward. Not only have you seen significant minutes in these playoff games, but also been integral to the success of your team with incredible performance. How much of it (whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo; is, be it confidence, or more basketball knowledge from playing in a different format) do you think will make you stand out among your peers in the upcoming regular season?</p>

<p>Good luck for game 3!</p>

Obviously I loved Jordan but my favorite Bull was actually Ron Harper. I loved his tenacity and felt like we had similar games since I was more hustle than anything…At least that is what I was thinking in my 9 year old head :). BUT my favorite PLAYER growing up was actually Gary Payton. I had a poster of him on my wall because I loved his defensive prowess and really wanted my defense to stand out like him. -Cassidy</p>

I loved the response but all I said was “WOW” lol I then doubled down and asked “That is what fueled the comeback?” and he said “sure” with the straight faced sarcasm Jalen is known for…I WISH I would’ve asked if that fan was Stephen A since he was sitting courtside but I just moved on to asking about the rest of the game. There are often a lot of shoulda coulda wouldas in postgame interviews but overall I thought that was a fun and memorable interaction. -Cassidy</p>

      <label for="l85gavo" class="commentText"><p>This season I was really impressed with Anthony Edwards in how he handled his media sessions. He was authentic and allowed fans and those who covered him to understand more of who he is, what makes him tick and we are always looking for players and coaches to keep it real and he did that throughout this playoff run. While some people may have had an issue with him saying he was “tired” after game 1 of the WCF… I appreciated that response more than him putting up a front….. I think Ant has shown what is making him a star is being himself. </p>

<p>I also appreciate the growth and maturity that Jayson Tatum has shown this playoff run. -Cassidy</p>

<p>I feel the same way. I’ve had a few conversations with others enjoying Edwards’ responses. Anyone could take away something from his interviews (casual fans to diehard basketball fans)</p>

<p>The attention given to Tatum has been ridiculous. I’m happy to see it not bother him as he always has and focus on what the Celtics need. I have a lot of respect for him</p>

      <label for="l858hrn" class="commentText"><p>The biggest advice I give aspiring journalists is to make sure you’re paying attention to where media is going. I was able to take advantage of a changing landscape as social media was just launching when I was in college. I was taking interest in how social media impacted how people consumed sports and engaged in trends daily. Doing so helped me find opportunities in the field and become a valuable asset to employers who were trying to understand the space. Fast forward now almost 20 years, media hasn’t stopped changing and employers are still trying to understand how young people consume and engage with sports content. Find ways to make yourself as valuable as possible by teaching yourself as much about the business with the same amount of passion as being a fan of your favorite sports team. -Cassidy</p>

It was a Christmas Day game in Houston so I got him after the first quarter and they were losing so needless to say he wasn’t in the Christmas spirit. I got through it though by letting him know I would only ask him one question as a Christmas gift. I got a small smirk out of him as he walked away which I will always take as a win.</p>

<p>In terms of players, as a newbie reporter I was always a little nervous asking Russell Westbrook questions but I now look back on those times and laugh since Russ has been really great to work with over my career. I just let a few memes get in my head in the early days. -Cassidy</p>

<p>I wish there was some secret way to stay poised regardless but I know I feel at my best when I am not scrambling or my attention is divided 15 different ways….which i have to admit is usually how I am. Given that I am a national reporter, typically, I am flying into a different city every week, playing a bit of catchup up on teams compared to the beat reporters who see their teams and players day in and day out. So the best thing I can do is to continue to read whatever I can about the league every day and watch as many games as possible on a given night. That way when I am at the game I have built-in knowledge of the storylines to build off of and I can just focus on what is happening between the lines which allows me to ask more pointed and informed questions. I wish I felt more prepared probably 95% of the time but I am also a perfectionist so that’s just my blessing/curse. -Cassidy</p>

TBH there are very few people who are not nervous when speaking in front of people (let alone national TV) and preparation is often the best way to have something to fall back on. Not many of us are naturally charismatic/engaging a la Dave Chapelle so the rest of us normal people have to prep to build up that base of confidence</p>

<p>Lastly who is your Finals pick &amp; in how many games?</p>

      <label for="l85ny9w" class="commentText"><p>I am traveling typically every week, if not twice a week. The playoffs are a different beast compared to the regular season. Regular season though, I like to try and fly in for a practice or shootaround to get access to players so that means I would travel in the day before a game and then leave the day after. So typically a 48 hour stretch over 3 days. I cover a lot of east coast games during the regular season since I am east cost based. I find myself in Boston a lot and Phlly since both teams tend to have a lot of national televised games. The Knicks having a lot of success this year was helpful for my travel schedule since that’s really a home game for me as well. I actually covered my FIRST Magic game in Orlando this postseason. Surprisingly almost 10 years on the sidelines I hadn’t had the privilege of being in Orlando for a game and it really was worth the wait I guess. That crowd and atmosphere during the playoffs was incredible. The in arena entertainment was also unique and creative which is saying a lot since I’ve seen my fair share of in arena tricks. </p>

<p>Celtics in 7 was my original prediction.</p>

<p>Still holding out hope for a long and entertaining series.- Cassidy</p>

      <label for="l841cr9" class="commentText"><p>Hello, why do you think NBA discourse in social media is so much worse than that of other sports? I feel like we see far too much of an obsession with ranking players as opposed to literally anything else. We also see that, when players play bad, fans and media tend to chalk players’ poor performance to “choking” instead of analyzing WHY their performance was poor. For instance, NBA discourse would be so much better if we talked about tangible adjustments that coaches make to give their team a better shot to win instead of focusing on intangibles such as “dawg” and whatnot.</p>

Basketball is a team sport with so many variables outside of individual performance, but collective team performance seems to play a disproportionate role in individual rankings. AKA, NBA discourse from a fish eye’s view is like how folks treat individual sports.</p>

      <label for="l845f5q" class="commentText"><p>Jaylen!! It&rsquo;s been awesome watching you for the past 8 years. Celtics future truly changed when you came on board. 6 trips to the Conference Finals in 8 years, as well as 2 Finals appearances and things are only getting better. Thank you!!!</p>

<p>Anyway, I feel as though you have made the leap from a good decision-maker to truly great one this year. Whether it be rim reads, when to attack, when to pass, etc. I feel like you&rsquo;ve improved. I think some data supports that with you getting fewer touches due to all the talent on the team, but with things like impact metrics saying you&rsquo;ve been the most impactful you&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>

<p>My question is this, what do you think has most helped you with your decision making on the court? Is it experience? Teammates being in better positions themselves? Coaches preparing you differently? A way you trained in the off-season?</p>

<p>PS: It&rsquo;s BS you didn&rsquo;t get All-NBA or All-Defensive team</p>

<p><strong>My question</strong>: I am curious at what point you had a strong feeling that the NBA was within reach for your story? Was it a game, a conversation, or simply when you were drafted?</p>

<p>I have a 6 year old and he loves basketball, he&rsquo;s a major Celtics fan. He talks about playing in the NBA, not sure that&rsquo;s in his cards, but would love to share your answer with him.</p>

<p><strong>Most importantly, Boston/New England love you, thank you for everything my guy! Also thanks for the High-5 after the Hornets Pre-season game back in 2022.</strong></p>

Your jumper, finishing, attacking, defense on and off the ball and most recently your ability to play in traffic and playmake are all levels above where they were even just a few years ago.</p>

<p>What has allowed you to gradually improve from a player that people thought was a giant reach in the draft to a player that has been in the All-NBA conversation for the past few years (and hopefully many more)?</p>

      <label for="l84hf88" class="commentText"><p>Jaylen, when you got your contract, it came with life changing money for virtually anyone. While I would have been devastated as a fan, personally I don&rsquo;t think I could have blamed you if you coasted on your physical prowess and focused on spending money and explore vices.</p>

<p>Instead, year after year, you&rsquo;ve shown tremendous improvement in all aspects of the game, and it has been a pleasure to watch you play and cheer as a fan.</p>

<p>Some may think the contract has proven that FCHWPO(faith, consistency, hard work pays off), and is the result of the mindset. What gives you the drive to work even harder when you&rsquo;ve already been rewarded a prize that most people only dream of? Do you look for external motivators to keep you going, or do you think it&rsquo;s something internal?</p>

<p>Wish you the best on the court and in life. Go Celtics!</p>

As someone not from the broadcasting/reporting world, I only have limited knowledge of what really needs to happen to make a successful production. What would you say is the least glamorous part of your work? Continue producing the awesome interviews and content!</p>

<p>Jaylen/Dereck: How nervous do you guys get before a big playoff game and what do you do calm your nerves? Both of you have been great defensively throughout the postseason. What do you think makes you so effective defensively? What do you guys think is the best way to develop your defense instincts, like understanding coverages or when to rotate? Is it film study, practice sessions, or something else? Best of luck to you both.</p>

      <label for="l854gpi" class="commentText"><p>Hello, Mr. Jaylen Brown! Lifelong Celtics fan. After Game 2, Coach Mazzulla talked about how everybody does the important things to affect the game in different ways — not just score — and that this was Celtics Basketball. In line with that, Jrue Holiday called himself a &ldquo;utility guy.&rdquo; Would you also consider Jayson Tatum to be a utility guy&hellip;but maybe an <strong><em>elite</em></strong> utility guy on a team of utility guys? Lastly, Coach Mazzulla had also said that Jayson Tatum &ldquo;makes greatness look easy.&rdquo; What exactly does that mean when even layups looked difficult for him in Game 2? To me, it all looks like hard work and effort out there&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks for taking my questions!</p>

      <label for="l856tts" class="commentText"><p>Could we see a 2 big lineup for the mavs in the near-future? Using you (Lively) as a spacer and Gafford as the roller? It looks like Lively can hold his own on the perimeter, the only question is can you shoot 3s in game because the jumpshot looks pure in practice. This gives you guys a really nice defensive presence to pack the paint, and would also minimize mismatches that Boston brings when they try to hunt for KP mismatches.</p>
