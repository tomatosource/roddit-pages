      <label for="ljzz0a8" class="commentText"><p>Before the 2003 season, Anthony Carter was supposed to have his player option picked up for like $4 million. But his agent &ldquo;forgot&rdquo;. His agent reportedly spent like 15 years paying him back.</p>

<p>The Heat, thanks to not having Carter, were able to sign Lamar Odom. It was a franchise altering move, as Odom thrived, and then they were able to flip him to LA for Shaq.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even remotely buy it. Bill Duffy is a highly qualified agent and that was a gigantic mistake to make. I genuinely believe the Heat paid off Duffy and/or Carter to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; to accept the option so that they could sign Odom, and they&rsquo;ve been the beneficiary of that cheating for the subsequent two decades. </p>

Allegedly the reason Haslem was on the bench so long wasn&rsquo;t b/c of his &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; but because he pulled a Joe Smith and took a paycut so that the org could sign the Big Three. The prolonged locker room presence was just them repaying him back the contract he would&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>

<p>It’s reality. He had a huge, massive public offer from the Mavs that he turned down to stay in Miami for the “culture” (and he is from that area so it’s meaningful to him). BUT Pat Riley promised Udonis he would make nearly all the money he left on the table back by keeping him on the end of the bench and giving him a front office job for life. The owner agreed.</p>

<p>Also not quite a Joe Smith. I’m under the impression you’re allowed (at least in the “nobody talks to free agents until it’s allowed” sense) to let a player know you will take care of them down the road. Happens all the time just not quite to this extent.</p>

<p>Joe Smith was getting paid outside of the salary cap. Haslem recouped his money on the cap.</p>

<ul>
<li>playing basketball is a very squeaky experience</li>
<li>when playing there’s really no way to tell which shoe is causing which squeak. People saying the sounds “don’t match” can’t watch 20 feet at once</li>
<li>NBA courts are way cleaner than casual gym and will be even squeakier</li>
<li>the squeaky sound is annoying if anything, why pipe it in?</li>
<li>can we just compare a fan video to a broadcast and confirm/deny this real quick? Keep in mind the speed of sound is important here so the audio tracks won’t match perfectly but the pattern should be consistent.</li>

If one of them&rsquo;s card wasn&rsquo;t letting them get it out (probably since Marcus was playing for either the Pistons or Celtics back then and might have pinged as a fraud alert) his brother might have let him since they thought no one would notice the difference. I didn&rsquo;t say anything because you trying accusing an NBA player he is actually his twin brother!</p>

<p>LeBron stays home for the Cavs</p>

<p>After LeBron left the Cavs, they somehow get 3 1st overall picks in 4 years to build their talent base while LeBron is away</p>

<p>New Orleans gets the #1 pick for AD right as the NBA was trying to sell the team</p>

<p>Wemby conveniently lands in the absolute best spot for his development in a year where all the other tanking teams were long-term dysfunctional trash franchises.</p>

      <label for="lk05ode" class="commentText"><p>With that being said, there are some instances where it would have made sense for the NBA to rig the draft but they didn’t. Most notably is the 2019 draft, where everyone was talking about how box-office it would be if the Knicks (who had the best lottery odds) got to draft Zion. However, the Pelicans ended up winning that lottery over the Knicks (and the Knicks even fell out of the top 2 meaning they wouldn’t get Ja either).</p>

<p>The 2019 draft lottery pretty much solidified in my mind that the draft lottery is not rigged, at least not in the past 15 years or so. I can’t really speak to before that.</p>

<p>Same with Memphis getting Ja. It’s just crazy to me that two small market teams that would have absolutely died without a top pick happened to get one.</p>

<p>NBA makes more money by keeping those two small market teams alive than giving New York Zion</p>

      <label for="lk088pc" class="commentText"><p>I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that lebron is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.</p>

<p>I am dead serious. I believe lebron was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into gloria james and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he&rsquo;s very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 18 years old? it&rsquo;s un-natural. how often have TV analysts described him as a &ldquo;freak of nature&rdquo; &hellip;..maybe it&rsquo;s truer than we know.</p>

<p>I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that lebron&rsquo;s mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it&rsquo;s just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.</p>

<p>and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in &ldquo;experiments.&rdquo; read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s.</p>

<p>I believe that lebron was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like &ldquo;well let&rsquo;s test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this.&rdquo;
it&rsquo;s not all that crazy. you don&rsquo;t think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it&rsquo;s been documented. you don&rsquo;t think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that&rsquo;s why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say &ldquo;look at this, you don&rsquo;t wanna fund this on a larger scale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>and where else would such a person end up besides in a professional sports league?</p>

<p>I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like lebron, younger than him probably. if they couldn&rsquo;t see how well the experiment worked until he was about 16-18 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 16 and could have came off the bench for any NBA team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like lebron (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret barracks right now&hellip;..</p>

<p>until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..</p>

<p>edit: something I&rsquo;d like to add in case someone says &ldquo;well if this is true why wouldn&rsquo;t lebron&rsquo;s mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and lebron was the result.&rdquo; well she doesn&rsquo;t know. it&rsquo;s simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she&rsquo;s in a haze and doesn&rsquo;t remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she&rsquo;s pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has lebron. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.</p>

      <label for="lk1niu1" class="commentText"><p>There was something like this in Maryland High School basketball a few years ago. Big Jimmy Sorunke. A 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; West African guy showed up out of nowhere and enrolled at a public high school as a freshman. Claimed he was 15 or 16 and never played organized basketball before. He led the state in blocked shots and rebounds and took his school to the Quarterfinals.</p>

<p>Then it comes out that he&rsquo;s at least 20 years old. People dug up his identity and matched him to a semi-pro player in Africa. Plus they found pictures of him at an 18+ tournament in his home country. The next year he reclassified as a senior and eventually transfered to a prep school in Indiana. Last I saw he was a Junior at Bowie State University here in Maryland.</p>

<p>I remember stuff like this happening before around the country. But it was wild to see it all happen not far from me.</p>

      <label for="ljzzgwu" class="commentText"><p>1985 nba draft was rigged so the Knicks could get the number 1 pick and select Patrick Ewing.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bX1kMlG8c7Y?si=slttOMr3WuBRXoME" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/bX1kMlG8c7Y?si=slttOMr3WuBRXoME</a></p>

<p>The NBA was struggling to fund themselves in the 1980’s as they were about to lose their CBS contract and the leagues biggest names were retiring. This caused the NBA to challenge the integrity and moral of sports and rig the biggest event for college basketball players up to this point. The NBA wanted a large market team to land college basketball’s biggest star at the time - Ewing.</p>

<p>“There is a strong feeling among league officials and television advertising executives,” The New York Times wrote, “that the NBA will benefit most if (Ewing) winds up in a Knicks uniform.”</p>

<p>The rigging was less about the Knicks working together with the NBA but more about the NBA wanting Patrick to play on a team that would draw in fans, sell tickets, cement tv deals and rake in money for the league.</p>

<p>The 7 teams in that drum were Knicks, Pacers, Clippers, Sonics, Hawks, Kings and Warriors.</p>

<p>It’s obvious why they wanted Ewing to land in New York in 1985.</p>

      <label for="lk02ewj" class="commentText"><p>Yep and/or damaged envelope. All the envelopes were placed gently into the tumbler apart from the one that contained the NYK. That envelope got bashed against the side and folded/dented a corner of the card… Guess which envelope got picked by Stern? You guessed it!</p>

<p>Also, Stern looks unbelievably nervous throughout and does a deep sigh before picking.</p>

<p>Anyway, regardless of all that the Knicks never got passed the Bulls and the rest is history.</p>

      <label for="lk036kt" class="commentText"><p>This actually got disproven in a youtube vid iirc. They tried putting the envelope into the fridge overnight, but unfortunately, paper doesn&rsquo;t really retain the coolness to the touch even once you put in in the globe thing they used.</p>

<p>The way they could possibly have &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; this was probably by creasing the envelope. If you rewatch the lottery, it was a little sketchy on how a specific envelope got creased. David Stern can even be seen fishing for a specific envelope once he put his arm in on the thing.</p>

<p>Former Sixers GM Bryan Colangelo and/or his wife had a secret burner Twitter account in which they would argue with players on their own team, attack anybody who made fun of Colangelo’s collar (a popular joke at the time was that he wore shirts with weirdly oversized collars). Somebody on Twitter, through some incredible amateur investigative journalism, found out it was Colangelo and/or his wife, and Colangelo actually resigned.</p>

Personally, I just think Jordan had such an obsessive need to win that if it looked like he was at the peak and it was only down hill after, he bowed out. I think Jordan was truly afraid of losing on the biggest stage, especially during his peak.</p>

      <label for="lk051c6" class="commentText"><p>While this may be true, it is not the most egregious &ldquo;rigging&rdquo; for the Tim Donahue/David Stern era. It&rsquo;s the more popular of the two because everyone loves talking about the Lakers AND because if the other one is true (it is) then it would completely change the legacy of one of the most beloved characters in NBA history: Bubba Chuck, erm&hellip;I mean, Allen Iverson.</p>

<p>The 2001 Milwaukee Bucks with the offensive big three of Ray Allen, Glen Robinson and Sam Cassell were robbed of a finals appearance to play against Shaq, Kobe and the Lakers. A roster that was surprisingly deep included a young Michael Redd and &ldquo;Skip to my Lou&rdquo; Rafer Alston before they were good enough to get minutes.</p>

<p>Both George Karl and Ray Allen were fined some hefty chunks of change for calling this out in real time which was a smart move by Business man David Stern who may not have caught onto Tim Donahue&rsquo;s schemes yet but also was happy to turn a blind eye to anything that would get the most popular players in the world into the big show down NBA finals.</p>

<p>Related but unrelated&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>People forget how Iverson and the sixers were a missed Vince Carter shot and an evenly officiated series away from never reaching the finals. If either of those things came true and Allen failed to ever have any significant playoff success while in Philadelphia would people still think so highly of him?</p>

<p>Whenever the arguments are made against A.I and how his style doesn&rsquo;t amount towards winning in the same way of the all time greats he&rsquo;s compared to or that he wasn&rsquo;t good enough to be the best player on a championship team the counterargument is just to reference the 2001 playoff run.</p>

<p>Anyways, &ldquo;If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we&rsquo;d all have a Merry Christmas&rdquo; BUT this series was absolutely disgusting and will make any Bucks fans stomach hurt if you happen to have access to the series and rewatch. The NBA has done a great job at taking down any footage online for both this series and the one OP mentioned.</p>

      <label for="lk183mt" class="commentText"><p>So many hangover things lurking under the surface in prior eras of pro sports. I mean, it’s still there, but it’s obviously nowhere near as prevalent.</p>

<p>Baseball had many dozens of “DNP - flu like symptoms” per season in the 90s, and it mysteriously happened way more often in day games on the road.</p>

<p>See also some NFL players being inexplicably <em>so</em> much worse on the road, and the plausible inference that some of them are just alcoholics who have a harder time staying sober on the road.  I can 100% get behind a half-baked theory that Ben Roethlisberger spent most of his road games working off 5 drinks on the preceding Saturday night.</p>

<p>Balmer paid half a billion for the Forum and the land rights to build Inuit Dome. That land was marked for affordable housing for decades and the only way to get it for commercial reasons was with the mayor&rsquo;s help. Who wants to bet that Mayor Butts pockets are a little fatter nowadays? It&rsquo;s not like the guy got caught in a scandal paying his mistress secretary 200k + whatever he would offload to her to stash for him.. oh wait. He did. </p>

<p>Lol there&rsquo;s a juicy story in Inglewood but no one seems to want to write it.. </p>

      <label for="ljzzgwf" class="commentText"><p>The NBA is still rigged.</p>

<p>Not that games are ACTUALLY rigged, with the players in on it, outcomes predetermined and everything….I just fully buy the possibility that the NBA gives the refs an idea of the way they’d prefer games to be called depending on the matchup, and the way the game is called is to benefit whichever team they would like to see win. From there it’s up to that team to take advantage. To add even more; timely foul calls to stop runs and getting a role player in foul trouble that a team desperately needs.</p>

<p>Gilbert Arenas has talked about this and so has Tim Donaghy. I know Donaghy is a clown, but the NBA doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt after how they handled his entire situation. The fact Scott Foster is still employed should have everybody skeptical</p>

It’s impossible to be certain (or even confident) that Lebron would be severely effected by that, or that he would be the only one even remotely effected by it. He did have a history of cramping up in games, sure, but not to the level of “if we turn off the a/c, he will for sure cramp up and no one else will and this will only have positive effects for our team.”</p>

      <label for="lk0opw0" class="commentText"><p>I also think a conspiracy is that certain teams and players are officiated differently not for $ but because of the human element.  The referees are manipulated by players through their game, their words, and their star level.  If James Harden shoots an airball the ref will call a foul because they&rsquo;re expecting something must&rsquo;ve caused that airball, so they go off their assumptions rather than what they saw.  Same with Lebron giving their kids autographs, Draymond yelling in their face, Chris Paul being head of the player&rsquo;s union, etc. etc.</p>

Naturally in game 3 the first foul on Yao is a, you guessed it, a moving screen. Rockets lose the series, Van Gundy goes to the media and says that a ref told him the league wanted the Mavs to have a more lenient whistle. Stern goes nuclear on Jeff and fines him a quarter mill iirc. I’m going mostly by memory.</p>

The league saw young Dwade as a possible face of the NBA and the heat were way sexier than the boring, Euro-led mavs. I 100% believe this conspiracy.</p>

      <label for="lk0pp78" class="commentText"><p>I think ESPN told it&rsquo;s on air talent to all pick the Mavericks in this years finals to get more people to bet. Vegas had the Celtics as huge favorites, nearly every stat showed the C&rsquo;s being a far better team, and yet nearly every talking head picked the Mav&rsquo;s. They are either really bad at their jobs or their job was to get more people to bet on the Mav&rsquo;s. ESPN has a conflict of interest since it owns shares in sport betting companies.</p>

<p>2002 Lakers - Kings series was rigged. That championship should have an asterisk for the Lakers.  The Lakers shot 27 free throws in the 4th quarter of game 6. That&rsquo;s was just insane. The call at the end when Kobe runs over Bibby who wasn&rsquo;t even moving at the time was crazy. Everyone in the arena was celebrating at first because they assumed the call would be against Kobe but instead it was called against Bibby for standing in the wrong place.</p>

<p>2006 Heat vs Mavericks series was even worse. I think Cuban must have done something to piss off the refs because they were calling everything that series. The Mavs basically weren&rsquo;t allowed to play defense. That was the worst NBA finals ever. Wade dribbling for most of the shot clock, throw up a prayer, shoot free throws, repeat over and over.</p>
