</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now that the Olympics are behind us, it&rsquo;s time to look ahead to the 2024-25 season.</p>

<p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to preview each team (grouped by <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake" target="_blank">tiers</a> ). In terms of predictions, we&rsquo;re going to avoid hot takes or bold predictions for the sake of drama and simply go with the most realistic outcome. The truth of the matter is: the biggest differentiator between expected success and results tends to be injury related, so it&rsquo;s difficult to peer into the crystal ball on that front. We&rsquo;re also going to balance every team&rsquo;s wins to be an even .500 across the league, which is something most outlets don&rsquo;t bother to do.</p>

<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s cast a look at the pecking order in the <strong>WESTERN CONFERENCE.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>TIER TWO: DANGEROUS OLD DOGS</strong></p>

<p><strong>(5) PHOENIX SUNS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>49-33</strong>, +3.0 point differential, # 6 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 9th on offense, 13th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: In terms of injuries, the Suns were mixed last year. Bradley Beal missed 29 games &ndash; but Kevin Durant only missed 7. That may start to even out. In terms of shooting outliers, Grayson Allen&rsquo;s 46.1% from three will probably drop some regardless of what NBA2k says. Roughly <strong>48 wins</strong> may have been an expected result with last season&rsquo;s roster.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SG Eric Gordon, C Drew Eubanks</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: coach Mike Budenholzer, PG Tyus Jones, PG Monte Morris, C Mason Plumlee, SF Ryan Dunn &reg;</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Losing Eric Gordon hurts a <em>little</em>, but the team is deepest at the SG spot. Their depth was more questionable elsewhere. Rather than relying on point-Booker, the Suns brought in not one but TWO true point guards in Tyus Jones and Monte Morris. They&rsquo;re both long-time favorites of mine given their steady play and basketball IQ. Having a decent backup center like Mason Plumlee should help at the margins as well.</p>

<p>From a coaching perspective, veteran Mike Budenholzer will hopefully coax the team to massage their shot distribution. Despite all the shooters on the roster, the Suns finished 25th in three-point attempts. It&rsquo;s an issue that&rsquo;s plagued virtually all of Kevin Durant&rsquo;s teams; as great as he is in the midrange, he&rsquo;d even more effective if he added more threes to his shot diet.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>Phoenix has a <span class="math inline">\(220M roster -- \)</span>50M of which is tied up in <strong>Bradley Beal</strong>. When they made that move, they expected him to average more than 18.2 points per game (and 16.5 in the playoffs). They expected him to play better than Grayson Allen. Neither happened. It was an embarrassing return for a max player who&rsquo;s still only 31. It&rsquo;s difficult to see Beal carving out a role that maximizes his skills here (given all the guards on the roster), but he needs to step up as a reliable and uber-efficient third banana. If he can, this team should crack the top 5 in offensive rating.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The Phoenix Suns are going to be undersized and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; (for a lack of a better word), but their offensive talent should still enable them to go <strong>48-34</strong> barring major injuries. If they&rsquo;re going to do much better than that, then they need one of their young forwards (Ryan Dunn or Oso Ighodaro) to play a role. I didn&rsquo;t list them as swing players though because it&rsquo;d be asking a lot for a rookie.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>You can find an over/under of 46.5 on most sites, which makes me inclined to <strong>bet a little on the OVER</strong>. There&rsquo;s some messiness with this roster, but Devin Booker is about as reliable of a rock as you can find given his skill set and his age.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(6) GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>46-36</strong>, +2.6 point differential, # 10 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 8th in offense, 15th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: Was the fact that Draymond Green missed 27 games a matter of poor luck? Or should we expect more of the same? I guess there should be some expectation that aging stars like Green or Stephen Curry will miss time, be it injury or insanity related. So with that, <strong>46 wins</strong> feels like a fair outcome from last season&rsquo;s roster.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SG Klay Thompson, PG Chris Paul, PF Dario Saric</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SF De&rsquo;Anthony Melton, SG Buddy Hield, PF Kyle Anderson</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an emotional gut punch to seeing Klay Thompson leave, but it&rsquo;s less of a concern from a basketball perspective. The team has shooting guards ready to step up in Brandin Podziemski and Moses Moody, and will now bring in De&rsquo;Anthony Melton and Buddy Hield to boot. A bigger concern would be the depth at PG if Steph Curry misses any time because they don&rsquo;t have a reliable backup like Chris Paul to carry the load anymore.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>New wing <strong>De&rsquo;Anthony Melton</strong> could make a name for himself this year. Melton missed 40+ games with back problems for Philly last year, but he&rsquo;s always been an effective 3+D wing who plays bigger than his listed size given his long wingspan. The Warriors won the title in &lsquo;22 with a small lineup that played &ldquo;big&rdquo; with extra energy and rebounding, and they have some of that potential here with Melton and Podziemski and 6&rsquo;9&rdquo; center Trayce Jackson-Davis.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>As long as Steph Curry stays healthy, I like the Warriors chances of roaring back into the playoffs and finishing with a <strong>45-37</strong> record. Their depth is better than it&rsquo;s been in several years.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The Warriors are listed at 43.5, which to me feels like an overreaction to Klay Thompson&rsquo;s departure. I&rsquo;d encourage to <strong>bet the OVER</strong> here.</p>
