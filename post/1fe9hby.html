      <p>In the NFL there are a lot of Cinderella stories which turned into Hollywood movies like American Underdog with Kurt Warner winning the Super Bowl and MVP in his 1999 season. Invincible with Vince Papale. Tom Brady as 199th pick and turning into the üêê.</p>

<p>What is an NBA player Cinderella story?</p>

      <label for="lmll5r6" class="commentText"><p>Iverson&rsquo;s family was evicted from their home and he had a single mother. Iverson was also arrested and spent 4 months in jail before he went to a high school for at-risk-youth where his basketball skills eventually got noticed.</p>

<p>Serge Ibaka had no electricity or water and grew up with his grandmother during the Second Congo War. His mom died and his father was in prison for 7 years.</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler&rsquo;s father abandon the family when he was an infant and his mother kicked him out of her house when he was 13.</p>

<p>There are a lot of players that came from poverty, like Lebron, Carmelo, Durant, Ben Wallace, Pippen, Giannis, etc.</p>

<p>Some of the best 2nd Round picks: Jokic, Ginobili, Draymond Green, Rodman, and Isaiah Thomas.</p>

<p>Undrafted players: Ben Wallace, Connie Hawkins, John Starks, Bruce Bowen, Jeremy Lin, Fred Van Vleet, and Brad Miller</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If I had to pick one of these guys, it&rsquo;d probably be Ben Wallace:</p>

<ol>
<li>One of 11 siblings living in a 3 bedroom home. His family never had a car. They didn&rsquo;t have electricity for a long time. His mom made all their clothes</li>
<li>He originally went to a community college and then went to a Division II school</li>
<li>He was undrafted</li>
<li>Went overseas to play ball after going undrafted and played in one game</li>
<li>He is one of the faces of the 2004 Pistons, which is the most Cinderella team of all-time</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s one of the greatest defenders in NBA history</li>
</ol>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a Charles Oakley storyline where Wallace paid his own registration fee to go to Oakley&rsquo;s basketball camp by cutting people&rsquo;s hair. Oakley became his mentor at the camp and eventually helped Wallace get onto basketball teams at the community college and the Division II university he went to. (Fairy Godfather?)</p>

<p>Wow 8 inch growth spurt after high school and basically didn&rsquo;t seriously consider basketball until he started playing at a community college at 22 years old and was drafted at 25.</p>

I‚Äôm from the 757 and I‚Äôm close to their ages. Curry was an All-American in FB and BB too. Won 3 straight HS FB state titles and a HS BB state title. Bubbachuck got into a bowling alley fight that he ended up getting locked up for it. John Thompson threw him a life line and the rest is history. He had the typical hood story, didn‚Äôt know his dad, mom on drugs, poverty.</p>

More of a rare talent as a hooper but if he played football he maybe could‚Äôve won a couple of championships in his prime. That mf could throw the hell out of the ball.

      <label for="lmmiz7l" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think these are really the kind of Cinderella stories that OP is talking about. The majority of these are just rags to riches stories, the NFL has those a dime a dozen too but we don&rsquo;t call them Cinderella stories. I mean cmon bro, <em>LEBRON</em> is not a Cinderella story just because he didn&rsquo;t grow up with money - he was crowned &ldquo;the chosen one&rdquo; by a national magazine before he had a hs diploma.</p>

<p>A Cinderella story is someone who is looked over or considered unimpressive proving themselves. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella" target="_blank">The word Cinderella has, by analogy, come to mean someone whose attributes are unrecognized, or someone unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect. In the world of sports, &ldquo;a Cinderella&rdquo; is used for an underrated team or club winning over stronger and more favored competitors.</a> There&rsquo;s a difference between the rags to riches stories and Cinderella stories. Tom Brady grew up affluent and is a Cinderella story for example. Jeremy Lin would be a better example of a Cinderella story.</p>

He was such a late bloomer that he didn&rsquo;t even play college ball right away and was working as a janitor at an airport. He had a <em>really</em> late growth spurt and decided to go back to junior college and eventually caught enough attention to be drafted by the Pistons in the second round. Because of his late start, he was 25 as a rookie, but he went on to be the greatest rebounder of all time.</p>

      <label for="lmm0yod" class="commentText"><p>One of the most overlooked part of the story is his friendship with a white 13 year old boy when he was 22. The kid got traumatized after accidentally killing his best friend and Rodman helped him come out of his shell, even lived with his family in rural Oklahoma for some times.</p>

<p>The story ended on a poignant note as he stopped talking to the family, but Rodman has said he had fond memories of his time there and it helped him through college.</p>

<p>This is straight out of a Disney movie.</p>

<p>03-04 Detroit Pistons are a Cinderella team, beating a star-studded Lakers dynasty without an all-star through strong team play and defense.</p>

<p>Jeremy Lin somebody mentioned, that&rsquo;s a good one. Honestly Giannis at his spot turning into what he is today is not a bad example, either.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also propose Isaiah Thomas being under 6 feet and averaging like 28 pts per game in the late 2010&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="lmlrt3y" class="commentText"><p>Rodman would have been a good one if his post-career issues and shenanigans weren&rsquo;t so&hellip;. Colorful.</p>

<p>Dude was a janitor after highschool, grew 8 inches in 6 months, then went to Cook County College, flunked out, then went to Southeastern Oklahoma State University, an NAIA school. He befriended the son of a rich white family (the kid had accidentally shot and killed his best friend, and was a pariah) and they basically Michael Oher&rsquo;d him. He stopped communicating with them in 2013 after the matriarch N-bombed him.</p>

<p>Combined with his depression and suicide attempt, followed by his reinvention after, and all the hilarious shit he did during his career, it would make a good limited series.</p>

<p>That, and best rebounder (and Top 10 defender) ever.</p>

<p>EDIT: No, I don&rsquo;t count the godawful TV movie &ldquo;Bad as I wanna be&rdquo; as a story being told.</p>

      <label for="lmlvp7x" class="commentText"><p>The craziest Cinderella story is Jonathon Simmons IMO. He started off playing 2 years of JUCO, then played one season at University of Houston before declaring for the draft. He had some pre-draft workouts but went undrafted and played in the ABL, which had to pause mid-season due to lack of funds. Simmons then paid <span class="math inline">\(150 to attend the open try out for the Austin Spurs GLeague team. He was selected among the 60 who tried out to participate in their summer training camp. He then made the roster and played in the GLeague for 2 years before getting called up to play for San Antonio. He spent his age 26 rookie season as the 15th man on the roster, bouncing back and forth between San Antonio and Austin. His 2nd season, he broke out into a core rotation player, even starting 4 games in the Spurs WCF playoff run and being tasked with guarding the other team's best player when Kawhi wasn't on the court. He'd finally get his payday from Orlando that summer \)</span>20M/3 years. Unfortunately, he struggled on a bad Orlando team after developing a wrist injury that lasted for 2 years, was traded to Philly middle of the following season and was out of the league by age 30.</p>

      <label for="lmllltc" class="commentText"><p>Well Stephs carrier sort of became questionable due to injuries and the Warriors dynasty as a whole probably wouldnt have even become a thing if it wasnt for his injuries being bad enough for him not to get traded and then him later overcoming said injury issues to become a 4 time champion and 2 time MVP (including the only ever unanimous MVP).</p>

<p>Lebron coming back to the Cavs to win a chamoionship with them and finally doing so by beating the greatest regular season team in the leagues history while coming back down 3-1.</p>

<p>Dirks legendary redemption run where him and the Mavs destroyed the 2 time champion Lakers to go on to face the Heat, the same team (well franchise) that beat them half a decade ago in the finals and was now armed with even more stars alongside DWade (who back in 2006 was the leader of the Heat that beat them).</p>

<p>Then you also have the one last final run for a dynasty with the Spurs winning it in Tim Duncans twilight years.</p>

<p>Kobe managing to once more dominate the elague after Shaqs departure to prove that he can do it without Shaq.</p>

<p>Westbrooks 2017 MVP season where he brought the Thunder that lost their number 1 option to the playoffs, while averaging a triple double.</p>

<p>The Pistons amazing run in 2004, where they beat the Kobe and Shaq Lakers.</p>

<p>And i guess you could also throw on Jokic being the 41st pick to become a 3 time MVP and champion.</p>

<p>Maybe Giannises growth from an athletic, raw prospect into a 2 time MVP champion and dpoy.</p>

Wallace played JUCO for 2 years before getting an offer to play at a division 2 HBCU for his final 2 years, went undrafted, very briefly went to Italy to play then struggled to find a home in the NBA for 4 seasons before taking off like a rocket with Detroit and becoming the greatest undrafted player of all time with a HoF career, DPOYs and championships.</p>

      <label for="lmmcumj" class="commentText"><p>Nobody has mentioned it so I will nominate Joel Embiid. He was discovered at a basketball camp when he was 16, he had only been playing basketball for about a year at that point. He left his home country to attend high school without even knowing much English. He went viral for almost scoring on the wrong basket.</p>

<p>Flash forward to Kansas he plays great but gets hurt. He gets drafted to the worst team in NBA history and has to ride the bench and watch it happen. No vets. No mentorship. But he works hard to get back into shape and be healthy. Then he breaks his foot again. Then his brother tragically dies in an accident in Cameroon. He debates retirement before ever actually playing an NBA game.</p>

<p>Decides to still pursue basketball. But gets hurt his rookie year and narrowly misses out on ROTY. His own GM the got discovered for having burner twitter accounts where he openly trash talked him in favor of his teammate.</p>

<p>Goes on the win the MVP award in spite of all this. Only thing that could make the movie better would be a championship.</p>

<p>Swen was born in the Netherlands in 1950. His parents divorced when he was young and his mom remarried. Then to take a job overseas, Swen&rsquo;s mom and her new husband moved to the US <em>but left Swen and his sister behind at an orphanage.</em></p>

<p>Swen and his sister stayed at the orphanage for years and only got out and were reunited with their mom thanks to a television show, <em>It Could Be You</em>. The show flew the two kids to the US to have them reunited with their mom on TV.</p>

<p>Swen faced a lot of challenges in the US. He came to the country at age nine, not speaking a lick of English. He and his stepfather had a very contentious relationship. And the family was dirt poor. He was, however, tall and athletically gifted. When he was a junior he tried out for his HS&rsquo;s basketball team but showed up barefoot, as his parent&rsquo;s couldn&rsquo;t afford tennis shoes. The coach told him to come back when he had shoes, so he went and got them the only way he could - he stole a pair from another kid trying out for the team. When the coaches found out, they sent him home. He obviously did not make the team, and didn&rsquo;t try out his senior year.</p>

<p>After HS, Swen went to Cypress Community College. By pure happenstance, Tom Lubin (the JuCo&rsquo;s assistant coach / chemistry teacher) noticed this 6&rsquo;11&rdquo; behemoth roaming the halls and persuaded him to join the school&rsquo;s basketball team. Lubin and Nater formed a close relationship, and the Lubin&rsquo;s &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; Swen into their family.</p>

<p>On the court, Swen dominated and after his sophomore year he transferred to UCLA to backup Bill Walton for two years. After graduating from UCLA, Swen was courted by both the ABA and NBA, and chose to go into the ABA. He was named ABA Rookie of the Year and was a 2x ABA All Star a 1x ABA Rebounding champ before the ABA was merged into the NBA after 1976. He played in the NBA for another eight years and was a 2x NBA All Star, as well as the 1980 rebounding champ.</p>

<p><em>Fun fact 1: Nater was the first NBA first-round pick to have played in the NCAA without ever starting a college game.</em></p>

<p><em>Fun fact 2: Nater played just one season with the Bucks, but still holds their team record for most rebounds in a single game - 33.</em></p>

<p>He has to be the lowest drafted MVP in the last 40+yrs. It fits so well</p>

<p>I also read a crazy article about Michael Beasley one time, about how he bounced around in high school and at one point was at some school he didn&rsquo;t even know where it was on a map and he had to sleep on a cot that was only 6ft long with a tiny ass blanket.  He said he was ready to run away but didn&rsquo;t know how to get home.</p>

<p>Tracy McGrady was literally an unknown player until Sony Vacarro got him and invite and he walked on the court at the ABCD camp and proceeded to destroy everyone.</p>
