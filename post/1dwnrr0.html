      <p>Hey guys. I am a European that doesnt know much about how things work behind the scenes in the NBA. So I need a little bit of help to understand</p>

<p>From what I have understood until now is that Raptors at the moment have a <span class="math inline">\(161.8m salary. The 1st Apron is at \)</span>178.1m so they have a <span class="math inline">\(17m &quot;pillow&quot;
With the new restrictions the CBA has put they can use him as a trading asset \)</span>6.7m at the moment. And push him that are in between the 1st and 2nd Apron or above the 2nd Apron</p>

<p>The option to waive him now is illogical because that would be $6.7m dead cap</p>

<p>So the most logical option is to send him to a team that need him to fix their salaries and get below the 1st Apron.And then waive him</p>

<p>Do I have things straight? Too much info and they got me confused.Help me out here pleaseðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥²</p>

      <label for="lbvw6w2" class="commentText"><p>The Raptors likely aren&rsquo;t going to be a playoff team this year so the number they&rsquo;re probably looking at is the tax line at 170.8m. If they stay under that they don&rsquo;t pay any tax, have a bigger exception to use to sign a player, and get paid out from the tax-paying teams. Veznekov&rsquo;s salary is guaranteed so they won&rsquo;t be waiving him. I think if he wants to go back to Europe they will need his contact bought out. Not 100% on how that works.</p>

      <label for="lbw1y19" class="commentText"><p>Basically the two sides negotiate how much Vezenkov gives back. Let&rsquo;s say he&rsquo;s set to get 3M in Europe. Well the team could agree to a buyout of 3.7M which reduces his cap hit by 3M.</p>

      <label for="lbwbff5" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t believe buyout affects cap hit at all. It only affects how much the team has to actually pay him. His contract is still on the hook for it&rsquo;s entirety on salary cap.</p>

<p>Our coach is European and big Sasha fan, he could absolutely start for us but if he doesnâ€™t wanna be in nba anymore</p>

<p>He needs to agree give back money in buyout</p>

<p>He can negotiate a buyout where he gives up $6,658,536 in guaranteed money to be free from his contract, but Toronto has no incentive to do that. What he should do is ask for a trade to  a contender instead of running away to Greece.</p>

      <label for="lbwzf0p" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s slightly more complex than that. When a player is waived, unless they are a non-guaranteed contract, the salary still counts against the cap. The exception is a buy-out, which is a scenario where the player is not taking their full guaranteed amount. So if you&rsquo;re the Lakers and you&rsquo;re looking to dump a <span class="math inline">\(11m contract, the other team, unless they have cap space, needs to send out at least \)</span>5.5m to create a large enough exception to absorb that contract. And maybe your two choices are Vezenkov at <span class="math inline">\(6.7m, and another player who will actually play for you at \)</span>6m. That other player is going to be a much better deal&hellip; unless Vezenkov is giving up much more of his contract, say <span class="math inline">\(3m+, in a buyout. The thing is, it has to be good enough of a savings that the other team will want to give up additional assets in addition to the rostered player, because in most cases a \)</span>11m salary-dump player is going to be a negative for the Raptors, who would prefer prospects and draft picks right now.</p>

<p>As well, for the Raptors, it&rsquo;s not just about avoiding the 1st apron, but avoiding the luxury tax completely (around <span class="math inline">\(171m), because there's a significant financial benefit (as much as \)</span>10m) in being <span class="math inline">\(1 under the tax threshold vs. \)</span>1 over; Raptors have rarely been willing to go into the tax, and certainly wouldn&rsquo;t for the current team. Right now, they have the <span class="math inline">\(13m mid-level exception available to sign free agents, but they cannot spend all of this without going into the tax... they can only spend about \)</span>10m. In a buyout scenario for the Raptors, they would likely want to make sure that Vezenkov gives up at least enough money that they can spend their whole MLE, which means the Raptors paying around $3m.</p>

<p>If the Raptors played hardball with Vezenkov and forced him to accept, say, a <span class="math inline">\(1m buyout to clear his contract and return to Europe, then that means the Raptors would be able to spend all \)</span>13m of their MLE, plus still have enough left over to take on an additional <span class="math inline">\(2.5m in a trade where they send out Brown or Boucher, two players who the Raptors have been rumoured to try to trade. Or more likely, use something like \)</span>8m of their MLE, and then be able to take back as much as $7.5m more in a trade, which then can become a really valuable salary-dump for the other team and is much more likely to cause another team to give up the picks/prospects that the Raptors would like.</p>

<p>So there isn&rsquo;t really any incentive for the Raptors to just settle here and waive him, and unless he&rsquo;s willing to accept a significant buyout he doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of trade value either. In a buyout scenario it&rsquo;s questionable whether he has more value as a buyout by the Raptors, or a trade-and-buyout; it would depend on specific trade targets.</p>
