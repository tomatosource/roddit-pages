      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1d4qo46/ysk_that_alcohol_is_a_known_human_carcinogen/"><p>YSK that Alcohol is a known human carcinogen according to every reputable health organization known to man</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Why YSK: drinking alcohol is such a normalized part of our culture, and it is our duty to educate one another that it is in fact a known human carcinogen (Cancer causing agent)</p>

<p>1- Alcohol is not merely &ldquo;linked to cancer&rdquo; or &ldquo;may cause it to re-occur&rdquo;. That is a half-truth. It&rsquo;s metabolized form, the form that gets you drunk (acetaldehyde), DIRECTLY causes cancer by itself.</p>

<p>2- Both the WHO (world health organization) and the IARC (International Agency For Research on Cancer), the world&rsquo;s foremost cancer research organization, classifies the alcohol that we so casually consume to be a GROUP 1 CARCINOGEN. this is on the same level as Tobacco, Asbestos.</p>

<p>3- This truth is extraordinarily well hidden by the alcohol industry. chronic alcohol consumption is commonly presented as a &ldquo;risk factor&rdquo; for cancer rather than a direct cause in itself (which it is)</p>

<p>I hope this post blows up, so this finally becomes common knowledge. Peace‚úåüèº</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not fucking easy :/</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been largely depressed for the better part of my entire young adult life. The amount of social, financial, adventure, and romantic opportunities I have missed out on because of my anxiety is actually unholy. But I believe within myself I have the power to change, regardless of how much I have lost already.</p>

      <label for="l6gs656" class="commentText"><p>Lexapro helped me massively with my panic disorder, it tends to be a sedating SSRI.  These drugs aren&rsquo;t very precise though and everyone&rsquo;s mental health problems are different.  The only real solution is to find a good doctor and start trying stuff until one works.  I went through four or five different SSRIs before I tried lexapro.  It&rsquo;s a painful and long process.</p>

<p>edit: also research your drugs.  a lot of psychologists prescribe some absolutely whacky shit.  A big one in my area is prescribing seroquel (a very potent anti psychotic) as a way to treat insomnia in people with anxiety.  Shit put me in the hospital when I first took it.  Insomnia is an off-label use for it, no idea what that asshole was thinking, but several people I know around here have also been prescribed it for insomnia.</p>

IMO support is probably the most important factor, probably why folks end up in rehab where support is on tap&hellip; But those 12 step rehabs have got an unavoidable issue of substituting alcohol addiction with religious fervor, and I honestly don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s better. Anyways, if you&rsquo;re looking for a secular support group I found one in the Satanic Temple&rsquo;s Sober Faction: <a href="https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/sober-faction" target="_blank">https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/sober-faction</a></p>

It&rsquo;s like telling a smoker that they&rsquo;re gonna get cancer from smoking.  Bitch, we know.  That&rsquo;s not how addiction works.  Addicts are, for the most part, infinitely more educated than those trying to give facts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stop?&rdquo;  Because my brain doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>

<p>It really is an impossible thing to explain to a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; person.  And I get it, for most of my life I thought &ldquo;well why don&rsquo;t alcoholics get some self control and stop drinking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle and it snowballs fast.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve graduated with high honors in high school and college, got a full ride to a school for my academics.  I have a great job.  You probably work with more alcoholics than you think, its possible to be functional.  But that little alcoholic demon is always on your shoulder.</p>

<p>classifies the alcohol that we so casually consume to be a GROUP 1 CARCINOGEN. this is on the same level as Tobacco, Asbestos.</p>

<p>While true this statement is quite misleading.</p>

<p>The IARC carcinogen classification goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Group 1: carcinogenic</li>
<li>Group 2A: probably carcinogenic</li>
<li>Group 2B: possibly carcinogenic</li>
<li>Group 3: not classifiable</li>
<li>Group 4: probably not carcinogenic</li>
</ul>

<p>It does not classify carcinogens by their potency. Every single known carcinogen goes to group 1.</p>

      <label for="l6gq4ls" class="commentText"><p>The real problems with this &ldquo;charred meat bacon and sunlight&rdquo; argument are as follows:</p>

<p>1- Firstly, alcohol is one of the more dangerous of the group one carcinogens, and certainly more dangerous than all of those three things, easily. The cancer caused by sunlight is much less severe than the 7 cancer caused by alcohol.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no safe amount of alcohol, but there is a safe amount of sunlight.</p>

<p>2- Secondly, I&rsquo;m simply spreading awareness about the fact that alcohol is a carcinogen with no known safe threshold of consumption. Every drink that you consume increases your chances of developing cancer, even if minuscule.</p>

<p>Acknowledge that fact, and then make an informed decision from there</p>

<p>3- Thirdly, it misses the point of my post completely. I&rsquo;m not saying you can&rsquo;t enjoy life- just be aware of the risks and act accordingly, according to your own conscience. Alcohol directly causes seven types of cancer with direct correlation. It&rsquo;s not very enjoyable</p>

<p>I was attempting to draw the similarity between alcohol and tobacco/asbestos as known human carcinogens, NOT by their potency. My apologies.</p>

<p>The reason I chose tobacco and asbestos was because they are instantly recognizable and well-known confirmed carcinogens, which makes the read more easily digestible.</p>

<p>I hope alcohol will carry a similar stigma that tobacco does someday, with people understanding that although one is more potent than the other, thry are both known human carcinogens that are quite dangerous.</p>

      <label for="l6gpewt" class="commentText"><p>While I agree about these risks of alcohol, I doubt it will ever have the same stigma as tobacco. The potency isn‚Äôt even close unless you‚Äôre a very very heavy alcoholic.</p>

<p>Somebody who drinks a 6 pack a night (which is a heavy alcoholic) would have carcinogenic effects equivalent to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> a pack of cigarettes. Heavy smokers are typically a pack/day or more. So drinkers would need to consume at least a 12 pack per night or 5-6 shots/night to come close to their smoker counterparts.</p>

<p>Again I appreciate you bringing this to attention. As one of the norms I keep seeing is the drinking a glass of wine every night people. If you‚Äôre doing this, 1 out of 100 of people with this same habit will get cancer because of it.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t know the details underpinning how much of a risk it is but have worked in a field involving patients with alcohol related liver disease, and seen what it has done to their personal lives. Knowing the risks helps keep you in check of when enough is enough.</p>

      <label for="l6gsxex" class="commentText"><p>Addiction can make you make excuses for anything. A lot of people don&rsquo;t want to quit what makes them feel better, and many of them won&rsquo;t understand the consequences until the end. Smokers don&rsquo;t get it until they&rsquo;re in hospice with black lungs (even some still smoke while on oxygen, there&rsquo;s nonzero stories of people blowing their faces up for smoking while on oxygen), alcoholics don&rsquo;t get it until they end up in a coma. Harder drug users will literally OD and still come back from Narcan and do it the next day.</p>

<p>I had issues with alcohol in my 20s, I was able to step away from that, now I smoke weed, and even studies are coming around that it also can cause lung cancer- its not just about the nicotine from cigarettes, but any smoke inhalation. You inhale burning paper and it&rsquo;s gonna hurt you. My doctor has been trying to convince me to use edibles, but there&rsquo;s a soothing part about prepping/smoking from a pipe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m all for letting people make whatever decisions they want to make which poison them, make them less healthy and reduce their lifespan. But everyone should at least be <em>aware</em> of what alcohol actually is. It&rsquo;s literally poison.</p>

<p>I like running because for those 30+ minutes, my mind is almost entirely focused on my body and my surroundings. Does that mean I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;living life&rdquo; and am trying to escape it? I enjoy hiking in the mountains and traveling because it lets me get lost in a new world and forget my daily life for a bit. Is that bad then, since it&rsquo;s a type of escapism? I like watching a good movie or TV or reading a good book because I can get lost in the story for a bit. Is that me not enjoying life and trying to escape it?</p>

<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s bad to be drunk as a skunk from dawn to dusk. Obviously you shouldn&rsquo;t be cleaning off a fifth every day. But is it really that bad to enjoy getting drunk with your friends or your partner so you can enjoy being silly together for a little while?</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t get these puritan comments like yours, and they show up in just about any conversation about any activity I can think of that isn&rsquo;t socially acceptable.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also the main driver of the hangover. Shit chemical to have in your system! If you‚Äôre having a drink in moderation, NAC + Vit C can help (via glutathione production) with its breakdown in the liver into acetic acid which is completely harmless.

So while acetaldehyde is the byproduct of ethanol and causes cancer, ethanol also inhibits formaldehyde production, which is even more damaging to the body than acetaldehyde. You know what breaks down into formaldehyde in the body? Fruit juice (the preserved kind, not fresh squeezed). So while there are very few studies on this, it&rsquo;s been theorized that processed fruit juice may be more likely to lead to cancer than alcohol.</p>

<p>They use ethanol to treat methanol poisoning for this very reason. They all the use the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, and ethanol is the most competitive of the -ols.</p>

<p>You‚Äôd have a hard time arguing to a layman why fruit juice is more carcinogenic that a pint of beer, but this literally <em>could</em> be the case haha.</p>

      <label for="l6gltzh" class="commentText"><p>Perhaps you could clarify whether you  mean taking NAC before drinking or after.</p>

<p>The study I looked up is in mice, I learned this 10 years ago and in my memory it was tested in humans. I dunno, I‚Äôm not going to keep looking for it unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretreatment with NAC significantly protected against acute ethanol-induced liver damage in a dose-independent manner. Correspondingly, pretreatment with NAC significantly attenuated acute ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion and inhibited hepatic TNF-alpha mRNA expression. By contrast, post-treatment with NAC aggravated ethanol-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation and worsened acute ethanol-induced liver damage in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, NAC has a dual effect on acute ethanol-induced liver damage. Pretreatment with NAC prevent from acute ethanol-induced liver damage via counteracting ethanol-induced oxidative stress. When administered after ethanol, NAC might behave as a pro-oxidant and aggravate acute ethanol-induced liver damage.</p>

After that your risk of developing at least 7 types of cancers, cardiovascular disease and liver disease increases moderately at between 3-6 drinks per week, and highly at 7 or more drinks per week. Risk increases severely for each drink after 7 per week.</p>

The fact is though, that alcohol still causes cancer, and there is no safe level, as is clearly and BLATANTLY stated by the article I linked above from the world health organizations website:</p>

<p>Ripped directly from the WHO article: ¬≠¬≠¬≠</p>

<p>‚Ä¢</p>

<p>&ldquo;Risks start from the first drop</p>

<p>To identify a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù level of alcohol consumption, valid scientific evidence would need to demonstrate that at and below a certain level, there is no risk of illness or injury associated with alcohol consumption. The new WHO statement clarifies: currently available evidence cannot indicate the existence of a threshold at which the carcinogenic effects of alcohol ‚Äúswitch on‚Äù and start to manifest in the human body.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are no studies that would demonstrate that the potential beneficial effects of light and moderate drinking on cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes outweigh the cancer risk associated with these same levels of alcohol consumption for individual consumers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The culture of drinking alcohol has a long history of destroying people and families, it‚Äôs at best a temporary relief yet toxic mechanism and at worst a triggering system for rage and violence in already psychologically unstable individuals.</p>

<p>And to have the knowledge it also promotes cancer is yet another reason to reevaluate our acceptability of its use. I‚Äôll take a group of weed heads everytime over a pile of unintelligent annoying sloshed drunks.</p>

<p>Then she got diagnosed with esophageal cancer about a year later, and found out just how fucking horrific it is. She kept asking why it happened to her and I wish I could&rsquo;ve reminded her what she said earlier, but she had borderline personality disorder and wouldn&rsquo;t have believed me.</p>

<p>Anyway, it fell on me to take care of her until she died. The whole thing fucking sucked and 5 years later I&rsquo;m still pissed that she basically chose to put me in that position. She was a shit mom who didn&rsquo;t deserve the care I gave her, but my dad needed me so I did it for him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going into detail about just how horrific throat cancer is, or dying from your throat literally rotting away while you&rsquo;re still alive, but neither my brother nor I drink now.</p>

<p>There are plenty of addicts too obviously, but this kind of criticism isn‚Äôt helping them either. If your goal is to help people drink less or not at all, research shows that compassionate care is the right move. Finger wagging and making people feel bad just further entrenches the addiction in most cases.</p>

Find any vice, and you&rsquo;ll get people coming out of the woodwork to shout ADDICT! at anyone who says, &ldquo;Addiction is bad, but you can still do it a little bit&rdquo; when talking about specifically alcohol, weed, porn, or video games.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so strange to me. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s that reddit has become more conservative over the years or if the influx of more international people just brings in people coming from much stricter cultures, but I remember years ago when reddit was much more open to people living their lives how they see fit.</p>

<p>This thread is a perfect example. Yeah, alcohol is bad for you. Yeah, people already know that. Yeah, it&rsquo;s bad to binge drink regularly and it&rsquo;s good to drink in moderation. Yes, it&rsquo;s possible to do so. But the thread is filled with people talking about how evil alcohol is, how it adds nothing to your life, and how anyone who defends drinking any kind of alcohol at all is a defensive addict.</p>

<p>No room for nuance apparenlty, you either never drink at all or you&rsquo;re an alcoholic.</p>

<p>Firstly, alcohol is one of the more dangerous of the group one carcinogens, and certainly more dangerous than all of those three things, easily.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;m simply spreading awareness about the fact that alcohol is a carcinogen with no known safe threshold of consumption. Every drink that you consume increases your chances of developing cancer, even if minuscule.</p>

<p>Acknowledge that fact, and then make an informed decision from there</p>

      <label for="l6gkg15" class="commentText"><p>YSK Alcoholism and excessive drinking is very very bad. However the the impacts of light-moderate drinking on health (less than one drink per day on average) is not well defined. Much of the guidance around zero alcohol from the WHO comes from a 2018 study published in the Lancet which concluded that any alcohol intake constituted an increased risk. In the time since that study has been published, the methodology the study authors used has been criticized and called into question. The biggest critique is how the authors ignore interactions of impact to health from about 1.5 drinks per day and less and use only data points above that range to extrapolate that any alcohol intake is dangerous. Also, there are some interesting connections between the¬†Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) and the Neo Temperance movement that gives me pause to think about potential bias (although I personally think their 2011 guidelines on alcohol intake were too high - above 1.5 drinks per day). That being said I have personally cut back on drinking a bit and I enjoy the less calories and the new things it has pushed me to try. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30146330/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30146330/</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/29/17790118/alcohol-lancet-health-study" target="_blank">https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/29/17790118/alcohol-lancet-health-study</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64311705" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64311705</a> TL;DR - Alcoholism and excessive drinking¬† (more than 1.5 drinks per day) is very likely quite bad for you, but there is no conclusive evidence that zero alcohol intake the only way to remain risk free.¬†</p>

<p>Edit - to clarify, what I&rsquo;m saying is that¬† the data right now (directly from the study that said NO alcohol) does not seem to indicate a correlation or causation between light drinking and increased cancer risk. (At least that is my interpretation of the sources I cited. I invite everyone to read them and make their own determination instead of listening to some rando on Reddit, I am not an expert)</p>

      <label for="l6goozu" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôm in recovery from alcohol. It destroyed my life. For many years I was fine, until I wasn‚Äôt. I now work as a nurse at a hospital and the common denominator I see in my patients are that they have a history of chronic alcohol abuse. Even after I got sober myself from it, I didn‚Äôt realize just how bad alcohol was until I got into the medical field and I saw the patients for myself. I got sober while I was still young, these people drank for decades. Many of them who are long-term drinkers are in their 50s, but look like they are in their 70s. They are on more meds than I can count. Many of them don‚Äôt live past 70-80. They‚Äôre constantly in and out of the hospital. It will fuck your liver up by the time you‚Äôre 60. It can cause dementia. Higher risk for diabetes. I could go on.</p>

<p>If you drink moderately, that‚Äôs fine. But for those of you who need to drink more days than not or every day, just be careful. We never think it‚Äôll happen to us until it does. Not to mention, there‚Äôs tons of carbs and empty calories. The organs having to constantly work to break down a toxin, and that can be exhausting after years and years.</p>

<p>The people getting bent out of shape simply because OP shared facts about alcohol are being super insecure for some reason. You can absolutely drink if you want to, but these facts can be an eye opener for some people. Whether you like it or not, alcohol is a major risk factor for many health conditions. Just because your uncle has been drinking daily for 30 yrs and is currently fine doesn‚Äôt mean that alcohol is okay. There are people who smoke a pack a day for 30 years and don‚Äôt have lung cancer or emphysema. Does that mean smoking is okay? Drinking in moderation is fine, like most vices, but pretending like drinking every day is normal or okay is pure denial.</p>

      <label for="l6gn77e" class="commentText"><p>Tl:dr: there are so many things wrong with the who article.</p>

<p>Long answer. Before getting out the pitch forks, read the whole reply.</p>

<ol>
<li>they mention asbestos, smoking, radiation as members of group 1,but they ignore processed meat (whatever that is to be defined as), sun, sawdust, welding (again, that is not specific, as there are so many welding processes), etc. Furthermore, there are compounds on that list that, given one large exposure, are virtually guaranteed to result in cancer(like ionizing radiation).</li>
</ol>

<p>Being in group one means that, according to who, there is a statistically significant link between ingestion of the compound and risk increase of development of cancer. However, the magnitude of these risks vary wildly. Standing inside a reactor of a nuclear power plant has a much greater risk than drinking a pint of beer or eating two slices of bacon in the morning.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the who ommits the numbers on their page, which makes this classification very dangerous and misleading. There should be numbers and confidence intervals so that people can understand what this means. Furthermore, it should show the baseline risk versus the elevated risk. For example, assume that the risk of colon cancer is 20% of the population. When you have a 10% increase of risk, that means that there now is a 22% risk, not 30%. If you then look at the confidence intervals, it all of the sudden is not so dramatic anymore.</p></li>

<li><p>ethanol is a very prevalent compound. It is almost everywhere: the yeast when baking bread, the yeast in kombucha, hell, even in sauerkraut there is ethanol. So by the who logic, eating sauerkraut on your hotdog is similar to being present at a nuclear explosion. (ok, I know this skirts with reductio at absurdum).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, Op, I applaud you for wanting to raise awareness, but there are significant flaws in the reasoning of Who, and very often in the underlying scientific papers, especially in their use of gaussian statistics in non gaussian processes.</p>

<p>For clarity: I don&rsquo;t drink myself, and I am not trying to soothe myself or make excuses. I just want to give a thoughtful response and counter voice to the WHO article.</p>

<p>David spiegelhalter has an excellent book and talk about this subject.</p>

      <label for="l6gb6m7" class="commentText"><p>Great question.</p>

<p>The world health organization article I linked above directly addresses this. It says: ¬≠¬≠¬≠<br>
¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠<br>
‚Ä¢</p>

<p>[[[&ldquo;Risks start from the first drop</p>

<p>To identify a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù level of alcohol consumption, valid scientific evidence would need to demonstrate that at and below a certain level, there is no risk of illness or injury associated with alcohol consumption. The new WHO statement clarifies: currently available evidence cannot indicate the existence of a threshold at which the carcinogenic effects of alcohol ‚Äúswitch on‚Äù and start to manifest in the human body.&rdquo;]]]</p>

<p>‚Ä¢</p>

<p>Now, of course, your odds are quite slim of contracting cancer from alcohol consumption if you have light consumption.</p>

<p>The point being- is that even a single glass of alcohol can increase your chances of getting cancer, even if it is a minuscule amount. Now- compound those glasses overtime, and it becomes a lot larger. Combine that with more consistent drinking, and giving your immune system less time to recover, and your cancer chance becomes even larger.</p>

<p>Obviously, it is also also dependent on many individual biological factors, but that is the basic rundown of it. No safe level.</p>

      <label for="l6gq5dt" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely true, although that‚Äôs arguably not a primary reason why excessive alcohol consumption is so toxic for people.
¬†
The best reason to only use it occasionally in moderation (if possible for you) isn&rsquo;t¬†due to it being a known carcinogen, but rather its liver toxicity. Especially if it is mixed with other medications (such as Tylenol), or taken frequently in excess. (Cirrhosis of the liver due to alcoholism is far more common than cancer caused by alcohol).¬†</p>

<p>Secondly, is the detrimental psychological aspects. Not only is it psychologically addictive, but excessive use has been shown to lead to antisocial behavior, (as well as irritability, mood swings, basically being more of a dick etc.).¬†</p>

<p>Side note: it‚Äôs also worth mentioning that a class 1 carcinogen doesn‚Äôt describe how likely it is to give you cancer, but rather how strong we know the link between the substance and cancer is.¬†
Essentially it means we know for a fact that alcohol increases risk of cancer, but doesn‚Äôt indicate whether it increases the risk by 5% or 0.05%.</p>

<p>I got good friends that claim to be ‚Äúsober‚Äù and get judgmental‚Ä¶ but they wake and bake most days and are on antidepressants. Lol.</p>

<p>I mean. As long as you‚Äôre not hurting anyone‚Ä¶ I say do whatever helps you get through the day.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm an alcoholic. I make no excuses. That shit got me. I‚Äôm high functioning. Generally pretty nice. I work hard. pay my bills. Show up for family and friends. Volunteer. Mentor folks. I do my shit.</p>

<p>But wow. Weed and alcohol ‚Äúculture‚Äù is cheesy as hell. Making your personality ‚Äúsubstance abuse‚Äù is cringe as fuck.</p>

<p>What can you create? What do you do? What do you like? Where have you been? Who do you love? That‚Äôs the cool stuff.</p>

<p>Your addiction isn‚Äôt interesting.</p>

      <label for="l6gkvyk" class="commentText"><p>Humans evolved alongside alcohol and some even believe it was critical to our long-term success. Also, acetaldehyde is definitely not good for you but it&rsquo;s only present in the liver briefly before being further broken down. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re inhaling toxic VOCs of acetaldehyde, which is far more toxic for the body. My point is, alcohol isn&rsquo;t going anywhere and that&rsquo;s probably OK.¬†</p>

      <label for="l6gn2bj" class="commentText"><p>1- That&rsquo;s interesting, do you have any sources that discuss its importance to the long-term success of society? I highly doubt it was &ldquo;critical&rdquo; but at that point I&rsquo;m just splitting hairs.</p>

<p>2- alcohol consumption directly leads to least 8 major cancers</p>

<p>3- Much of the rest you&rsquo;ve said is dependent on how responsibly people choose to use it. You can use it to get blackout drunk with your car keys in your pocket and run the risk of inadvertantly bowling over a family, or you can have a glass or two just to get rid of your anxiety and break yourself into a social scene more easily.</p>

<p>I would argue that alcohol has a far more negative impact than any positives it may have, buy and large. At that point, we&rsquo;re not even having a biological argument, just a sociological one.</p>

      <label for="l6gsiuq" class="commentText"><p>There is so much literature on the topic of human evolution and alcohol consumption. Here is one link: <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/evolutionary-psychiatry/social-function-of-alcohol-from-an-evolutionary-perspective/99C4A1CDBE2182568CD961E71B19E006" target="_blank">https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/evolutionary-psychiatry/social-function-of-alcohol-from-an-evolutionary-perspective/99C4A1CDBE2182568CD961E71B19E006</a></p>

<p>Also, I never said alcohol was good for your body. Just that making and drinking alcohol is intrinsically tied to human evolution and helped shaped our modern civilization. I mean, you just got to look back 200+ years and everyone is drinking low strength alcohol all the time. It was¬†a clean source of hydration in times when we didn&rsquo;t have filtered water on tap. It helped fuel long distance travel and voyages. It helped to clean and disinfectant (Romans famously used wine to clean wounds). Then there is the whole sociological component to alcohol consumption in groups of humans. There are many many books about this aspect but long story short, it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that the first human tribes to reach out peacefully to one another did it while getting hammered drunk on neolithic IPAs. We were crushing brews in 20,000BCE and I fully expect we will be crushing brews¬†in 20,000CE</p>
