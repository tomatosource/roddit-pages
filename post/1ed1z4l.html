      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ed1z4l/demar_derozan_deserves_his_respect/"><p>Demar derozan deserves his respect</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Most points scored out of all nba players in the last 3 years</p>

<ol>
<li>Luka Doncic - 6355</li>
<li>Jayson Tatum - 6258</li>
<li>Giannis Antetokounmpo - 6183</li>
<li>Demar Derozan - 5831</li>
<li>Nikola Jokic - 5778</li>
</ol>

<p>Demar derozan has been a bucket his whole career, climbing all the way to 32nd on the all time nba scoring list already. I envision him getting into to the top 20 when it’s all said and done.
Demar is still playing at a high level with great durability.</p>

<p>Just wish more of the everyday fans realized that he’s one of the greats.</p>

<p>Kings going to be nice this year</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s been an awful playoff performer</p>

<p>22 ppg on 42% eFG in toronto</p>

<p>a negative every playoffs with him</p>

<p>he was good in the series he played in san antonio, which i guess could make you think what if he had just a Pop or Spo level coach the whole time</p>

<p>but for what it was, just terrible yearly</p>

<p>20 playoff games in 2016 and he had a 46% TS that&rsquo;s insane</p>

      <label for="lf4hlqs" class="commentText"><p>There were a lot of reasons actually. The main reason was LeBron, of course. Another reason is that DeMar isn&rsquo;t a playoff performer at all. Then you have KLove outscoring all Raptors players, J.R Smith and Kyle Korver shooting like .65 from three combined. LeBron carried a much worse team to a finals against the Pistons in 2007, which was a better playoff team than those Raptors. I would say those Raptors had no reason to be sweept by the Cavs though.</p>

Of their starting lineup 4 had at least 3 all-star appearances (Chris Webber was mostly washed, but still), the other (Tayshaun Prince) had 4 all-defensive selections, and the most important: they delivered in the playoffs.</p>

No doubt he is a good player. and def the teams hes had over the last few years hasnt been good. But hes just never been very efficient as a scorer, regardless. What makes derozan great - his midrange game - is also his flaw. the midrange game is just inherently inefficient. And at this point, hes old. What can you expect from him so late into his career? Im not trying to be a hater, but its just what the situation is</p>

      <label for="lf55wzz" class="commentText"><p>The midrange game can be inefficient, but Derozan is a high-level foul baiter. All his free throw stats are very high and much higher than league average. As a result, if you look at his efficiency compared to the league, then he actually is just about average even though the game has moved on to 3-point chucking.</p>

<p>In some of his recent seasons, he was definitely very efficient, but I agree that he&rsquo;s nowhere near as efficient as the other guys that OP mentioned.</p>

      <label for="lf4dizq" class="commentText"><p>I agree, midrange is tough as it ultimately doesn’t lead to as much points as 3s. But inefficient? You should go check demars numbers again cause he’s been super efficient as he’s aged. And I’m expecting him to have a couple more good years on the kings and make people realize the caliber of player he really is when he’s actually on a good team. Don’t blame you for thinking this on derozan though everyone likes to discredit him.</p>

He drops pretty hard in the playoffs, despite his skillset (Tough shotmaking and midrange scoring) being built for the postseason, he&rsquo;s never been a good defender (maybe plus/positive at best), and has never been a good playmaker either, which limits his offensive game.</p>

<p>Add that swapping him and Kawhi led to a championship for the raptors sealed his fate.</p>

<p>Also the last 5 seasons he’s done nothing in San Antonio and Chicago. He’s like a 9-5 worker cashing those checks and leaving for home at the end of the regular season</p>

The team that won the championship vs the team demar had was also significantly different with Marc gasol, danny green and the emergence of pascal siakam/ fvv.</p>

<p>And this post clearly shows you demars done something in the last 5 years, team success is different due to personnel. Nikola vucevic is the devil I promise</p>
