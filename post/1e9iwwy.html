<li><p>Moody&rsquo;s lack of pt is a little overstated. He played 17.5 mpg in 66 games (&amp; he did have a couple minor injuries that caused him to miss ~ 10 games).</p></li>

<li><p>When the warriors were healthy, they had a lot of wings. Klay and Wiggins struggled early in the season but Kerr was never going to completely bench them and both eventually settled into effective roles 6th man and 3&amp;D wing roles, respectively. Kuminga had a great second half. GP2 knows how to play off of Steph and is a top 5 guard defensively. Podz has a much better handle and passing than Moody and the other guys I&rsquo;ve mentioned are not amazing in those areas so Podz&rsquo;s fit was nice.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There were definitely times when I was annoyed with Kerr not going to Moody more but its not like Moody never played and its not like the lineup had a huge need for another wing.</p>

<p>Kuminga had a good stretch of games last year and Iâ€™m hoping Kerr trusts him more next year. If Wiggins gets traded then Kuminga will definitely start so maybe he just needs to start and gain experience with the starters and heâ€™ll be better off</p>

<p>Kuminga will get paid, but he doesn&rsquo;t have the resume to justify a 25% max.</p>

<p>Also, the reason the Jazz would turn down Kuminga would be because of his looming extension. You don&rsquo;t turn your nose at proven talent for a rookie and a sophomore on a rebuilding team.  Except, again, for money reasons.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s super fair to look at all of those guys from the 2021 draft and argue the <em>none</em> of them have clear #1 upside (Cade is probably the closest, but also the guy who&rsquo;s done the least and has struggled to stay healthy) compared to past years, but rookie extensions are rarely based on resume, they&rsquo;re based on early indicators and upside.</p>

      <label for="leenc1c" class="commentText"><p>I always find this hilarious when Franz, Mobley or even Scottie get mentioned like &ldquo;if they got the max, so and so also wanted it&rdquo; but nobody ever mentions Cade. Franz, Mobley, Suggs, and Scottie are the most accomplished from their class. Straight up one was an injury replacement All Star, another was a co-leader on a 5th seed squad, 2 were all nba defenders.</p>

<p>Nobody but these 5 have shown anything in the class. None of them have shown winning as the best player on the court like Franz has, none have shown defense like Suggs and Mobley, and none have shown league recognition like Scottie (though I feel many of that is manufactured for the Canada bucks).</p>

<p>If it was up to me as a reddit GM, im only giving the max to Franz and Scottie both of whom are massively respected in the league and have legit potential to be real all stars next season. They arent far off at all. Next up is Mobley, Suggs, Cade, and Sengun for max but would try to negotiate down. Then nobody else imo.</p>

      <label for="leeoywn" class="commentText"><p>I donâ€™t get the handwringing in Utah over the prospect of an extension. Cap space is not a valuable commodity for the Jazz because players donâ€™t want to sign there in FA, especially as they head into the nadir of their rebuild, which is likely to last 3-4 years. Iâ€™m not sure the talent gap between Podz and Kuminga is enough to justify this much vacillation over their respective deals, although the Jazz should extract more draft capital for taking Kuminga on ofc. By the time Utah needs to think about cap space again, a Kuminga extension will probably have run its course or nearly so and theyâ€™ll know whether heâ€™s worth keeping around or not. At this point, Kuminga is more of a sure thing than a draft pick at any rate, and they donâ€™t currently have the roster infrastructure to build a contender around Lauri during his prime.</p>

      <label for="leerrd7" class="commentText"><p>Fake news. The Lauri trade was dead last week with Lacobs comments on mastermind GMs trying to impress their owners. It is obvious he was talking about Ainge and bitter that Ainge wasted his time. At this point, Utah&rsquo;s owner needs to have Ainges back bc he got raw dogged by debatably the most successful NBA owner ever. So, no trade. Whatever scoop is coming out now is probably 1) speculation (&ldquo;I am getting the sense that&rdquo;), 2) misinformation for retribution purposes (I mean, all Ainge has to do is imply that the Ws said this and he has quality get-back for Lacob sonning him)</p>
