<p>his career ftr is only .389, right around Kobe and Bulls Jordan</p>

<p>his 4 miami years were only .426, rookie paolo had a higher ftr than any miami lebron season</p>

      <label for="ll38bzp" class="commentText"><p>He actually doesn’t get as many calls as he deserves especially for a star of his caliber. Not that I think stars deserve more simply for being stars, but considering stars do get favorable calls, I find myself baffled often how he <em>doesn’t</em> get the calls he’s earned with his aggressive play style.</p>

<p>So I think in response, he’s sort of “forced” to flop and exaggerate otherwise he won’t get calls.</p>

<p>And of course this all circles back to a big problem with the league as a whole, flopping is rewarded and provides too big of an advantage.</p>

      <label for="ll3kt7h" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a Shaq problem. Shaq should have gotten more calls with how he was defended. He also should have gotten more calls with the way he played. Every spin move he did with his offhand was essentially a foul. For Lebron, he basically lowers his shoulder the entire time. I think it&rsquo;s a push. It&rsquo;s incredible his body held up and the strength and control he shows to finish is top notch; but the fouls, idk. I think it&rsquo;s the give and take of his play style.</p>

      <label for="ll3vb7k" class="commentText"><p>LeBron is certainly known for putting his shoulder down but many players do. Lowering the shoulder gives cover for the ball among driving with force. LeBron is just bigger and he isn&rsquo;t going to sandbag his strength. What officials will call is arm extensions - push offs etc.</p>

<p>Lowering the shoulder will get offensive foul calls, but far less frequently. Maybe as frequent as moving screens.</p>

      <label for="ll4656f" class="commentText"><p>I used to get pretty frustrated watching how Eddy Curry was officiated on the Knicks. He had a great scoring touch around the basket and could bulldoze his way around the paint, but he frequently got called for offensive fouls on stuff that wasn&rsquo;t half as violent as what Shaq would do on every post up. Shaq was pretty much impossible to officiate, both in terms of drawing and committing fouls.</p>

      <label for="ll38bux" class="commentText"><p>How often he flops is exaggerated. It’s really just more so that people tend to focus more on anything Bron does, and some of his flops are egregiously bad. But if he’s driving to the hoop or something, even if he flops or exaggerated contact, he’s clearly aiming to make the shot rather than just purely hoisting up a wild shot while trying to draw a foul</p>

And, not that I support histrionics, usually, when he gets super upset, it&rsquo;s because he genuinely was fouled.</p>

<p>Wilt was a pretty good midrange shooter, unlike the stereotypical center.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ironic for a good midrange shooter to be high in FTA and not in FTM, because the expected outcome for a good midrange shooter is him being a good FT shooter, since a FT is factually a midrange shot. Wilt was awful at FT when we could have reasonnably expected him to be at least average.</p>

<p>If I were to say, hypothetically, “It&rsquo;s ironic that Steph lost this 3-point contest” I wouldn&rsquo;t consider it necessary to specify “because he&rsquo;s a good 3-point shooter&rdquo; in my original point.</p>

<p>I felt obliged to explain since you keep arguing semantics, but my point is still exactly the same. I didn&rsquo;t suddenly invent the fact that Wilt is a good midrange shooter. It&rsquo;s a known and easily verifiable fact.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re the one using a stereotype about centers to try to prove your point when we&rsquo;re specifically talking about Wilt who is clearly not a stereotypical center. If anything you&rsquo;re the one moving goal posts to try and prove your point.</p>

      <label for="ll622t7" class="commentText"><p>That’s… not irony. Note how the definition states “intended”. Irony is when something is intended to happen but actually leads to the complete opposite happening. Not when you simply observe something that suggests the opposite of what you’d expect- that’s just unexpected or surprising, though I don’t even think that’s the case here since bigs often don’t shoot well from the line, and get fouled even more as a result.</p>

<p>An example of irony would be intentionally hacking Wilt in a late game scenario, and then he steps up and hits 6 straight free throws to clutch the game. Even more ironic would be if the opposing big took a shot at Wilt before the game for being a bad free throw shooter, and then shoots abysmally himself.</p>

<p>To me, an excellent midrange shooter being unable to be, at least, average in FT% is ironic, like a police station being robbed is ironic or a pilot having a fear of flight is ironic.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about bigs, we&rsquo;re talking about Wilt. My point is specifically about Wilt, that&rsquo;s why I used quite subtly the word &ldquo;Wilt&rdquo; and not the word &ldquo;bigs&rdquo;. If I was talking about Curry I&rsquo;d assume you understand I&rsquo;m talking specifically about Steph and his skillset and not about combo-guards as a whole.</p>

<p>Nowhere here is the fact the opposing big should shoot well intended tho. How&rsquo;s that ironic ? Note that the definition states &ldquo;intended&rdquo; (:</p>

      <label for="ll478h3" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say there was anything either stretch or finesse about Kurt Thomas&rsquo;s game. He was tough as nails and loved to shoot the midrange J (a common profile for role player PFs back in the day) but didn&rsquo;t really do any driving or posting up. He was also never a 3 point shooter (only 32 attempts in 18 seasons).</p>

<p>I have some memories of his 3pt attempts. As a Knicks fan, I can say, every time he let one fly, I cringed&hellip; And then shouted at the TV.</p>

<p>Last season Steph Curry averaged more free throws than Lebron for most of the season and Steph shot 876 3 point attempts lmao it&rsquo;s not like he was playing around in the paint, the narrative Lebron is a flopper and lives at the free throw line is entirely made up, the guy gets you baskets, it&rsquo;s just that when he does cry for no calls he is very dramatic about it LMAO</p>

      <label for="ll477hl" class="commentText"><p>Lillard is only gets put next to dudes like Harden and Embiid on Reddit. His career FT rate is so much lower than theirs it&rsquo;s not even in the same sphere.</p>

<p>To put it into context, Harden has <strong>9 seasons</strong> with over 8 FTAs a game. Lillard has <strong>one</strong> single season that meets that criteria.</p>

<p>Harden&rsquo;s career high season is 11.8 compared to Lillard&rsquo;s 9.6 (22% higher) and Harden&rsquo;s second highest season is 11.0 compared to Lillard&rsquo;s 7.8 (41% higher.) Embiid&rsquo;s career high is also 11.8.</p>

<p>Lillard&rsquo;s FT attempts last year of 7.0 would only be Harden&rsquo;s 12th highest out of 15 seasons. It is also lower than every single one of Embiid&rsquo;s seasons.</p>
