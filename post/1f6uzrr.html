<p>his career ftr is only .389, right around Kobe and Bulls Jordan</p>

<p>his 4 miami years were only .426, rookie paolo had a higher ftr than any miami lebron season</p>

<p>his 4 cleveland return years were only at .370</p>

      <label for="ll38bzp" class="commentText"><p>He actually doesn’t get as many calls as he deserves especially for a star of his caliber. Not that I think stars deserve more simply for being stars, but considering stars do get favorable calls, I find myself baffled often how he <em>doesn’t</em> get the calls he’s earned with his aggressive play style.</p>

<p>So I think in response, he’s sort of “forced” to flop and exaggerate otherwise he won’t get calls.</p>

<p>And of course this all circles back to a big problem with the league as a whole, flopping is rewarded and provides too big of an advantage.</p>

      <label for="ll3kt7h" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a Shaq problem. Shaq should have gotten more calls with how he was defended. He also should have gotten more calls with the way he played. Every spin move he did with his offhand was essentially a foul. For Lebron, he basically lowers his shoulder the entire time. I think it&rsquo;s a push. It&rsquo;s incredible his body held up and the strength and control he shows to finish is top notch; but the fouls, idk. I think it&rsquo;s the give and take of his play style.</p>

      <label for="ll3vb7k" class="commentText"><p>LeBron is certainly known for putting his shoulder down but many players do. Lowering the shoulder gives cover for the ball among driving with force. LeBron is just bigger and he isn&rsquo;t going to sandbag his strength. What officials will call is arm extensions - push offs etc.</p>

<p>Lowering the shoulder will get offensive foul calls, but far less frequently. Maybe as frequent as moving screens.</p>

      <label for="ll38bux" class="commentText"><p>How often he flops is exaggerated. It’s really just more so that people tend to focus more on anything Bron does, and some of his flops are egregiously bad. But if he’s driving to the hoop or something, even if he flops or exaggerated contact, he’s clearly aiming to make the shot rather than just purely hoisting up a wild shot while trying to draw a foul</p>

<p>Was he a pretty pathetic flopper in some years? Did he not incorporate a post game regularly? Did he crab walk and travel often? Sure, but all of that has been fixed to a point where it’s no more of a problem than any other player.</p>

<p>Klay Thompson has played 286 games without getting a foul call.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of NBA players who <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nba-players-who-have-played-the-most-games-without-taking-a-free-throw" target="_blank">played the most games without making a FT attempt</a>:</p>

<pre><code>               Games without a FTA       FT%
Kyle Korver            639              87.7%
Tree Rollins           626              70.0%
Steve Blake            622              77.9%
Matt Bonner            604              78.0%
Jud Buechler           590              63.3%
Joe Kleine             572              79.3%
Danny Green            571              80.5%
Steve Kerr             571              86.4%
Patty Mills            570              85.6%
Kurt Thomas            568              76.0
</code></pre>

<p>They&rsquo;re mostly catch &amp; release shooters who fired with an open window. I can&rsquo;t explain Jud Buechler at all (maybe he was only allowed to shoot when he was wide open)</p>
