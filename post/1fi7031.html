      <label for="lng6ad2" class="commentText"><p>First and foremost I would not rate Heatles post 2012 as  a super team with how much Wade declined due to his knee injury.</p>

<p>Coming on to your Bosh point, Yes bosh did take the biggest reduction in offensive involvement as he became tertiary next to LeBron and Wade as love did next to LeBron &amp; Kyrie but unlike love, bosh consistently provided value as a decent defender and was a solid stretch 5 for that time. Love while  did provide  a great deal of  spacing and was a great connective passer in his relegated role as an tertiary, he bled a lot of it back with how bad he was defensively. Also remember due to him losing a lot of weight, even when he was asked to post up he just wasn&rsquo;t that good at capitalising those plays as he was in his Minnesota days</p>

Love was NOT capable of being the main guy or even the 2nd guy on winning team. He was a star in Minnesota, but that doesn’t mean he was that great on the cavs because he wasn’t. I would say he was still very good, but he wasn’t great or star player level which is what would’ve made them a super team, he was an elite role player and it wasn’t because that was what lebron wanted (incredibly stupid comment by the way lol) it was because that was what the team needed from him in order to win.</p>

<p>Dropping 34 in a quarter one time doesn’t mean he was a great, star player the entire season lol especially considering it was against the blazers. If thats the logic you want to use though im sure you think Tony delk was a great player because he had a game where he scored 53 yet averaged less than 10ppg for his career, but that doesn’t matter cause he scored 50 once.</p>

      <label for="lnfu2j1" class="commentText"><p>Love was always ass in the playoffs.  Couldn&rsquo;t defend anybody aside from steph on exactly one key possession.  Fg% was usually putrid too. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there were entire series where he shot like 16%.  He was so invisible sometimes nobody even bothered mentioning him as somebody that needed to step up in big games.  He was basically a floor spacing defensive rebounder role player.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that one big quarter was the only time he ever played well in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Like I&rsquo;m super happy about that defensive stop of his on curry in their championship year, but even in that series, the cavs blew out the warriors when love was injured.</p>

The steph stop, the one huge quarter in Toronto, and I remember he once had a really nice high effort block out of nowhere.  I think that&rsquo;s about it for his highlights.

And even then outside of Hawks none of the defenses in 16 &amp; 17  they faced were all that great and were average-above average and against the hawks, while he did shot well from 3 he was putrid from elsewhere, had an efficiency of 50% ts despite shooting 48% on 3s .</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re at three objective sources (box scores, all-star voting, ranking by the largest media entity in sports) saying Love was star-level at the time, and all you have is&hellip; your own subjective opinion.</p>

And I look at the other side &amp; he’s leaning very causally. He’s played every single minute up to that point, and he looked unfazed. To me that was disturbing.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lng7x9c" class="commentText"><p>Easily that 2018 entire playoff run was a different beast but his 2015 and 2017 finals performances are extremely underrated simply because he lost. Only player in history to average a triple double in the finals, was so good he was the first player since Jerry West to get FMVP votes on a losing team. We will very  likely never see something like that and most probably will never see something like his 4 finals run from 2015 to 2018.</p>

<p>I personally dislike that KD made that decision. But no organization is going to turn down a great player wanting to sign with them. I only was drawing a parallel.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we as fans need to accept that in this era with the power that superstars have, more and more players are going to join together to increase their win chances.</p>

<p>say whatever you want about KD, his legacy would probably be worse off if he had stuck around in OKC without winning one instead of going to GS and getting it done. look how consistently the lack of rings is brought up when discussing guys like Barkley, Ewing, Harden etc.</p>

      <label for="lng9bmz" class="commentText"><p>idk if they would have. tbh whether KD publicly admits it or not I feel like he had grown tired of playing for the Thunder. maybe it was bc WB had a tendency to play hero ball in clutch situations, or bc he was sick of playing in a system with loads of defensive attention on him every single play and absolutely awful spacing (which Presti never did much to address even during the PG years)</p>

<p>I feel like it’s probably the latter given that he did publicly admit that he wanted to play in a more free-flowing system where he could trust the other four guys on the floor more than he could in OKC</p>

<ol>
<li>how many votes does the 12th place guy get?</li>
<li>im just saying that using “top 12” is something i’ve never seen before lol</li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah I just checked. He was Tied 12th with 4 people… The max points You could receive was 1230. Lebron got 1205 in First place, KD got 609 in second. Tied for 12th place with a whopping 1 point, Chauncey Billups, Stephen Jackson, Joe Johnson, and Chris Bosh…</p>

<p>Being in a 4 way tie for 12 is irrelevant, that basically just means you were an all star tbh and probably just got a 3rd place vote from your local journalist with a vote like when Melo got that 1 vote from the guy in NY the year Lebron should’ve won MVP Unanimously</p>

At least curry won 2 other rings and led his team to a 3-1 comeback against KD’s team… KD’s the one who joined the 73-9 superteam that beat him and never won anything before or after. I will never consider the 2017 and 2018 legitimate for every player of that team but Curry’s much greater than KD.</p>

Every team has played &ldquo;close&rdquo; games against them and feels that it means something. It doesn&rsquo;t. Teams don&rsquo;t need to run up the score.

As a grown man, you can’t put your destiny in the hands of another man. However, he lost all of that for me when he played around in Boston. That team was already there, and he should’ve been the alpha to put them over the top. He really could have had an incredible legacy had he performed there. Then he tarnished his legacy, as well as KD and Harden in Brooklyn. All 3 of them would have top 35 arguments in an all time list had they won in Brooklyn.</p>

Basketball defense in general has become I don&rsquo;t want to say non existent that isn&rsquo;t true. But teams do not play the same type of defense like before or run schemes like before. The game is way too offensively driven and one on one at times. It&rsquo;s killing the actual enjoyment for the sport. Players have too much freedom offensively now and the refs give you everything since any touch is now considered a foul as well. It&rsquo;s a problem, and that&rsquo;s why those ranking don&rsquo;t mean anything to me.</p>

Because the only defense was actually played throughout that whole series is probably at the end of game 3. And even still it was open shots here and there. That series was too much talent on both sides and was who can score more faster. It was never about getting stops and slowing down the other team. It just never happened that series, they were all either 15-20 point leads constantly being cut back and forth till it ended in either  a blow out.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re forgetting a worse version of Spurs in 2017 with Kawhi and Alridge were up 20 + against 2017 warriors. And you don&rsquo;t think the likes of 2013 Heat or 2014 Spurs isn&rsquo;t competing lol</p>

<p>2014 mavs and the baby thunder don&rsquo;t move me at all, if anything the teams you are talking about pushing your supposed defensive super teams to 6 and 7 show me they would get smoked by either 2017 final team who both swept their conferences bar 1 game.
The 2014 spurs also didn&rsquo;t play against 2013 dwade they played against 2014 score 15 ppg in the finals on 44 percent shooting dwade, aka a ghost of his prime self</p>

<p>The 2017 spurs being up for one half against a team literally know for coming back and blowing teams out in the 3rd quarter has got to be the most overblown what if in nba history.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think either team is getting swept but neither has the star power to keep up with the 2017 teams considering great offense always beats great defense.</p>

Whereas no sleeves are no sleeves, so there is no variance. I&rsquo;ve never minded playing in sleeves, but when you&rsquo;re a pro you want as much variance removed as possible so that you can perform consistently.</p>

Kyrie changed teams 3 times in 7 years and was the 2nd (even 3rd) option the entire time including when he made the finals again.</p>

Kyrie went to Brooklyn, pressured them to trade all their young prospects away, and then forced his own way out. You could switch Kyrie and Lebrons names in your posts and it would be more true. I think Kyrie fits the “jumps from team to team” a bit better than Lebron.</p>

      <label for="lng2ufm" class="commentText"><p>He also simply never asked to be in Cleveland lol. Rookie contracts and its extension are not the will of the players. Fans must understand that. Its cool that Edwards is comfortable in Minneapolis, but he never asked to be there and if he had the choice back a few years ago, he would propably play in Atlanta instead. If he finds a better place for him in the near future and makes some moves, it should make sense to us.</p>

<p>Logic consequence of letting ping pong balls decide over half the careers of the most gifted athletes in the world.</p>

      <label for="lngfwp9" class="commentText"><p>The 5 year maximum extension that he signed to stay in Cleveland was his choice. I understand your point of the extension being the only way to make “max” money. But it is his choice.</p>

<p>Cleveland held up their end of the bargain. They took him to 3 straight finals and won a championship. Kyrie bailed anyway.</p>

<p>Kyrie was immature, winning wasn’t enough for him, he wanted to win HIS way. Hopefully he has matured enough and found a home in Dallas.</p>

      <label for="lng23vv" class="commentText"><p>Kyrie didn&rsquo;t forced himself out of Cleveland. He needed to get season ending surgery and was about to leave Cleveland after his contract anyways, so he told the Cavs and they traded him and he got the season endig surgery in Boston instead.</p>

<p>Talking with your franchise about your plans in free agency and let them do their thing is not a powerplay, its mature business.</p>

<p>You can not handle a departure cleaner and fairer than guys like Kyrie, AD or Melo did, yet people are still offended. Weird mentality, I always wonder how the people can endure other sports like soccer, where literally everyone is acting this way.</p>

      <label for="lngl3x7" class="commentText"><p>Kyrie had 3 years left on his contract when he requested a trade out of Cleveland.</p>

<p>If he was planning on leaving Cleveland in 2019-2020, then why did he request a trade in the summer of 2017? If he was planning on getting season ending surgery while he was with the Cavs, why did he wait to get season ending surgery nearly a year later after playing a whole season?</p>

<p>I think we should listen to Kyrie on why he requested a trade from Cleveland and not do these mental gymnastics. He wanted a fresh start as the number one option.</p>

      <label for="lnfm51h" class="commentText"><p>Joined a superteam in Miami and then left them high and dry when he got spanked by the Spurs in 2014.</p>

<p>Goes to a Cavs team that had many high drafted prospects. Kyrie was an All-Star level player. Tristan Thompson was a high pick that was a solid starting C. Wiggins and Bennett were 1st overall picks that were packaged to get Kevin Love. Waiters was another high pick packaged to get JR Smith and Shumpert.</p>

<p>Once the Cavs got beaten badly in back to back finals, he jumped ship to the Lakers.</p>

<p>Got them to trade all their young guys and picks for AD. Was also looking to get another star to sign with the 2nd max contract slot the Lakers had. Now the Lakers cupboards are bare after chasing guys to surround Lebron.</p>

<p>Take the 2nd best player away from every single championship team in the last 50 years and I bet very few of them would have still won without them. Maybe the 80&rsquo;s Showtime Lakers would still win. Outside of that, can you name a single team that would have 1) still made it to the Finals and 2) would still have won the Finals if you take away their 2nd best player? Nah.</p>
