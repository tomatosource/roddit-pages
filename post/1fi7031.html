      <label for="lng6ad2" class="commentText"><p>First and foremost I would not rate Heatles post 2012 as  a super team with how much Wade declined due to his knee injury.</p>

<p>Coming on to your Bosh point, Yes bosh did take the biggest reduction in offensive involvement as he became tertiary next to LeBron and Wade as love did next to LeBron &amp; Kyrie but unlike love, bosh consistently provided value as a decent defender and was a solid stretch 5 for that time. Love while  did provide  a great deal of  spacing and was a great connective passer in his relegated role as an tertiary, he bled a lot of it back with how bad he was defensively. Also remember due to him losing a lot of weight, even when he was asked to post up he just wasn&rsquo;t that good at capitalising those plays as he was in his Minnesota days</p>

Nothing against Love, but he wasn&rsquo;t nearly as accomplished and was not even considered a hof candidate at that time.<br>
Just tagging a great team on good form (Love was also quite inconsistent irc) as a superteam is quite inappropriate tbh</p>

Love was NOT capable of being the main guy or even the 2nd guy on winning team. He was a star in Minnesota, but that doesn’t mean he was that great on the cavs because he wasn’t. I would say he was still very good, but he wasn’t great or star player level which is what would’ve made them a super team, he was an elite role player and it wasn’t because that was what lebron wanted (incredibly stupid comment by the way lol) it was because that was what the team needed from him in order to win.</p>

<p>Dropping 34 in a quarter one time doesn’t mean he was a great, star player the entire season lol especially considering it was against the blazers. If thats the logic you want to use though im sure you think Tony delk was a great player because he had a game where he scored 53 yet averaged less than 10ppg for his career, but that doesn’t matter cause he scored 50 once.</p>

      <label for="lnfoqld" class="commentText"><p>how was it not a superteam? Love averaged <sup>19</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> and shot 37% from 3pt that season and 45% from 3pt in playoffs. that was the season he had the 34-point quarter too</p>

<p>that was probably his best year as a Cavalier</p>

      <label for="lnfu2j1" class="commentText"><p>Love was always ass in the playoffs.  Couldn&rsquo;t defend anybody aside from steph on exactly one key possession.  Fg% was usually putrid too. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there were entire series where he shot like 16%.  He was so invisible sometimes nobody even bothered mentioning him as somebody that needed to step up in big games.  He was basically a floor spacing defensive rebounder role player.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that one big quarter was the only time he ever played well in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Like I&rsquo;m super happy about that defensive stop of his on curry in their championship year, but even in that series, the cavs blew out the warriors when love was injured.</p>

      <label for="lnfv4be" class="commentText"><p>Love being a bad mismatch vs. Warriors doesn&rsquo;t mean Cavs still weren&rsquo;t a superteam. Love still cooked vs. all the East playoff teams. that&rsquo;s like saying Heat weren&rsquo;t a superteam cause Lebron got locked up by JJ Barea and the Mavs</p>

The steph stop, the one huge quarter in Toronto, and I remember he once had a really nice high effort block out of nowhere.  I think that&rsquo;s about it for his highlights. On the other hand, look up his stats against Indiana in the playoffs for example.  Hel, Mozgov has had more big moments in the playoffs than love.</p>

<p>Al Horford, One of the best underrated big men of this era, said this - &ldquo;It was Game 7 and I’m looking at my teammates and we’re gassed. And I look at the other side &amp; he’s leaning very causally. He’s played every single minute up to that point, and he looked unfazed. To me that was disturbing.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lng7x9c" class="commentText"><p>Easily that 2018 entire playoff run was a different beast but his 2015 and 2017 finals performances are extremely underrated simply because he lost. Only player in history to average a triple double in the finals, was so good he was the first player since Jerry West to get FMVP votes on a losing team. We will very  likely never see something like that and most probably will never see something like his 4 finals run from 2015 to 2018.</p>

<p>I personally dislike that KD made that decision. But no organization is going to turn down a great player wanting to sign with them. I only was drawing a parallel.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we as fans need to accept that in this era with the power that superstars have, more and more players are going to join together to increase their win chances.</p>

<p>say whatever you want about KD, his legacy would probably be worse off if he had stuck around in OKC without winning one instead of going to GS and getting it done. look how consistently the lack of rings is brought up when discussing guys like Barkley, Ewing, Harden etc.</p>

      <label for="lng9bmz" class="commentText"><p>idk if they would have. tbh whether KD publicly admits it or not I feel like he had grown tired of playing for the Thunder. maybe it was bc WB had a tendency to play hero ball in clutch situations, or bc he was sick of playing in a system with loads of defensive attention on him every single play and absolutely awful spacing (which Presti never did much to address even during the PG years)</p>

<p>I feel like it’s probably the latter given that he did publicly admit that he wanted to play in a more free-flowing system where he could trust the other four guys on the floor more than he could in OKC</p>

I remember the narratives back then, and the warriors were an embarrassment. Honestly if the Warriors hadn&rsquo;t lost in such an embarrassing fashion, KD wouldn&rsquo;t have had the balls to make a move like  joining a 73-9 team.</p>

<p>Out the top 3 stars of this era, Curry has had the advantage of always being on the best organization with the most stability. (minus the past 3 years) KD almost had that if Russ was just a better decision maker and if Harden was able to stay. Meanwhile Lebron had to rot in CLE for years and leave to get a taste of a competent organization and turn into LeGM</p>

There was never a narrative of gsw being an embarrassment 😂 people were rightfully praising lebron the rest of the cavs more than criticizing the gsw. It took one of the greatest individual finals performances of all time and the greatest 2 player performance to beat them. There’s nothing you can say that will ever put kd above curry. For the last decade, Lebron was obviously by far the greatest, curry was 2nd and KD 3rd with a big gap between each of them.</p>

<p>this series was a lot closer than ppl remember</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason &ldquo;close&rdquo; means very little in basketball. I&rsquo;m in a rec league and there&rsquo;s a team in there that has been undefeated for 5 years. Every team has played &ldquo;close&rdquo; games against them and feels that it means something. It doesn&rsquo;t. Teams don&rsquo;t need to run up the score. They&rsquo;re happy to wait and turn it up when they need to.</p>

As a grown man, you can’t put your destiny in the hands of another man. However, he lost all of that for me when he played around in Boston. That team was already there, and he should’ve been the alpha to put them over the top. He really could have had an incredible legacy had he performed there. Then he tarnished his legacy, as well as KD and Harden in Brooklyn. All 3 of them would have top 35 arguments in an all time list had they won in Brooklyn.</p>

Are they running 25% as fast as they could if they tried with a max effort?</p>

      <label for="lngnf1t" class="commentText"><p>I hope you do understand that defense started to change after 2015. Basketball defense in general has become I don&rsquo;t want to say non existent that isn&rsquo;t true. But teams do not play the same type of defense like before or run schemes like before. The game is way too offensively driven and one on one at times. It&rsquo;s killing the actual enjoyment for the sport. Players have too much freedom offensively now and the refs give you everything since any touch is now considered a foul as well. It&rsquo;s a problem, and that&rsquo;s why those ranking don&rsquo;t mean anything to me.</p>

      <label for="lngo8x9" class="commentText"><p>I think you need to watch that 2017 finals again and remind me where teams played defense. Because the only defense was actually played throughout that whole series is probably at the end of game 3. And even still it was open shots here and there. That series was too much talent on both sides and was who can score more faster. It was never about getting stops and slowing down the other team. It just never happened that series, they were all either 15-20 point leads constantly being cut back and forth till it ended in either  a blow out.</p>

Both teams like I said didn&rsquo;t play a lot of defense. And considering defense today isn&rsquo;t the same as either 2000s or early 2010. The standard on how to defend has changed everything is considered fouls</p>

<p>2014 Spurs ran into Mavs and OKC and beat both in 6.</p>

<p>Ghost of Dwade Pretty sure he averaged 20ppg that 2013 finals.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re forgetting a worse version of Spurs in 2017 with Kawhi and Alridge were up 20 + against 2017 warriors. And you don&rsquo;t think the likes of 2013 Heat or 2014 Spurs isn&rsquo;t competing lol</p>

<p>2014 mavs and the baby thunder don&rsquo;t move me at all, if anything the teams you are talking about pushing your supposed defensive super teams to 6 and 7 show me they would get smoked by either 2017 final team who both swept their conferences bar 1 game.
The 2014 spurs also didn&rsquo;t play against 2013 dwade they played against 2014 score 15 ppg in the finals on 44 percent shooting dwade, aka a ghost of his prime self</p>

<p>The 2017 spurs being up for one half against a team literally know for coming back and blowing teams out in the 3rd quarter has got to be the most overblown what if in nba history.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think either team is getting swept but neither has the star power to keep up with the 2017 teams considering great offense always beats great defense.</p>

      <label for="lng8hcz" class="commentText"><p>What’s hard to understand? Bron said “we’ll be back”, clearly he was talking about the following year.. who was back the following year? Lebron. Got his ass swept by the greatest team of all time but at least he carried his team to the finals.. and like I said, he did it again a few years after and won it. Kyrie changed teams 3 times in 7 years and was the 2nd (even 3rd) option the entire time including when he made the finals again.</p>

Once Kyrie realized he couldn’t lead a team, he got a reality check, publicly apologized to Lebron.</p>
