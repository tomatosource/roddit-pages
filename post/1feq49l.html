      <label for="lmq5hjf" class="commentText"><p>Irrespective of the number of followers, Wilt would definitely be someone dripping in controversy if his career were to take place in a more modern age. I mean, during his own time, he was known for being kind of a dick.</p>

<p>Verbally abusing officials in case they weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;properly recording&rdquo; his stats. Ditching dates to chase after women he deemed better looking. Being pro-nixon, hating on the black panther party and being famously absent from the Cleveland Summit where a gathering of famous African American athletes came together to defend Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s decision to refuse the draft. Bill Russell and a very young Kareem were in attendance there, but Wilt was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Wilt as a player was a spectacle for sure, a sight to behold. But the smooth talking showman isn&rsquo;t who he really was.</p>

      <label for="lmrwi7m" class="commentText"><p>To explain the Chumperlane comment, it requires a bit of backstory.</p>

<p>Russell and Kareem were both good friends with Wilt despite his rather egregious character flaws but he fell out with both of them because of his ego.</p>

<p>During the 69 finals, he was injured in Game 7 but instead of fighting through it, he practically subbed himself out and the Lakers lost. Russell, among others I might add, made a harsh comment regarding Wilt sitting out the rest of the match. Over that one comment, Wilt didn&rsquo;t speak to Russell for decades. They only made up because Russell eventually reached out to apologise, even though what he said wasn&rsquo;t deserving of the punishment.</p>

<p>In the case of Kareem, Wilt was his sporting idol, mentor and close friend during adolescence. But Wilt was bitter that Kareem was entering the spotlight as Wilt was leaving it. After retiring, Wilt became hyper critical of Kareem and often vented with made up slander, which came off as him being bitter and jealous. Jump a bit into the future, when Kareem broke the scoring record during 84, rather than celebrate the career of his old friend, Wilt doubled down on his behaviour, talked even more shit about Kareem and told him to retire. (Kareem would go onto win a ring and the finals MVP one year later, quite funny that)</p>

<p>When Kareem retired, he wrote a section in his book which was an open letter talking mad shit to Wilt, which was 100% deserved. Of course, Wilt was quite the gentleman about this response and so they feuded until Wilt passed away.</p>

<p>Those are two people who were close to him and gave him respect though he didn&rsquo;t always deserve it. And his ego got in the way of both of those relationships. That&rsquo;s Wilt Chamberlain.</p>

      <label for="lmr55a5" class="commentText"><p>The youth vote? Wilt began supporting Nixon after Dr King was assassinated, Wilt was 32 years old at the time. The youth vote has nothing to do with my point at all.</p>

<p>Wilt was constantly quiet on issues of social injustice, segregation, racism etc A far cry from his contemporaries like Ali and Russell who were, as you might already know, famously outspoken about these issues.</p>

<p>Ali lost his prime years to the boxing ban and Russell was targeted and abused throughout his career in Boston. Neither of them gave up the fight. They both took the abuse head on and continued to be the best of the best. Ali came back from the ban and won the title again. Russell won titles as a player and then as a player-coach.</p>

<p>If you ask any older person about sporting heroes, Wilt Chamberlain isn&rsquo;t one of them. He&rsquo;s a legendary basketball player, one for all time, but nobody views Wilt as a hero. That&rsquo;s his legacy.</p>

<p>Obviously we get a lot of US politics and it&rsquo;s history thrust upon us</p>

<p>For some reason I figured both Nixon and Reagan were in very much the same lane and no way like a young African American (very generally speaking of course cause there&rsquo;s obviously some who would for their own reasons) would vote their way.</p>

      <label for="lmrx531" class="commentText"><p>Nixon was on the right wing of the soc dem New Deal coalition while Reagan was an insurgent who was a part of the evangelical and liberal wing of the republicans. The party was already shifting considerably in the 70s but when Reagan took over as president it marked a complete break from the old status quo.</p>
