      <label for="lmq5hjf" class="commentText"><p>Irrespective of the number of followers, Wilt would definitely be someone dripping in controversy if his career were to take place in a more modern age. I mean, during his own time, he was known for being kind of a dick.</p>

<p>Verbally abusing officials in case they weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;properly recording&rdquo; his stats. Ditching dates to chase after women he deemed better looking. Being pro-nixon, hating on the black panther party and being famously absent from the Cleveland Summit where a gathering of famous African American athletes came together to defend Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s decision to refuse the draft. Bill Russell and a very young Kareem were in attendance there, but Wilt was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Wilt as a player was a spectacle for sure, a sight to behold. But the smooth talking showman isn&rsquo;t who he really was.</p>

      <label for="lmqmbsl" class="commentText"><p>As a non American this is very interesting to hear.</p>

<p>Obviously we get a lot of US politics and it&rsquo;s history thrust upon us</p>

<p>For some reason I figured both Nixon and Reagan were in very much the same lane and no way like a young African American (very generally speaking of course cause there&rsquo;s obviously some who would for their own reasons) would vote their way.</p>

      <label for="lmr55a5" class="commentText"><p>The youth vote? Wilt began supporting Nixon after Dr King was assassinated, Wilt was 32 years old at the time. The youth vote has nothing to do with my point at all.</p>

<p>Wilt was constantly quiet on issues of social injustice, segregation, racism etc A far cry from his contemporaries like Ali and Russell who were, as you might already know, famously outspoken about these issues.</p>

<p>Ali lost his prime years to the boxing ban and Russell was targeted and abused throughout his career in Boston. Neither of them gave up the fight. They both took the abuse head on and continued to be the best of the best. Ali came back from the ban and won the title again. Russell won titles as a player and then as a player-coach.</p>

<p>If you ask any older person about sporting heroes, Wilt Chamberlain isn&rsquo;t one of them. He&rsquo;s a legendary basketball player, one for all time, but nobody views Wilt as a hero. That&rsquo;s his legacy.</p>
