</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Looking at some of his shooting numbers in the playoffs. 6 of 24 (25 percent), 8 of 27 (29 percent), 15 of 35 (37 percent), 5 of 26 (19 percent), 10 of 32 (31 percent), 5 of 27 (18 percent). He literally had 6 straight terrible shooting games. I know people call him relentless and he had to shoot a lot because of his team. But geez, couldn&rsquo;t he scale it back a bit lol</p>

      <label for="llzviap" class="commentText"><p>But look at the teammates he had.  Besides Mutumbo on the way down (who wasn&rsquo;t gonna pour in points anyway), he had Eric Snow and Aaron McKie as his 2nd and 3rd options.  They had very little offensive presence in the paint on those rosters.  AI did have flaws, but with a better group around him they would not have mattered as much.</p>

      <label for="llzxlaz" class="commentText"><p>You make a very valid point.  I lived in Philly at that time and was a fan of these teams. The roster construction was very frustrating.  Tyronne Hill is not a player that can start for a team that wins the Championship.</p>

<p>Larry Brown, though not the GM, definitely seemed to have the hubris necessary to say, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who the players are, if they follow my instructions, we will win.&rdquo;  I don&rsquo;t have any inside info though, and it was a time when teams were still trying to win based around one superstar.</p>

<p>If Iverson ever had an elite teammate, our collective view of him might be even more impressive.</p>

      <label for="llzyoxv" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re the one who framed this post around the 2001 team, where it definitely did work. They had the #6 offense among the 16 playoff teams by offensive rating, and outside of Aaron McKie, it&rsquo;s not like other guys were scoring more efficiently on any significant volume, even though Iverson got them pretty good looks. In 2001, that was absolutely their best option.</p>

<p>And in other years, his usage was generally lower, he was generally more efficient, and they still lost. So I don&rsquo;t know if the 10 years thing supports your point. Their best year, by far, was the year when he wss forcing the most offense himself. </p>

If after 15-20 seconds of dribbling around, he couldn&rsquo;t get a shot off, he&rsquo;d pass to him teammates who had to chuck it up, then he&rsquo;d get frustrated with them. I knew then what we know now. He would never win with his play style.</p>
