It’s such a brain dead take ( most nights if he goes 1-15 just stop shooting lol) that it doesn’t make sense sometimes. I don’t care if the star on my team shoots less that 50% a couple nights, but if he’s filling up a stat sheet like this, not in garbage time; and not padding stats then why does efficiency always come into play? The only stat that matters is a win or loss.</p>

I think it&rsquo;s because he is consistently the best overall player on the team, but for his (very) high ceiling he could occasionally lower his floor beyond what was reasonable or necessary, sometimes at the expense of a W.</p>

<p>Beyond excellent team structure this year, he has rehabbed that part of his game to great effect over the last year. This finals team shouldn&rsquo;t create controversy in that way but here we are.</p>

      <label for="lcjz48v" class="commentText"><p>Overall, season long, I 100% agree JT&rsquo;s the better defender (you&rsquo;ll find comments in my history arguing he&rsquo;s our best defender, even over the two all-D guards.) But in the context of that series? Nah, bro. JT did not shut down their offense, the <em>team</em> did. It was a master class in coaching. If you came away from that series with the take that JT &ldquo;took away their whole offense&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t know ball.</p>

<p>JT&rsquo;s 5 work was great, no doubt. Put a stranglehold on the lobs, cut them in half or more by himself. But Jrue and White put a stranglehold on the corner 3&rsquo;s with a similarly extreme cut to those types of shot attempts. That&rsquo;s just as important as the lobs for the Mavs offense as a whole since that&rsquo;s the spot their spacers shoot well from.</p>

<p>And whenever defense wins a FMVP it&rsquo;s always the on ball guy like Kawhi&rsquo;s first or Iggy. I&rsquo;ve never seen a guy win it for his off-ball defense, and I don&rsquo;t think this series should be the first. Brown was the lynchpin for the whole scheme, taking it to the best 1v1 scorer in the league defensively without calling for help. When guys have to rotate to double suddenly they&rsquo;re not doing their own jobs, they&rsquo;re not taking away the lob or the corner. And you only need to look at Luka&rsquo;s efficiency to understand how well he played that role.</p>

<p>All they had to do was not help from the corners lol it’s very simple. They didn’t even have to rotate often considering we never doubled.</p>

<p>No the lobster were the most important. The lob game is what forced teams to help out of the corners.</p>

<p>It’s not just defense Tatum was better in literally every single way outside of fg%.</p>

<p>We allowed every switch Luka wanted it wasn’t like JB was fighting through screens to guard him. We had damn near whole quarters where Luka was getting a mismatch with Al on him. Also Luka still shot 47% from the field lol.</p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s the point.</em> You can&rsquo;t run a scheme where we never double if the guy on the ball is getting cooked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We allowed every switch</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true. But excluding the game four surrender, JB still had the most possessions on Luka by a significant margin in every game, and the most Luka shots defended in every game except game 1 (Al.) He fought through more screens than you give him credit for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>47% from the field</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if we look at the true shooting instead of the flawed metric Luka&rsquo;s efficiency fell by roughly 10% compared to his season average. A top 3 foul baiter in the league wasn&rsquo;t getting to the line because nobody, but especially JB, was biting on his fakes.</p>

<p>The thing is we had 4 guys in our starting lineup capable of guarding Luka on isos including 2 bigs who could also. Luka wasn’t gonna iso his way into beating us.</p>

<p>Tatum taking away the lob game and by attachment the corner 3s completely shut down the Mavs offense. Jrue or Dwite could’ve spent more time on Luka and we would’ve been fine, no person in the league let alone in the team could do what JT did as a wing.</p>

<p>For example, Jokic, Luka, etc. Have defensive flaws, so their teams need to overcompensate with  the roster construction. This can come at the expense of building a well rounded roster with a good bench.</p>

<p>Rewarding Tatum for how well his team does when he’s off the court just doesn’t make sense. And Boston has an objectively amazing supporting cast, everyone else is a good defender too, so I’m not sure how Tatum specifically allows anything special about team construction here</p>

<p>Basically any superstar would fit in Boston</p>

Like Jokic&rsquo;s is otherworldly because the Nuggets bench was horrific, if he was on the Celtics he&rsquo;d more likely be +13-15 which is still insane.</p>

<p>He also had a better season imo than everyone on 2nd team except Brunson who I was surprised didn&rsquo;t get the nod over him (especially since he finished 5th in MVP to Tatum&rsquo;s 6th).</p>

<p>In 2021-2022 when he had a more typical team comp in line with what these guys had (a borderline all star (even though JB didn’t make the team) and 3-4 solid starter level guys-similar to these other teams) he was a +14 on/off.</p>

<p>That said I think you’re just in your feelings over the Celtic’s Larry (and the fact that we have a few more likely coming up), so I’ll let this lack of ball knowledge slide.</p>

<p>but if he’s filling up a stat sheet like this, not in garbage time; and not padding stats then why does efficiency always come into play?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because getting the most out of every possession is how you win in basketball? If anything is stupid its volume stats. He clearly isn&rsquo;t bad but the narrative around him is so confusing. There are people that argue he is bad which is stupid and then people that are like well actually its good he shot 35% from the field.</p>

<p>It is annoying also that he tries to say he doesn&rsquo;t try to force his shot, but he still shot the ball the most on the celtics and definitely had more than a few unecessary shots. He&rsquo;s clearly really good and probably won&rsquo;t have a series like that again, but I think some criticism of his play in the finals is fair.</p>

<p>Wins are a team acomplishment, so justifying things with a win is a win is kind of pointless when we&rsquo;re talking about individual performance. The scariest thing about the celtics and why they have to be massive favorites to win this year is Tatum will very likely play better in the playoffs this year and if he does they will dominate. I think several of their lowest scoring games were in the finals this year which could be attributed to the pace and how effective their own defense was, but also partially due to Tatum&rsquo;s inefficiency. If they have normal offensive performances in a series they are going to obliterate teams more than they did this year.</p>

<p>What determines who wins the game?</p>

<p>Does the team with the higher TS% get the W? The team with the higher BPM? PER?</p>

<p>Or is it the team that wins the &ldquo;stupid volume stat&rdquo; called Total Points Scored?</p>

<p>In 2021 the Bucks had a 56% TS, and the Suns had a 59% TS. Mikal Bridges had a higher TS% than Giannis, and DeAndre Ayton had a higher TS% than Khris Middleton. Ask the Bucks (or Suns) if they care who won the &ldquo;TS% Title.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You win the game by scoring points, and stopping the other team from scoring more. If it takes you 20 shots with 10 offensive rebounds to score 20 points, and the other team scores 16 on <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> shooting with no offensive rebounds, you still win.</p>

      <label for="lckg0i1" class="commentText"><p>He does force too many long step-backs and he&rsquo;d be even better as a player if he did that less. Also, obviously, the team would not be so good if they weren&rsquo;t really deep and didn&rsquo;t have the most well-rounded group of 5-8 guys in the league.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s still true that one big reason Tatum is a top (not THE top, I know) player is that he contributes in a lot of ways. There are plenty of really talented guys that become net negatives on their team the dozen or so games a year they go like 6 of 20 from the field.  But the fact that he does all the dirty work, fills whatever role is needed, cares about screens, defensive effort, clearing the boards, etc, means he&rsquo;s got a much higher floor than almost anybody else in the league, even if his ceiling is slightly lower than Jokic or Luka (and this is a guy who had a 51-13-5 game 7 with 0 turnovers, so his ceiling is still pretty high).</p>

<p>And yeah, with a less talented team, he&rsquo;d win less even with all that &ldquo;other&rdquo; stuff he does. I don&rsquo;t see why some people (not necessarily you) are using that to dismiss his &ldquo;I want to contribute to the team even if there&rsquo;s a lid on the rim for me on a given night&rdquo; attitude altogteher.</p>

      <label for="lcjkuyy" class="commentText"><p>This is just a straw man argument against the problem that people tend to have with him as a player. No one said he isn’t an impactful winning player.</p>

<p>The argument was always that if he wanted to be considered an MVP level player, the best player on a championship team, etc, that he had to get more consistent - especially when it comes to efficiency. He still isn’t, and that’s why Jaylen Brown won FMVP (and eastern finals MVP).</p>

<p>Again, no one (who’s actually serious) thinks he’s not a winning player, not impactful, etc. the point of the conversation in terms of the “counter-hate” he gets for the people who want to call him that next man up is that he’s not that guy to lead the team when it gets tough.</p>

<p>That still hasn’t happened. He’s still evolving as a player and that’s fine, but that counter argument against him does still hold merit.</p>

<p>But again, it was weird this year because there really was no clear-cut best player in the Finals. Whether brown or tatum got it I think it would be deserved on both sides.</p>

Gafford/Lively, who had been playing amazing all playoffs, all of a sudden were non-factors. Turner, who has killed the Celtics before due to his ability to space out our big men and hit above the break 3&rsquo;s on the pick and pop, also really didn&rsquo;t have a good series.</p>

<p>It enabled the Celtics to keep either keep the opposing team&rsquo;s big men out of the PnR on offense or keep our big men out of the PnR on defense.</p>

<p>The important thing is that Tatum, though giving up size, was not giving up offensive rebounds. Obviously, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about someone like Turner with that, but Gafford/Lively are good in that regard and he held his own against them on the boards.</p>

Then you have the fact that he might not weigh as much as some of these centers, but after his bulk up this past year, he&rsquo;s strong, and more athletic than practically all of them. So him guarding a center other than the truly huge ones like an Embiid or Wemby or something isn&rsquo;t really giving up anything.</p>

      <label for="lcisz8a" class="commentText"><p>The real trick of the Tatum 5 was that normally, that switch puts the X5 on Luka, which freed the Lob Goblins up to go to the rim because the other team&rsquo;s big man was out of the paint. This is why Gobert kept ending up on Luka out at the arc. With Tatum as the &ldquo;5&rdquo;, when that switch was made, the Cs could then pre-switch KP so that he was free down low, and we&rsquo;d still have a center waiting in the paint to break up the lob, without sacrificing defensive quality because you&rsquo;re going from JB to JT as the man on Luka, which means you don&rsquo;t need to send the double. Really smart gameplanning by the Cs, you could tell it stumped Dallas, and they reverted back to hero ball magic from Luka and Kai once their corner 3 and their lob was taken away. They reminded me a lot of the &lsquo;22 Celtics, they didn&rsquo;t have a consistent way to buy a bucket, so once you solved the core offensive set they run, their output collapses.</p>

      <label for="lcj8nig" class="commentText"><p>Yep, really impressive gameplan, Mavs offense fell apart when the C&rsquo;s wouldn&rsquo;t send a double and Luka had nowhere to go with the ball. Great point about the KP switch down low but Tatum still did serious work defending the lob, it was crazy to see Tatum as big as Gafford and able to push him around.</p>

      <label for="lcja8b4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Tatum needs to be able to play the 5 for it to work at all. For an extreme example, if the Celtics had put Pritchard on Lively, the Mavs wouldn&rsquo;t even have ever called for the switch. They would&rsquo;ve just sent the ball down low and watched Lively dunk all over him. So Tatum needed to defend their centers well enough that the Mavs felt the need to run their switch play to begin with. Basically, the Celtics got all of the advantages of the double big without needing two bigs on the court because of JT&rsquo;s versatility on defense.</p>

      <label for="lcjigom" class="commentText"><p>He was -1.5% TS relative to league average for the first 3 rounds and then -7.5% in the finals. He&rsquo;s consistently been a league average true shooting player in the playoffs which is a slight dip from his regular season % which is normal.</p>

<p>In the playoffs from 2020-2023 he was 57.1% true shooting which is in line with league average for that period. This year he was 54.9% which is -3.1% worse than league average.</p>

<p>Jokic and Luka&rsquo;s incredible offensive output and passing talent is the trade off you make for their lack of elite athletic traits or defensive prowess.</p>

<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s a limit, but I&rsquo;d rather have a guy who is barely passable defensively and amazing offensively, than vice versa</p>

<p>Why can&rsquo;t it be both? I don&rsquo;t see why people are using the stacked team as a way to dismiss a change in mindset from &ldquo;I evaluate how good of a game I played solely by whether the shots went in&rdquo; to &ldquo;To play well I need to rebound and play defense and not just care about scoring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obviously that mindset is going to help win on a stacked more because <em>every single thing you can possibly do right</em> will be more effective on a stacked team than not. But that doesn&rsquo;t dismiss the mindset altogether.</p>

That’s an awesome place to be and basically any franchise would take him on their team. You can ding him a bit for not making shots but it’s obvious that stats can’t capture everything when it comes to evaluating a player’s value in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lclhokk" class="commentText"><p>He says this and then he still is taking 20 shots a game, with a lot of them unforced midrange jumpers. Not really buying it. But for sure he is a great player and contributes a lot beyond scoring, I just think he&rsquo;s basically done all those things since day one of his rookie season, he&rsquo;s just better at them, especially guarding bigger guys and boxing out, since he started to bulk up. But his shot selection and volume is still outrageous at times.</p>

Playing within the confines of your winning strategy when it&rsquo;s working isn&rsquo;t stupid.  Disregarding it in pursuit of individual stats and awards is.</p>

I mean FFS, the guy has had multiple 50-pt games in the past (he has five 50-pt games vs JB&rsquo;s one) and has even averaged more points than Jaylen in the finals despite Jaylen&rsquo;s more consistent shooting in the series.  He gets double/triple-teamed every time he drives to the paint so he kicks it out to the open shooter.  That&rsquo;s not even talking about Mazulla&rsquo;s demand of his players to keep chucking 3s, shooting-slump be damned - because the &ldquo;Mazulla Math&rdquo; believes the 3s are just going to align to their high average at some point.</p>

The top players don’t hide behind their teammates when they’re at the peak. If Luka isn’t hitting shots they get crushed, if KD is off his team is dead in the water. if Jokic isn’t getting <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> they’re out, if Shai isn’t hooping his team is on their way to the offseason.

<p>So your rationale is for Tatum to&hellip; emulate these guys who can&rsquo;t win when their shots aren&rsquo;t falling? 😂  It&rsquo;s not Tatum&rsquo;s fucking fault that they can&rsquo;t elevate those around them or that they don&rsquo;t do what he does in trying to affect other aspects of the game to win when his shot isn&rsquo;t falling. That&rsquo;s such a stupid fucking take.   We&rsquo;ve been there before where Tatum&rsquo;s shot isn&rsquo;t falling and the team didn&rsquo;t win - and your brilliant take is that we go back to that?? LOL. 🤣🤣🤣 FOH dude.</p>

      <label for="lckqrvk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and it happens a few games a month if even, not an entire long ass stretch. Thats the difference between being a good player and a legendary one. Sure you can “just play defense” for a game when there’s a lid on the rim but you can’t do that over and over if you’re supposed to be a superstar in this league. Joker, Giannis, and even Shai are not deferring to teammates and playing 2nd or 3rd wheel for long stretches.</p>
