<p>Shai isn&rsquo;t a terrible off the dribble 3 shooter. Not last year. He was not very good going into last season. He&rsquo;s improved but hasn&rsquo;t been necessarily a rise up and fire 3 point guy overall. If that&rsquo;s a part of his game he scales up on this season and the 3 point volume in general&hellip;watch out.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost like Clips have had the literal worst possible outcome and OKC has had the best possible outcome (depending where this year&rsquo;s pick lands).</p>

<p>Like just SGA becoming what he is as a perennial MVP candidate nets it a win for OKC as it&rsquo;s just so hard to get a top five player in the league. I was always a believer but really only had SGAs ceiling at the time as a 25 / 5 / 5, second best player on a championship team. He is now possibly the best Playoff scorer in the league as he can&rsquo;t truly be stopped.</p>

If he can consistently add this to his game it will be undefendable because of how explosive he gets on his first step coming off the crossover.  Defenses will be even more off balanced trying to guard this guy in isolation if they have to close and worry about the pull up 3.</p>

<p>i think sometimes people put too much weight in these numbers on their own, but last season he was comfortably ahead of both Jokic and Giannis in EPM, and Embiid&rsquo;s ludicrous number there came of course in only 39 games.</p>

<p>In fact, Shai&rsquo;s +8.8 EPM last year is a higher number than every season that trio has put up except for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Embiid&rsquo;s limited campaign last year (+10.5)</li>
<li>Giannis&rsquo;s 19-20 season (+8.9)</li>
<li>Jokic&rsquo;s 21-22 season (+9.2)</li>

      <label for="lrbbxk6" class="commentText"><p>EPM is one of the stat that overrates Shai defense especially last year. Lebron, multi year RAPM, Darko all think of Shai as a slightly positive defender (which he is) and not a better defender than Chet, for example. I don&rsquo;t have access to historical EPM like I do other stats so I will take your word on that.</p>

<p>Giannis/Joel/Joker all dominate him on all those other metrics. You cant surely think SGA is better or more impactful defender than Giannis/AD like EPM said last year. Shai and guard defense is overstated by EPM due to stl%</p>

      <label for="lrd1bj0" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think Shai is top 3 or even top 4 (although the Embiid argument is clearly the injuries, specifically in the postseason).</p>

<p>But I would like to argue this since nobody actually ever wants to argue Shai’s defense.</p>

<p>Aren’t DARKO and multi year RAPM both multi year stats? So they both take career into account for their projections? Why would that matter if Shai seemingly took a defensive leap in the eyes of every advanced analytic, including EPM?</p>

<p>(You should never compare EPM across positions btw)</p>

<p>And you say EPM overrates steal percentage. Caruso, Shai, and Suggs are all near the top for guards and also for steal percentage. But the rest? Westbrook, Fox, Mitchell, CP?</p>

<p>Every advanced analytic that projected based on 2024 season alone said Shai was elite. He was fourth in the NBA in stocks surrounded by all elite defenders, he’s surrounded by elite guard defenders in LEBRON, EPM, obv the worse stats like DBPM, etc. Decent on/off, even without Chet. We gush over stocks for played like Caruso or Matisse or White (blocks specifically), but for Shai there’s hesitance. Why is that?</p>

      <label for="lredv2e" class="commentText"><p>Darko and Lebron, RAPM. Raptor all got a yearly component. Which also doesn&rsquo;t rate Shai defense as well.</p>

<p>SGA is less impactful than Dort/Jalen Williams and Chet and he takes on easier assignment than all. D-EPM is saying he is the best defender on the team (same D-EPM that rated him much worse the previous seasons btw). You are missing the point, SGA was good on defense last year (more active) and played on a very good defense and his minutes held up (so he should be rated well), the problem is how good he actually was. Steph has had seasons were he was rated higher on D-epm than you would expect due to him being on a great defense/tethered to Dray and having decent defensive counting stats.</p>

<p>Caruso is a much better defender and he takes on assignment from the elite guards/wings consistently. D Mitchell plays on a elite defensive team and lot of mins were with Allen (defense was elite in those mins) so he gets overrated on D-EPM too. I  am not  saying the sole reason SGA is that high up is STL%, I am saying it overrates guards in general.</p>

<p>I can give SGA the slight edge on offense against bigs like Embiid/Giannis due to his role even if you can argue it. You cannot seriously argue Shai was more impactful than Gobert/Giannis/AD/Chet on defense last year. SGA does not take on the elite assignment nor does he deter shots at the rim enough. But D-EPM is not as clean as O-EPM which is why you see more random names at top. I watch a lot of SGA and I  can  say he  is a fine defender, he just is no where close to a top 20 defender in the league as D-EPM rated him last year.</p>

      <label for="lreuedi" class="commentText"><p>No, LEBRON rates Shai very highly, as one of the best guard defenders in the entire NBA last year. RAPTOR also rates him extremely highly for guard defenders as well, were you looking at 2022 lol?. RAPM had him at a +2.2 defensively last season. I can’t find the single season DARKO ratings, but I immediately see Jokic is near the top and Shai is actually near … Tatum? This stat has even more weird rankings than EPM lol.</p>

<p>You kind of just disproved your own point there lol&hellip;all these stats have the same story - Shai was slightly above average most of his career and then near elite last season. Which is inline with the eyetest and his tracking metrics as well.</p>

<p>I don’t think eye test with a Thunder fan who watches every game is a strong argument either. I know why Shai is more impactful than non OKC (and some OKC) fans may think. Saying someone like Jdub is better is insane, and the assignment argument is just the obsession with one on one defense. Our team depended on overhelping last season because is size and Shai is objectively one of the best help guards in the NBA, arguably right after Caruso and Thybulle. People overrate Dort as a POA but don’t acknowledge that when he’s not actually thwarting a star, or gets forced to switch (remember, overhelping) his impact is very low overall. Which is why his impact is more poised for playoff environments.</p>

<p>Draymond is an advanced stat darling, he dominates everything. That makes sense why he’s able to tether Steph. But Chet had great advanced analytics, not elite ones. Shai’s DEPM was higher than his, Shai’s on/off defensive numbers are better than his too. No, I don’t think Shai is better than Chet defensively, I’m saying that there are enough indicators that Shai’s numbers exist without Chet unlike for Steph or Mitchell or whoever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you cannot seriously argue Shai is more impactful than Gobert/etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I agree completely. EPM and all defensive metrics should be used to compare defensive roles/positions, not across them. Thats not my point at all, my point is he was one of the best guard defenders in the league last year. And this notion that he’s just a “slight positive” or anything less than great is <strong>backed up by nothing.</strong> And you kind of just helped me prove that further lol.</p>

      <label for="lrf649l" class="commentText"><p>Darko last year rated SGA as 0.2 on Defense (195 ranking in the league). Lebron rated SGA as 0.9 on defense  (73rd ranking). Raptor rates is am a 0.3 on defense (version made by someone else since Nate Silver stopped).  EPM rated him as a top 15 defender in the league! The reason he is a slight positive to me is because of his role, he is a very low activity defender. The on/off minutes thing is likely just shooting variance and lineup shuffle. I can probably guess OKC plays one of Dort/Chet a lot with SGA in his minutes or even the other decent defenders. Otherwise SGA defensive on/off would be a lot better in 2023. You are right RAPM did rate him better than I thought last year mostly due to on/off at 2.0 but still that is not a top 15 defender. In 2023 RAPM rated him as (397 in league). Did he improve that much after one year?</p>

<p>Jokic is a decent defender even if its a bit overrated cause he is very active with his hands with deflections/steals and an great defensive rebounder (so Nuggets don&rsquo;t give up a lot of 2nd chance when he is in). Their bench lineups also stink which overstates Joker. Which is why he rates well on both D-Lebron and D-Darko.</p>

<p>I am glad you are not arguing Chet vs SGA lol. Non Shai but chet lineups seem to be worse on offense which in turn makes the defense worse. Btw SGA D-EPM will be lower this season just due to more lineups they put out being good on defense when he is off the court (due to caruso/IH).</p>

<p>Just so you understand my argument is SGA is not close to a top 20 defender in the league. If you think he is a strong defender for guard w/e but I can name 10 guards better. I consider him slight positive overall when comparing to every bigs/wings/guards defenders in  the league.</p>

      <label for="lrfeazi" class="commentText"><p>His LEBRON was 0.92 which is stronger than “slight positive.” The <strong>only</strong> guards ranked above him are Caruso, Suggs, Daniels, White, GP2, and Keon Ellis. All of those players are considered elite defenders, and two of them were low minute. Who follows him? More great defenders - Thybulle Lowry, KCP, Dunn. Etc. According to LEBRON, if all defense was still position locked, they would have had Shai making it lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RAPTOR rated him 0.1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where are you seeing this? His defensive RAPTOR (or eRAPTOR since raptor isn’t being updated anymore) was 1.8 which was 41st in the NBA, and 10th amongst non low minute guards. It seems like DARKO is the only stat that doesn’t rate his defense, which makes sense since it’s a predictive stat.</p>

<p>DARKO thinks Tatum is the best offensive player in the NBA lmfaooo</p>

<blockquote>
<p>low activity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I just explained, he is the an elite help defender on a team that prioritizes help defense. How is that low activity? Hes third in the league in deflections and fourth in stocks surrounded by rim protectors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>plays with one of Dort or Chet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except he doesn’t. A bulk of SGA’s minutes actually comes without them. Shai without Chet/Dort on the court had a 108 DRTG. Chet without Shai/Dort? 112. Dort without Shai/Chet? 120. Chet + Dort and no Shai? 116 lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jokic is a decent defender.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bro bro bro lol. You can’t say “Jokic is a decent defender, look at all of his deflections! Hes very active!” while in the same breath saying Shai is a LOW activity defender despite ranking third in THE LEAGUE in DEFLECTIONS. You just contradicted your own point lol.</p>

<p>Look, the point I’m trying to make is whatever avenue you want to use to make a defensive argument, none of them suggest he’s a “slight positive.” I’ve never once argued he’s all nba caliber, I’m just saying at minimum he’s very good and there’s no argument any other way.</p>

<p>I like SGA and if his 3 pointer really is improved then he can challenge for top 4 in the league. But at the moment he is not that much better on offense than Joel/Giannis to make up for the defense edge they have on him. Those guys are very elite rim protectors.</p>

      <label for="lrbbx9i" class="commentText"><p>At least you are consistent. The difference with Shai, and even Luka imo compared to guys like Embiid and Harden is they are still making basketball moves and trying to make the shot, while also trying to draw fouls. They aren’t just flailing their bodies randomly like Harden and Embiid do. The foul drawing that Luka and Shai do is a skill to get opponents into foul trouble, the flopping Embiid and Harden do is just gross non basketball moves.</p>
