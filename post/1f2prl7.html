</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The internet has long been searching for the truth behind the story behind Mats Wermelin.</p>

<p>In 1985, the Guinness Book of World Records stated that &ldquo;Mats Wermelin (Sweden), 13, scored all 272 points in a 272-0 win in a regional boys&rsquo; tournament in Stockholm, Sweden on Feb 5, 1974.&rdquo; That was it. No further clarifying information.</p>

<p>7 years ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6wzvhi/in_1974_13yr_old_mats_wermelin_scored_272_points/" target="_blank">this thread</a> was posted on the NBA subreddit, quoting a now-defunct Dime Magazine article. It picked up some traction, but nobody really had much to offer in terms of clarifying information. The next year, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9cglt4/mats_wermelin_the_greatest_basketball_player_that/" target="_blank">TheMason15 posted essentially the same thing</a>. No answers.</p>

<p>For decades, people have been asking themselves: What the hell happened?</p>

<p>Well, if you want to read about the full journey to finding out what went down, <a href="https://backpages.substack.com/p/mats-wermelin" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>, but let&rsquo;s cut out the flack. After a loooooot of searching throughout the corners of the internet, I found the story told in Swedish, by our hero, Mats. Here&rsquo;s my writeup about how the game came to be.</p>

<p><strong>In the early 1970s, Swedish youth basketball ran through Hammarby BC. Located on the fringes of southern Stockholm, the young program dominated at all age levels and divisions. All of their teams enjoyed impressive levels of success, but the U13 team in 1973 was the best one by a mile. After three years of playing together, they still had yet to lose</strong> <strong><em>a single game</em></strong>. <strong>The squad was easily the best in Stockholm. It was the best U13 team in Sweden. Odds are, they were the best in all of Northern Europe. And the face of that team, bringing up the ball every possession? Our 5’8” protagonist: Mats Wermelin.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Around this time, there was an annual tournament based in Stockholm featuring basketball teams from all around Sweden. Naturally, Hammarby dominated, winning the entire thing three times in a row.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The fourth time around, new management took over for the tournament, and all teams had to re-register again. New qualifying divisions were created from scratch, and teams were being matched up against others that had no business being in the same groups as them. The road to history was being paved.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hammarby BC won their first group game, 172-2. Game two was even more of a blowout, with a final score of 199-0. The face of the team, Mats Wermelin, had 78 and 65 points, respectively.</strong></p>

<p><strong>After the group stage, there was a free draw that involved</strong> <strong><em>all of the teams in the entire tournament</em></strong>. This meant that Hammarby would be matched up against the worst squad in the entire competition. Their coach saw this draw as an opportunity to make history.</p>

<p><strong>After seeing these absurd final scores, Hammarby’s head coach was starting to think about records. He did some research with the Swedish Basketball Association, and found out that some kid from Hageby, a small town across the country, had scored 106 points. That was the national mark to beat.</strong></p>

<p><strong>His plan? Do it in the first half.</strong></p>

<p><strong>According to Mats, the plan was to only chase the record for the first two frames. The team would come out in a full court press, and get the ball to him for every shot. After halftime, the second best player, Johan Dahlstedt, would try to break the record as well. There was some debate over which of the two was better at the time amongst the team, but Mats was the best shooter on the team by a mile. The debate was settled. History time.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hammarby came out in a</strong> <strong><em>lethal</em></strong> <strong>1-3-1 press. They trapped the corners. They attacked ball handlers. They forced turnovers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And then they got the ball to Mats, who was waiting around the basket to lay the ball in.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There was</strong> <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> <strong>the other team could do to stop them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mats says that over the entire game, their opponents crossed half-court with the ball a maximum of six</strong> <strong>times. They hit the rim once. They hit the backboard another time. That was it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>At halftime, the score was 152-0. Wermelin had all 152 points. Now it was time for Dahlstedt to make his run at history.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Except… Dahlstedt didn’t want to.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The coach shrugged and looked around. He asked another kid if he wanted to chase the record. He also said no.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The show still belonged to Mats.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The squad walked back out there in the exact same press, and Mats continued to wait for the ball. After another half of the same, the final score was 272-0. Mats had scored all 272 points in the game. He mentioned that despite the historic barrage, he still managed to miss a couple shots from the field, and estimates his shooting percentage to be between 80 and 85%. The Swedish record was his. Hammarby went on to win the tournament with ease.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It wasn’t until a few days later when Aftonbladet, a Swedish daily newspaper, found out about the result of the game. They called up the head coach and said that Mats had broken a world record. News spread locally, then nationally. Guinness World Records would be calling soon.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For a couple years, people locally knew him as the guy who scored 272 points in a game. The expectations were a tall order to live up to. Wermelin went on to play professionally in Sweden for a couple of years, but he never grew much taller than 5’8”. He continued to play at a high level, participating in national events as recently as 2009, before unlacing his sneakers for good.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Today, Mr. Wermelin is an operations manager for JENSEN education, an education administration program located in Stockholm, Sweden. Every now and then, people ask him if the story is really true. He smiles, and says that it was. He misses his playing days, but is still happy with the life he’s lived. Mats’ career may be behind him, but the significance of his record is something he still feels every day.</strong></p>

<p>I get that it doesn&rsquo;t seem like they had much choice in being that much better than the other teams, but the level of sportsmanship displayed by a coach to have a bunch of 12 year olds put this plan into practice seems questionable.</p>

<p>50 years ago is not long ago. Why do you think it&rsquo;s not possible for us to know the culture of Sweden in the 70s?</p>

<p>Can you help me out with Earth? They say it&rsquo;s a sphere, but I&rsquo;ve never seen the whole thing in person. There&rsquo;s no way to know without experiencing it from space myself.</p>

<p>The fact remains, you simply can&rsquo;t understand a culture and all of its incredibly nuanced intricacies by reading about it on the internet. You <em>have</em> to live it. Now, I&rsquo;m guessing you live a very black and white type of life so when you heard me say this your mind jumped to &ldquo;you either lived it and understand it or you didn&rsquo;t and understand nothing.&rdquo; Not true either. The truth is always in between. Remember, don&rsquo;t assume a person&rsquo;s stance is at the extreme. That is usually wrong.</p>
