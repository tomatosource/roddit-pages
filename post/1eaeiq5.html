Isaiah Stevens, Josh Christopher, Pelle Larson, these are all title contender additions that now have championship experience.  Add to that they brought back Bryant who is a champion. Josh Richardson who is good enough to play for the champions in Taiwan.</p>

<p>We’ve added caliber players, kept all our assets, and have built a contender as seen by our recent title. Anything less than A+ is just pure bias and fear</p>

<p>I could see the Warriors giving up 2 picks for him and maybe one of the young guys, and I’m sure there are other teams who would have been interested. But saying “no extension” kills any value (not that we were looking to trade him in the first place)</p>

      <label for="lelm889" class="commentText"><p>There’s a difference between being a good defender and can’t play defense. The defensive rating has been top 5 the last two years with Herro on the court, better than when he’s off the court, and watching him he’s average.</p>

<p>The issue wasn’t defense last year, it was the lack of scoring and health</p>

<p>Then Caleb gets treated like this huge loss when in reality he didn’t have a great year and took a step back from 2023. That’s not to say he’s bad but at the end of the day he’s another average role player that they can replace.</p>

      <label for="lem5qom" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I agree. Caleb was extremely replaceable. Highsmith is essentially already a replacement with more untapped potential imo. Highsmith is a little less aggressive off the catch, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s all bad. I also think Keshad and Pelle will fill Caleb&rsquo;s role and arguably be an improvement before the season is over. I do wish we could&rsquo;ve gotten something for Caleb, but it seems like other teams didn&rsquo;t value him either. Our fans get really attached to moments and forget who that player is, while simultaneously holding guys like Herro or even Jimmy to the gold standard. I am a little worried about Duncan&rsquo;s back issues; that doesn&rsquo;t bode well for NBA speed defense. But, I&rsquo;m less worried about Tyler. I&rsquo;ve seen him improve every season so far and he&rsquo;s still only 24. Excited to see Kel&rsquo;el&rsquo;s development path at his young age too.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bucks had nothing to work with and got some big upgrades for the bench</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve heard for 2 years how Mitchell is leaving Cleveland, but he signed an extension</li>
<li>Magic got KCP and Bitadze back on a cheap deal</li>
<li>Knicks made some huge moves and getting Brunson for the biggest steal extension vaults them near the top imo</li>
<li>76ers got so many good players and the best guy on the market&hellip;without giving up draft picks</li>
<li>Celtics kept the championship core together and I think White is on a steal of a contract</li>
</ul>

<p>Pacers didn&rsquo;t do anything, but idk what they <em>should</em> have done either. Heat&hellip;well&hellip;&ldquo;they like their team&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not sure if I would have done much differently if I were the Pacers, but just nothing really to get excited about from the off-season moves.</p>

<p>The excitement for the Pacers comes from what happened last season and the playoffs, especially if Nemhard is for real.</p>

<p>The Bulls didn&rsquo;t want to go in the luxury tax as a lottery team looking to tank by picking up Harrison Barnes for a 2031 Sacramento pick swap. </p>

Nobody would have had an issue with us making this type of move for an elite offensive player with huge question marks on D. Instead we got an elite defensive player who is pretty damn good as a 3rd option of offense, which fits in perfectly with our current squad. I’d rather trade 5 picks for him than the first option.</p>

<p>my issue is that the knicks with OG had like a 107 DRTG, which would have been the best in the NBA. the last thing they needed realistically was another defensive wing, especially since their center rotation is now mitchell robinson and jericho sims. they spent five first round picks on a position of strength when they have a clear weakness</p>

Either they’re too good to be traded (Giannis, Embiid, Jokic, you know the names) or they’re not good enough to have made that much of a difference. OG is injury prone so Mikal is insurance for that, but more importantly, you can never have too many wings that can score and make life a living hell for the opposing wings. Especially when your biggest threat’s best two players are wings.</p>

      <label for="lelbk9j" class="commentText"><p>i’m not sure who is actually on the market right now, but i know walker kessler is certainly available for the right price. OG is injury prone, but so is Mitch, and you don’t have <em>any</em> insurance for him.</p>

<p>all in all, it’s a good trade because yeah, you can never have too many wings that are great defenders and can also create their own shot. my only issue was the amount of capital they gave up, as well as the fact that they seemingly ignored the center position thus far.</p>

<p>the celtics have two great wings, but they also have porzingis and horford, not to mention teams like Cleveland, Milwaukee, Miami, and Philly all have damn good front courts that the knicks are also going to have to contend with.</p>

      <label for="lelcgcp" class="commentText"><p>I think the FO really thought they had a shot at convincing Hartenstein to take a pay cut to stay, and are willing to do what it takes to fill the hole either this offseason or at worst before the trade deadline next season. But we all know Ainge is trying to fuck over whoever he’s dealing with so I’m guessing the Kessler asking price is ridiculous, and not sure the FO wants to get fleeced for picks again in the same offseason as the Bridges trade. I agree it was too much but I’m glad we did it. Not many teams can say they only have one serious hole and it’s back up center.</p>

      <label for="lelk6ah" class="commentText"><p>The author in October 2020:</p>

<p>“I don’t think the Heat will make it back to the Finals during Jimmy Butler’s contract.</p>

<p>I doubt they’re getting Giannis. I don’t think they’re better than the Celtics or Bucks next year, or the playoff Nets. A lot of things went right for them that I don’t view as sustainable.”</p>

<p>So Miami had a disappointing offseason because they didn’t overpay for Caleb Martin?</p>

<p>Also the dude mentions Gabe Vincent and Kyle Lowry as players Miami “lost”. Dude, there’s a reason they aren’t in Miami anymore lol. They were let go by Miami.</p>

<p>The plan?</p>

<p>It has always involved having a healthier squad than previous years. If you give me Jimmy, Bam, and Tyler for 70 games a year then I’d put quite a bit of money on Miami winning 50 or so games.</p>

<p>Miami has four young bucks that are part of the present and future (Tyler, JJJ, Jovic, and Ware), the ceiling depends on how much they develop.</p>

<p>Either way, trading Jimmy like homeboy is arguing, is ridiculous.</p>

      <label for="lele8la" class="commentText"><p>Genuinely the first year in a while I think the Sixers did <em>fantastic</em>. Even ignoring the PG thing, they&rsquo;ve struggled a fair amount due to their playoff roster just having so few players you&rsquo;re happy to give minutes to and this is the first year I feel like they&rsquo;ve made it a priority to address that and find good pieces to fill in an already strong roster with just Embiid and Maxey alone.</p>

<p>I think if the Embiid injury bug stays away or stays &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, this team is really really capable of making a good push for a championship</p>

It was a problem through the first half the season under AG. It wasn&rsquo;t the main issues under Doc. Their defense through the second half of the season was actually pretty good. The biggest issues the bucks ran into were lack of bench scoring, inconsistent 3 point shooting as a team, and health.</p>

      <label for="lel268s" class="commentText"><p>From my homer perspective, you guys certainly had zero backcourt defense every time you played the Knicks. Brunson would go off for 35-45 points every time like it was nothing. So I wouldn’t say defense wasn’t a problem. Also, your initial comment mentioned nothing about first half vs second half, you just acted like the Bucks never had to worry about defense all last season before you clarified your stance</p>

      <label for="lel3jff" class="commentText"><p>A lot of guards cooked us, but we still won most of those games. The way the defense functioned was to force mid range 2 pointers which meant we gave up a lot of those to driving guards. Overall the defense was still pretty good through the second half of the year. It could have been better and it wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was definitely not their biggest issue which is what this article seems to be saying.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mention 1st vs 2nd half of the season because it was very obvious to anyone that watched or followed the team, and my point was the guy who graded this clearly did not. He&rsquo;s basically saying &ldquo;they still haven&rsquo;t addressed their defense&rdquo; but they did in the middle of last season with a scheme change.</p>

      <label for="lem6n3s" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I mean realistically I&rsquo;m not sure if even a healthy Bucks can take down the Celtics. You split with them last year (every game definitely had some contextual things though like B2B, Giannis sitting or the Celtics not playing for anything if I recall) but overall it never seemed like you really clicked fully.</p>

<p>Maybe the slight upgrades imo depth wise will help and just another year. But it just seems on paper the biggest problem for the Bucks is their core is another year older aka health.</p>

It was a bit of a mess of a season. Coaching change mid season and a bunch of guys missing time throughout to year. When we actually had our starting 5 healthy and playing they were dominant. I think they have the strongest starting 5 in the league. Unfortunately they didn&rsquo;t get a ton of minutes together last year from all the injuries.</p>

<p>But because Morey has so many media members on his dick they&rsquo;re all convinced PG on this deal now is better than Harden on a cheaper and shorter deal woulda been back then 🤣🤣</p>

The 76ers aren’t getting PG on the basis that they won’t have Embiid and he has to take a lot of shots, because they won’t have a chance anyway if Joel isn’t healthy.</p>

<p>PG was 23/5/4 on good efficiency and good defense. They added him without giving up any assets. It’s objectively a huge improvement from Tobias Harris.</p>

<p>He barely took on defensive assignments tf you talking about lol. He passed everything off to Mann, Coffey, and Kawhi to preserve his offense because he wanted to dribble iso dribble even though he was inefficient at it.</p>

<p>What saved his efficiency was the catch and shoot opportunities fed to him by Harden which gifted him a career high in spot up PPP.</p>

<p>Over the last 3 years PG is averaging 0.83, 0.91, and 1.03 ppp on ISOs which he wants to do more than those catch and shoot shots.</p>

<p>PG is also averaging like 45 games played a year</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true - Harden did an interview after he got in LAC and said he would&rsquo;ve been fine to give them a deal if Morey talked to him. But after like 10 years of constant communication Morey went ghost and Harden thought he was about to get fucked so he opted in and wanted out.</p>

<p>You just don&rsquo;t hear those sides of Harden&rsquo;s story because Morey pays a lot of money and bandwidth to keeping media on his side</p>

<p>And who said I’m here just believing Moreys side. You’re so entrenched that Harden is 100% truthful here that you’ll ignore anything you don’t agree with an call it irrelevant.

<p>Look at the actions. Harden has ACTUALLY turned down plenty of max contracts to favor basketball situations, given multiple payouts, and just went into his most recent negotiations offering to take even less than they gave him (he went in saying he&rsquo;d take under 30 annually and they offered him 35, which he agreed on a 2 year 1+1 deal so they can retool in the 2nd year if needed.</p>

<p>Who cares about media mouthpieces? They say all kinds of shit.</p>

      <label for="lel8vv5" class="commentText"><p>So me saying Harden leaking he’s going back to Houston all year is blindly believing every Morey report. Again, you’re making a lot of assumptions about my beliefs when I said one thing. Something obviously happened between the two. You don’t go from a good 10 year relationship to this. Neither you nor I know what it was. But what I can do is make the argument that there’s no reason to believe Harden would take the same deal that he got from LA when 1. He was leaking he would leave without a significant contract. 2. He still believed he was the main the guy and deserved that money. When he got to LA he took a pretty massive change in role and seemed to recognize where he stands as an NBA player. It worked out well for yall. That wasn’t his mindset here in Philly. You could see it in the playoffs vs Boston. He put up 40 pieces and believed he could do that every night when hes just not that player anymore. A lot can change over an offseason and the following year, especially as you age, and it looks like it did.</p>

<p>And I know you’re going overtime in this comment section to prop up Harden,  but the absolute reality is that Morey would’ve given him his max had Harden held up his end of the bargain.</p>

<p>Both sides took a risk,  Harden bet on himself to be a playoff difference maker for the Sixers and to show he was still an MVP caliber player.   Neither of which were accomplished.  Thus, Morey changed his mind and rightfully so.  Even when it wasn’t the popular thing to do.</p>

      <label for="lekzwqo" class="commentText"><p>Sixers getting an A is wild lol.  I mean yeah basically going from Tobias &ldquo;2 FGAs in an elimination game&rdquo; Harris to Paul George is definitely an upgrade.  Other than that it&rsquo;s pretty much the same and they&rsquo;re just going to run it back hoping this time it plays out differently for the umpteenth time.</p>

      <label for="lel3urt" class="commentText"><p>They also added Andre Drummond, Caleb Martin, and Eric Gordon, all upgrades from last year.</p>

<p>Replacing a useless player for the best guy on the market should probably at least get the team an A-, but then you add in the other moves</p>

<p>I think they did all that without trading a draft pick too</p>

      <label for="lelgsni" class="commentText"><p>My issue is that these moves are mostly floor raisers than ceiling raisers.  It certainly fixes things short term mainly next season for sure.  I don&rsquo;t like the long-term security of them, though.  Like PG is obviously an upgrade but taking a step back, paying 34yo PG $50m/year for the next 4 years is crazy.  Overall the main players they&rsquo;ve gotten are as good as they&rsquo;re going to be.  However there&rsquo;s no player they can sign that makes Embiid healthy and they just got to pray he does.</p>

      <label for="lelpwjq" class="commentText"><p>Well all their title hopes rely on Embiid being healthy, so whatever moves they make beyond that don&rsquo;t matter a whole lot. I think having these guys with a healthy Embiid makes them one of the top title contenders. I also don&rsquo;t think you can think too long-term with Embiid. Who knows how long his legs will hold up?</p>

      <label for="lel88bp" class="commentText"><p>This is just objectively false lol.   The Tobias contract has been a yearly 40 million dollar black cloud for 6 years preventing us from being able to fill out the bench and have much flexibility to do anything.</p>

<p>We were getting docked draft picks for being desperate to sign the likes of Danuel House for god sakes.<br>
It’s refreshing to see a full roster with actual NBA role players and bench vets.   Now they have to deliver.</p>

      <label for="lel1tvr" class="commentText"><p>The upgrade over Tobias Harris cannot be understated. The rest of our team is better too, namely at backup C which has been a black hole for us in the playoffs. So many games Embiid would play like 40 minutes and be +15, but we’d lose by 2 points because in those 8 minutes off the court the team would go -17. And we re-signed Maxey, although that was always a given</p>

<p>Yes, everything will rely on Embiid’s health again, but purely judging by the offseason the A is deserved imo</p>

      <label for="lel2sxq" class="commentText"><p>I think bucks should atleast have a A</p>

<p>Our bench was the biggest issue defensively, our starting 5 had the best defensive rating of every other starting 5. Our best bench defender was Beverly.</p>

<p>We upgraded crowder, Beverly and Beasley. Who mostly were all ass aside from the first half of the season with Beasley.</p>

<p>Wright and Prince aren’t world beaters but they are an upgrade over Beverley and crowder.</p>

<p>nah i am depressed we couldnt pay hartenstein but other than that its been fine….prolly shoulda kept burks too after how clutch he ended up being for us but i guess cam payne will help fill that role</p>

<p>but securing OG / Bridges should warrant a C alone even purely for defense</p>
