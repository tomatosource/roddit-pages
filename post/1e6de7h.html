      <label for="ldslivy" class="commentText"><p>When Carmelo joined the Knicks, he could have waited for free agency and the Knicks would have had the cap space to sign him AND be able to keep the guys they traded for him. The Knicks would have had a lot more depth around Carmelo/Amare and really could have competed against the Heat.</p>

<p>Instead, Carmelo somewhat forced his way out of Denver more quickly. I believe in part was that he was worried about the upcoming CBA and wanted to secure a better contract sooner. So it&rsquo;s kind of hard to blame him, but imagine his legacy if he had a team that was really able to go toe to toe with Miami and have some deep playoff runs. He might be as beloved as Brunson is now (not that he&rsquo;s hated).</p>

      <label for="ldsyuon" class="commentText"><p>It’s crazy to think the Melo trade was almost 15 years ago. My memory is a little fuzzy, but if I remember correctly, Denver had Melo’s bird rights and was able to pay him the most money. A trade was the best option for all parties because…</p>

<ul>
<li>Denver was able to get assets back.</li>
<li>Melo was able to get the biggest contract.</li>
<li>New York didn’t have to risk Melo going to Brooklyn instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Would it have been better for New York to wait until the offseason to sign him as a free agent? Probably, but they didn’t want to take that risk. Denver reportedly had a significant trade offer from Brooklyn and likely would have traded him there if New York hadn’t made a more favorable offer.</p>

      <label for="ldt146s" class="commentText"><p>Denver getting assets and Melo getting paid are certainly wins for them, but getting Melo at exhorbitant cost was <em>not</em> a win for NYK.  We&rsquo;d have been better off keeping the assets and continuing to build for the future rather than going all in for a mediocre team that had no chance to really compete.</p>

<p>Letting him go to Brooklyn wouldn&rsquo;t have been the end of the world, as it wasn&rsquo;t when Brooklyn got <em>three better players than Melo</em> in a single summer shortly thereafter.</p>

They didn’t give him a rookie extension and didn’t offer him anything the following year as an RFA. They told him to go get an offer and they’ll match. So when it was time for the next contract he just didn’t want to be there.</p>

<p>Btw, you are pretty much the only person answering the OPs question, so good job on that. Most of the answers are about players like IT, Sprewell, Noel, and Schroeder who should have taken deals that were offered to them, but ended up fumbling the bag.</p>

I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious if the Celtics knew what was going to happen, they wouldn&rsquo;t have signed him. Both for being stuck with an albatross of a max contract on a should-be Title contender, but also for Hayward&rsquo;s long-term health.</p>

<p>Beal did the right things if you connect the dots, Westbrook was in WAS.</p>

<p>He wents from signing a max deal in OKC, to traded to Houston, then Washington and then booed out of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Beal was right to take less money for the NTC if they are loyal, put it in writing because there is no telling where this contract can land him.</p>

The question is along the lines of who took a big contract over better fit/situation and it screwed their chance at a better career/legacy. Most of the posts here are more about fumbling the bag. The Melo 5 yr contract preventing him from joining the heatles is the only one I can really think of. Yeah ppl are saying it wouldn&rsquo;t have worked but really, no one knows. At the very least, he would&rsquo;ve had the opportunity.</p>

      <label for="ldsgpz3" class="commentText"><p>At the Olympics in 04 they made the plan to play together, Lebron and Wade signed a 3 year deal, Melo signed a 5 year deal, so Lebron and Wade convinced Bosh to sign a 3 year deal as well.</p>

      <label for="ldsm640" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this was speculation. Might not have happened but melo signed a longer extension with denver instead of a short deal that would&rsquo;ve expired at the same time as Bron and wade. But who knows if Riley signs melo.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand reddit sometimes. If disliked people make objectivly nice moves, it can&rsquo;t be aknowledged.</p>

<p>Same with that Paul kid, that turned his career from edgelord youtuber to semi professional athlete and people can not respect it. I dont get it.</p>
