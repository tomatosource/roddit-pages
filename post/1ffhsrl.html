<p>Spurs fans will tell you he doesn’t fit their timeline. If Wemby becomes an All NBA player next year, does Trae Young suddenly fit the timeline? The guy is only 26 years old. It’s rare for a guy at that level and age to get traded.</p>

Maybe they aren&rsquo;t a fan of Trae&rsquo;s character? That&rsquo;s backed by nothing but Spurs are very picky.
Are the Spurs just waiting until the Hawks are desperate? We&rsquo;re in no rush but the Hawks are in a very tight situation and they want their picks back, which we don&rsquo;t really <em>need</em> but it&rsquo;s nice leverage in case the Hawks get desperate</p>

Elite playmakers like that don&rsquo;t grow on trees.</p>

And if castle pans out as point guard (which trying to develop talent is the goal of any rebuilding team) then it unlocks a style of roster construction we can’t have with Trae, where at every position we have big lengthy defence oriented players and can switch everything, and create a truly suffocating defence.</p>

<p>Spurs have 0 reason not to be patient right now. They have tons of options, their core is still very young and Atlantas stance on moving Trae likely doesn’t change at all between now and a years time.</p>

<p>I do think there is the option for the Hawks to thread the needle and keep Trae while using use some combination of the picks they got from the DM trade and that Kings pick to get some pick control back even if it&rsquo;s not all 2 picks plus the swap a la what the Nets did with the Rockets but that&rsquo;s predicated on them not using those picks to make some anti-tanking &ldquo;bring in vets&rdquo; moves to upgrade their roster ie replace Clint Capela</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a very tricky needle to thread regardless, and I think it&rsquo;s worth questioning whether their GM, a former Raptors legend, is up to the task</p>

<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s not an easy trade to negotiate regardless of whether they go the Trae Young trade or a pick-related trade to get control back because of that aforementioned leverage the Spurs have and thus they are less incenticivsed to make a trade that forfeits 2 potential lottery picks and a swap that, if the Spurs are on timing, can be equally valuable in its own right</p>

<p>The fact that none of those picks have any sort of protection, and the fact that the haul included another pick for Dejounte Murray, it never ceases to baffle me</p>

The only realistic pathway is to trade with spurs to get all their picks back but why would spurs entertain that. Upcoming draft is projected to be great and guard heavy, any top 5 pick would get you a long term prospect to built with wemby. Any trade with Spurs would be an all time fleeced job worse than what we fleeced for dejounte, fans would burn atlanta down for real.</p>

<p>Taking unknowns over know, has honestly never worked out for any team.</p>

<p>Warriors should&rsquo;ve packaged their 2nd pick for something to improve their team long term. But they took Wiseman instead and are left with just a championship, the poor babies.</p>

<p>Trae is an all time offensive player. Pair him next to someone who probably will be all time offensive and is clearly on his way to being all time defense, YEESH.</p>

<p>Spurs would be a nightmare for years to come. I do think they should trade their picks for Trae, he&rsquo;d be awesome with Wemby. Shit he was awesome with&hellip; Kevin Huerter.</p>

      <label for="lmuzcg5" class="commentText"><p>Looking at spurs roaster, adding trae wouldn&rsquo;t move the needle, not nearly enough. We are porous on all positions and we need talent especially in the west. The prospect of 3 future 1st round pick (and the potential for trading them for multiple solid contributors to plug in our massive gap in talents) has more upside than just relying on trae and wemby with a skeleton crew. We don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in play-in 6-8 seed while wasting wemby prime, being stuck in mediocrity is worse than outright tanking. And we have hawks to do the tanking for us, too sweet of a deal to move away from unless its all time fleeced job.</p>

<p>Spurs are not in a hurry, we have time to do things right.</p>

<p>Trading for Trae, is securing success for the future and getting Wemby to win games early on. Something I think would be good for him.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re on track to be stuck in mediocrity right now, unless you manage to draft an all time talent in the early first round. Something that the Spurs haven&rsquo;t had in now 13 years.</p>

<p>Presti and OKC development talent like no one else in this league. It&rsquo;s been a long time since Spurs took a rough nothing player and turned them into something better than a role player. Those picks are worthless until Spurs can actually do something with them. Spurs don&rsquo;t draft anywhere near as well as Presti does either, that man has so few misses.</p>

<p>Trading for Trae and using some picks on some highly athletic youth is the best path for the Spurs. They won&rsquo;t do it though, so largely just have to wait to see if Spurs get lucky in drafting someone decent.</p>

      <label for="lmuwc1u" class="commentText"><p>I badly want the Spurs to grab Trae too, but they don&rsquo;t want to trade their picks for him.</p>

<p>They 100% should, but they don&rsquo;t want to. It&rsquo;s a shame too, Wemby and Trae would be&hellip; filthy long term. FILTHY.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating, because you see so many small market fans complain about not getting the top guys. But you gotta take big risks to grab these top guys.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I love the Gobert trade. Big risk, paid off too, first two series win post season in 20 years. Love to see it.</p>
