      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef2x1k/in_2001_espn_asked_users_who_they_thought_the/"><p>In 2001, ESPN asked users who they thought the best player in the NBA was. They received 65,000 votes. The top 5 answers were: 1) Allen Iverson, 2) Kobe Bryant, 3) Chris Webber, 4) Kevin Garnett, 5) Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, 6) Tim Duncan</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240729154252/http://a.espncdn.com/nba/2001/0207/1067862.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We asked you to respond to our theme of who the best player in the NBA is, and, boy, did you respond. In the first 24 hours after we posted our Best Player Index page, a mere 4,000 wrote e-mails (or, as we noticed, maybe about 2,000 of you who wrote to us twice). After three days the total was more than 6,500. Not too bad.</p>

<p>Obviously, certain guys were favored by you, the users, although below we list three e-mails for each of the 10 players we chose (and one humorous e-mail). In a p0ll on the NBA page we received more than 65,000 votes (through mid day Wednesday) and no player was getting 20 percent of the vote, proving how wide open this debate is. The leader in the clubhouse was Allen Iverson, followed by Kobe Bryant, Chris Webber, Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, all getting between 11 percent and 20. Tim Duncan, surprisingly to us, was around 8 percent. Then came Vince Carter, and the bottom three of Gary Payton, Jason Kidd and Tracy McGrady were getting very little love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this very interesting to see, as if you ask NBA fans TODAY who the best players in the league were in 2001, the list will look very, very different. The advent of advanced stats, people forgetting the greatness of some players and looking at others with rose tinted goggles etc etc. I think it is a fun conversation to revisit</p>

      <label for="lfi6lil" class="commentText"><p>Tbf tho, in 2001 CWebb was coming off a 27/11/4 season in 2000-2001 and was seen by many as the best PF in the NBA, also a very popular player - obviously, Duncan would put an end to that soon after but this really wasn&rsquo;t that hot of a take at the time. As for Shaq being so low, he just wasn&rsquo;t as popular w/fans back then as the players who polled above him and that&rsquo;s really what this was, a popularity contest</p>

<p>NBA fandom&rsquo;s opinion of Shaq today is very different from what it was in real time during 2000-2004, everyone acknowledged his greatness and how good he was when he cared, the issue is that he didn&rsquo;t care very often and often was either hurt or out of shape.</p>

<p>Shaq was one of the most efficient scorers ever won the mvp than came in Second to Iverson than completely steam rolled Iverson in the Finals</p>

<p>It’s pretty ironic to talk about “how people viewed the game then vs now” and then have your argument be completely narrative based while ignoring the factual evidence that disproves the narrative</p>

<p>You’re doing the same thing, you’re just going off a narrative you’ve decided you like more</p>

      <label for="lfihd9f" class="commentText"><p>Efficiency is not a meaningful comparison there. Can’t compare center vs guard shooting efficiency when Shaq never shot long range. Also, Kobe was 2-3% above league average TS% those years so it’s hard to conclude that he was inefficient. Efficiency was lower that era because of the heavy defense/physicality due to the rules at the time. It was just much harder to score.</p>

Back then, efficiency wasn&rsquo;t something they prioritized like they do today.  Shit, that Philly team that went to the finals this same year was basically setup so Iverson could get as many shots up (even very tough ones) as humanly possible and everybody else just rebounded and played defense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hard to expect fans to view the game the way it&rsquo;s viewed today when the players/teams themselves weren&rsquo;t even looking at it the way they do today.</p>

<p>As far as that 76ers Finals team, him carrying them was as designed. They went out and acquired defensive specialists to surround him with the expectation that they would not be asked to score much. That team was designed to have AI take all the shots.</p>

      <label for="lfksqb9" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Those Finals&rdquo; though didn&rsquo;t happen until months after this poll.</p>

<p>This poll was taken at a time when the Sixers had the best record in the league, when the Spurs had just lost in the 1st round the year before with Duncan hurt, and with the Lakers suffering a hangover from winning the year before with Kobe and Shaq feuding with each other in the media (and Shaq missing time with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/news/2001/0130/1050858.html" target="_blank">planar fasciitis.</a>)</p>

<p>The Sixers fell off a little bit that year after this, still finishing with the East&rsquo;s best record (and 3rd best overall), and AI won the MVP. It&rsquo;s really not surprising at this time period that a lot of people picked him as the game&rsquo;s best player.  They probably would not have a year earlier or later, this was just the absolute peak of the perception of AI.</p>

This survey was Feb 2001. AI was well into his MVP campaign year. But Lakers would wind up as one of the most dominating postseason teams, period. Peak Laker dominance, but MVP votes split.</p>

<p>By contrast Company Time resulted in the Lakers getting the 5th seed and the Spurs beating the lakers in Western Conference semifinals, signaling the end of Laker dominance.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to bet, you can <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/" target="_blank">look it up.</a></p>

<p>55% of American adults had internet access in 2001. And its heavily skewed by age - around 70% of adults 49 or younger had it, and only around 14% of those 65+ did.</p>

<p>But yes, broadband penetration was &amp;lt; 10%, and video sharing/streaming was extremely difficult pre-YouTube (2005).</p>

      <label for="lfkrj8q" class="commentText"><p>Yes there wasn&rsquo;t widely available broadband or videos online, but back then everyone watched games on TV and SportsCenter, so it wasn&rsquo;t like nobody got a look at these players. Social media and YouTube has replaced traditional media like TV, but it&rsquo;s not like there weren&rsquo;t any ways to see these players or games back then. As someone who&rsquo;s roughly Shaq&rsquo;s age and who has been an NBA fan since the 80s, I can tell you it was not difficult at all to be very familiar with all of these players and to regularly see them all play.</p>

Shaq shooting free throws was amazing! They weren’t just bad but entertainingly bad. Giannis shooting free throws is so long and boring. But it means I have time to go to kitchen or bathroom more often.</p>

      <label for="lfijmuk" class="commentText"><p>I was in college during that time.  Shaq and Kobe probably split the vote.  You either thought the Lakers success was due to Shaq or due to Kobe.  Plus Shaq being a poor free throw shooter really hurt his overall stance with a lot of fans.  </p>

<p>Allan Iverson was probably the most popular player in terms of style and swag.  Every kid in the park wanted to imitate him.  He affected the game with his crossover and driving like Curry did with his shooting.  </p>

      <label for="lfkscln" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, no idea what this dude is talking about. Feels like he was not around and this is the typical view of somebody who looks at that time period from today POV. Shaq was never seen as the clear cut best player in the league for an extended period like Lebron or MJ were. He had an insane season in <sup>99</sup>&frasl;<sub>00</sub> but from 01 onwards it wasn&rsquo;t even clear if Shaq was the best player on his own team.</p>

<p>For the next two titles, Kobe was more than Shaqs equal during the Western conference playoffs, especially against the Spurs, where the <em>most dominant player ever</em> was traditionally struggling against. But 2 FMVP against average top-teams from the east and 20 years later you suddenly get all these narratives from nephews who obviously did not even bother to watch the games they so confidently give their opinion about.</p>

      <label for="lfiljqz" class="commentText"><p>Yep, it seems silly to look back at now, but LeBron didn&rsquo;t firmly take the title of best player in the world&hellip;until 2012. Kobe was <em>the guy</em> on the 08 Redeem Team and won back to back titles in 09 and 10. LeBron had won a couple MVPs, but his reputation was kinda trash. There was the LeBronze nickname from 04 and failing in the playoffs even after his MVPs had people calling him LeFraud. He was frequently criticized for passing to lesser players rather than taking the big shot, he quit against Boston, and then he had the disastrous finals against Dallas. It took an all-time peak season followed by a title to cement him as best in the league to people at the time.</p>

<p>Kind of goes to show how silly it is to rate everything purely on stats. Watching people live and seeing how they affect the game is a better way of measuring overall impact I think, so AI being this high and Shaq being 5 (game-to-game antics, no ring) makes tonnes of sense</p>

<p>Everyone is in here like only fans thought he was the best because of his “style and swag”, voting was “split” between Shaq and Kobe, these were just casual fans, etc. </p>

<p>What’s left out of this post is that players, fans,  media, analysts all thought he was the best. It wasn’t really contentious. He won 93 first place votes next to Tim Duncan’s 18 for MVP. Shaq wasn’t even second in voting because he didn’t have the dominance during regular season, partially due to injuries.  It wasn’t a controversial award like Westbrook or Embiid either, no one was talking about AI winning only on “narrative”. </p>

<p>During the regular season he was the best player in the NBA. He took the Soxers to the Finals where Shaq didn’t beat him, Shaq AND Kobe did. Mutombo might have been a DPOY but he wasn’t a two way threat or an MVP candidate like both Shaq and Kobe (who were All-Defensive 2nd team each).   </p>

<p>~10 years ago some guy online used advanced stats to argue that AI was the most overrated player in history. This type of “I know you thought X was true, but here’s how the opposite is true” is viral hot take gold and snowballed. That whole narrative evolved over the last decade in to this weird agreement among young fans that AI wasn’t even very good.   </p>

<p>But players and analysts from that era aren’t the ones saying that, it’s young online fans.   </p>

<p>Anyone who actually watched the NBA in 2001 knows that at 6’ he was without a doubt the best basketball player in the world for a brief period of time. It wasn’t for lack of competition either, Tim Duncan, Shaq, KG, and Kobe were playing prime ball. </p>

<p>I’m not saying he wasn’t a lazy defender or inefficient shooter, or that he didn’t eventually stop trying hard and become a poor leader. All that was true, but he was still clearly the best at the time and the concept that he didn’t deserve MVP now playing out 20 years later is not accurate.</p>

      <label for="lfjd205" class="commentText"><p>“I know you thought X was true, but this is how the opposite is true” sums up all basketball talk on Reddit and social media in general now. It’s just debate nerds who like arguing over the same ten topics more than they ever actually enjoyed basketball. It seems like almost every “fan” you see online today started “watching” basketball post-2015, regardless of their actual age. Then they retroactively go back and call every popular superstar overrated, and every superstar that didn’t have a big fan base underrated.</p>

<p>Kobe and A.I. are the two most beloved players, the ones they’ll call overrated (throw in T-Mac as well). Duncan, Dirk, KG, and Nash, the superstars who have way fewer core fans, are underrated. Not only will they call those players underrated, but they’ll also take it to the extreme and say the craziest things in the complete opposite direction. The same people will say Kobe doesn’t have a case for the top 5, but then will turn around and say Duncan has a GOAT argument, KG has a top 10 peak, and Nash is actually the third greatest PG of all time.</p>

<p>The sub is full of people who are dumb enough to think they’re smart but never smart enough to realize when they’re wrong.</p>

      <label for="lfjonyp" class="commentText"><p>If there was ever a year where AI would be in the top 5, &lsquo;01 would be the year.  Just reviewing the numbers that season, it&rsquo;s a pretty solid list. The biggest omission was probably Vince, who was on demon time in 2001.  But that was the season after losing McGrady and Toronto was still trying to figure out what to do.  Still took Philly to 7 games and lost by 1 point.  They could&rsquo;ve easily been the EC rep in the finals that season instead of Philly.</p>

      <label for="lfi9p0c" class="commentText"><p>It is a fun convo and rehashing and the main thing is that analytics <em>did</em> exist then but it wasn&rsquo;t gospel. AI had a level of aura and devotion to his brand that was unrivaled. Kobe eventually matched that but not in 2001. And yes, of course PPG had a lot to do with it. We now look at the data beyond surface level numbers but the &ldquo;pure hooper&rdquo; days were a good time. AI was as pure hooper as it gets.</p>

      <label for="lfj8lgg" class="commentText"><p>They talked about his lower fg% too though. I remember Kenny Smith going on and on about how much effort it took for Iverson to get so many shots off and that people should admire how hard he was working for his team to win instead of calling out the fg%. The argument worked when they were winning! But, it fell flat when he wasn&rsquo;t advancing in the playoffs most of his career.</p>

      <label for="lfiqynn" class="commentText"><p>As a kid I probably would have answered similar. I used to think Shaq sucked and didn&rsquo;t have much skill in the sense that if I had Shaq&rsquo;s body I would be dunking on everyone as well. Iverson seemed like he was the best because he was capable of doing the most and he was small as well. Top scorers also used to shoot in like the low to mid 40s back in the day.</p>

<p>Funny how the narrative was that Shaq only tried in 2000 and fell off (for him) the follow regular season due to not caring until the playoffs, but his numbers were virtually identical.</p>
