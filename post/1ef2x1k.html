      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef2x1k/in_2001_espn_asked_users_who_they_thought_the/"><p>In 2001, ESPN asked users who they thought the best player in the NBA was. They received 65,000 votes. The top 5 answers were: 1) Allen Iverson, 2) Kobe Bryant, 3) Chris Webber, 4) Kevin Garnett, 5) Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, 6) Tim Duncan</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240729154252/http://a.espncdn.com/nba/2001/0207/1067862.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We asked you to respond to our theme of who the best player in the NBA is, and, boy, did you respond. In the first 24 hours after we posted our Best Player Index page, a mere 4,000 wrote e-mails (or, as we noticed, maybe about 2,000 of you who wrote to us twice). After three days the total was more than 6,500. Not too bad.</p>

<p>Obviously, certain guys were favored by you, the users, although below we list three e-mails for each of the 10 players we chose (and one humorous e-mail). In a p0ll on the NBA page we received more than 65,000 votes (through mid day Wednesday) and no player was getting 20 percent of the vote, proving how wide open this debate is. The leader in the clubhouse was Allen Iverson, followed by Kobe Bryant, Chris Webber, Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, all getting between 11 percent and 20. Tim Duncan, surprisingly to us, was around 8 percent. Then came Vince Carter, and the bottom three of Gary Payton, Jason Kidd and Tracy McGrady were getting very little love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this very interesting to see, as if you ask NBA fans TODAY who the best players in the league were in 2001, the list will look very, very different. The advent of advanced stats, people forgetting the greatness of some players and looking at others with rose tinted goggles etc etc. I think it is a fun conversation to revisit</p>

      <label for="lfi6lil" class="commentText"><p>Tbf tho, in 2001 CWebb was coming off a 27/11/4 season in 2000-2001 and was seen by many as the best PF in the NBA, also a very popular player - obviously, Duncan would put an end to that soon after but this really wasn&rsquo;t that hot of a take at the time. As for Shaq being so low, he just wasn&rsquo;t as popular w/fans back then as the players who polled above him and that&rsquo;s really what this was, a popularity contest</p>

<p>Allen Iverson is only one of two players and the only player in the modern era to win the MVP and not have at a minimum a league average true shooting percentage or better.</p>

<p>Kobe also wasn’t an efficient scorer</p>

<p>Shaq was one of the most efficient scorers ever won the mvp than came in Second to Iverson than completely steam rolled Iverson in the Finals</p>

AI had a level of aura and devotion to his brand that was unrivaled. Kobe eventually matched that but not in 2001. And yes, of course PPG had a lot to do with it. We now look at the data beyond surface level numbers but the &ldquo;pure hooper&rdquo; days were a good time. AI was as pure hooper as it gets.</p>

A lot of people thought KG was straight up better than him during their primes, and certainly very few people had him above Kobe. Now he’s being considered above Kobe and if you even compare him to KG people will laugh at you. I don’t know what caused such a sudden shift in his perception</p>

      <label for="lfiaf9d" class="commentText"><p>Other than Shaq (who was maybe taking a hit from Kobe), those rankings are pretty good for that year.</p>

<p>The only reason you&rsquo;d get different answers for those players from people today is that they&rsquo;d be including the broader view of those players&rsquo; careers, i.e. Tim Duncan winning four more championships or Kobe winning a couple without Shaq 9 years later.</p>
