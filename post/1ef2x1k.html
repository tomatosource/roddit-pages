      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef2x1k/in_2001_espn_asked_users_who_they_thought_the/"><p>In 2001, ESPN asked users who they thought the best player in the NBA was. They received 65,000 votes. The top 5 answers were: 1) Allen Iverson, 2) Kobe Bryant, 3) Chris Webber, 4) Kevin Garnett, 5) Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, 6) Tim Duncan</p>
</a>
    </h2>

      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240729154252/http://a.espncdn.com/nba/2001/0207/1067862.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We asked you to respond to our theme of who the best player in the NBA is, and, boy, did you respond. In the first 24 hours after we posted our Best Player Index page, a mere 4,000 wrote e-mails (or, as we noticed, maybe about 2,000 of you who wrote to us twice). After three days the total was more than 6,500. Not too bad.</p>

<p>Obviously, certain guys were favored by you, the users, although below we list three e-mails for each of the 10 players we chose (and one humorous e-mail). In a p0ll on the NBA page we received more than 65,000 votes (through mid day Wednesday) and no player was getting 20 percent of the vote, proving how wide open this debate is. The leader in the clubhouse was Allen Iverson, followed by Kobe Bryant, Chris Webber, Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, all getting between 11 percent and 20. Tim Duncan, surprisingly to us, was around 8 percent. Then came Vince Carter, and the bottom three of Gary Payton, Jason Kidd and Tracy McGrady were getting very little love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this very interesting to see, as if you ask NBA fans TODAY who the best players in the league were in 2001, the list will look very, very different. The advent of advanced stats, people forgetting the greatness of some players and looking at others with rose tinted goggles etc etc. I think it is a fun conversation to revisit</p>

As for Shaq being so low, he just wasn&rsquo;t as popular w/fans back then as the players who polled above him and that&rsquo;s really what this was, a popularity contest</p>

<p>NBA fandom&rsquo;s opinion of Shaq today is very different from what it was in real time during 2000-2004, everyone acknowledged his greatness and how good he was when he cared, the issue is that he didn&rsquo;t care very often and often was either hurt or out of shape.</p>

Also, Kobe was 2-3% above league average TS% those years so it’s hard to conclude that he was inefficient. Efficiency was lower that era because of the heavy defense/physicality due to the rules at the time. It was just much harder to score.</p>

<p>Of course you can. The goal of the game is to score more points. You don&rsquo;t get extra points for style or doing it from the perimeter vs at the rim.</p>

<p>But ya ppl do underrate Kobe&rsquo;s efficiency to build up Duncan or Shaq or whoever. Duncan was never <em>that</em> efficient either as he was pretty much tied with Kobe on way lower volume</p>

<p>this makes no sense, shot creation isn&rsquo;t equal. Derek Lively had a 68% field goal percentage and 73% TS across the entire playoffs. Thats elite. Does that mean the Mavs would have been better suited taking the ball out of Luka&rsquo;s hands to let Derek try and take 10 more shots? How is the defense going to adjust to that?</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t expect the main ballhandler and shot creator on the team to be a 60% TS player just like you don&rsquo;t expect the center who only takes lobs, dunks, and under the rim hand offs into open shots to not be above 60% TS.</p>

<p>The comparison doesn&rsquo;t even work at the same position. Luke Kennard has an equivalent career three point percentage to Steph Curry, but they aren&rsquo;t comparable because Kennard will only shoot wide open and Steph Curry shoots deep off the dribble shots. That they are even is a testament to how <em>good</em> Curry is.</p>

Back then, efficiency wasn&rsquo;t something they prioritized like they do today.  Shit, that Philly team that went to the finals this same year was basically setup so Iverson could get as many shots up (even very tough ones) as humanly possible and everybody else just rebounded and played defense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hard to expect fans to view the game the way it&rsquo;s viewed today when the players/teams themselves weren&rsquo;t even looking at it the way they do today.</p>

      <label for="lfizz6m" class="commentText"><p>I know this is kind of meme’d but one of the things Iverson did extremely well was drawing multiple defenders with his speed, which opened up the lane for his big to get an easy putback even if he missed.</p>

<p>That’s going to show up as a negative in the stat sheet but in reality helped his team a LOT.</p>

      <label for="lfjev8m" class="commentText"><p>There were no teams that year that won 60 games, but the question would be could a Bulls lineup of Jamal Crawford - Ron Mercer - Ron Artest - Elton Brand - Shaquille O’Neal have been good enough to contend with the 76ers and Bucks in the East in 2001? Shaq was dominant enough at that point that I think it’s a possibility they make the finals out of the East. Keep in mind that a rookie Shaq took the Magic from 21 to 41 wins several years earlier when he wasn’t nearly as dominant.</p>

<p>for instance, I feel that the East had only Boston as contenders. Could they lose to the healthy Sixers or even Knicks? Unlikely, but possible</p>

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t make those teams contenders. To me, contenders is &lsquo;at least a 35% chance to beat any team in the league, should never be heavy underdogs&rsquo;.</p>

<p>like, if you dropped Jokic on the Wizards, they could upset a team. but they&rsquo;re realistically getting smashed by the Celtics if they match up against them. I don&rsquo;t feel that any player ever put on the 2024 Pistons would give them a genuine chance against the 2024 Celtics</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to bet, you can <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/" target="_blank">look it up.</a></p>

<p>55% of American adults had internet access in 2001. And its heavily skewed by age - around 70% of adults 49 or younger had it, and only around 14% of those 65+ did.</p>

<p>But yes, broadband penetration was &amp;lt; 10%, and video sharing/streaming was extremely difficult pre-YouTube (2005).</p>

Shaq shooting free throws was amazing! They weren’t just bad but entertainingly bad. Giannis shooting free throws is so long and boring. But it means I have time to go to kitchen or bathroom more often.</p>

<p>Allan Iverson was probably the most popular player in terms of style and swag.  Every kid in the park wanted to imitate him.  He affected the game with his crossover and driving like Curry did with his shooting.  </p>

      <label for="lfiljqz" class="commentText"><p>Yep, it seems silly to look back at now, but LeBron didn&rsquo;t firmly take the title of best player in the world&hellip;until 2012. Kobe was <em>the guy</em> on the 08 Redeem Team and won back to back titles in 09 and 10. LeBron had won a couple MVPs, but his reputation was kinda trash. There was the LeBronze nickname from 04 and failing in the playoffs even after his MVPs had people calling him LeFraud. He was frequently criticized for passing to lesser players rather than taking the big shot, he quit against Boston, and then he had the disastrous finals against Dallas. It took an all-time peak season followed by a title to cement him as best in the league to people at the time.</p>

      <label for="lfioflf" class="commentText"><p>When lebron went to the heat, the overwhelming opinion was that &ldquo;The best player in the world joined the 2nd or 3rd best&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In 2008 and 2009 when Lebron won back to back MVP&rsquo;s and was carrying a trash team on on which he was firmly the best player. in the world and recognized as such. Only Laker stans thought kobe was number 1. You&rsquo;re being a little biased with your description, there. As a guy who wasn&rsquo;t a Cavs or a Lakers fan, it wasn&rsquo;t close at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: i&rsquo;ll rephrase this to say that when &ldquo;the Decision&rdquo; happened Lebron was unanimously the no.1 player. I don&rsquo;t know of anyone that said otherwise. If 2008 or 2009 didn&rsquo;t convince the kobe fans then they believed Kobe was the best until he retired.</p>

Kobe vs Lebron from 2007-2010 was basically our generations version of Magic vs Bird or now MJ vs Bron the kinda stuff that went <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> in school/barbershops and the like. If anything among neutral fans slightly more ppl still leaned Kobe since Lebron hadn’t won a championship yet.</p>

<p>But to your point there were ALOT of laker fans back then too.</p>

Once he got in the league it was Lebron vs Kobe and Lebron vs Jordan actively happening. Kobe was sort of the stand-in or &ldquo;current Jordan&rdquo; for some fans. Charles Barkley in 2007:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This guy Lebron James, is a bigger, stronger Michael Jordan. I never thought I would say that. If he can win 5 or 6 championships&hellip;it&rsquo;s an honor&hellip;you know I love Kobe Bryant he&rsquo;s one of the 10 greatest players ever, but this guy Lebron James., Michael Jordan was on a whole other planet compared to guys. This guy Lebron James is on another planet.</p>

<p>He played center in the second half of his career, but his first 13 seasons were all double-double&rsquo;s with 9 of 13 being 20-10 seasons.  Add the titles and the great defense&hellip; evaluated as a PF, he&rsquo;s got a strong argument as the best PF of all-time.</p>

I remember Kenny Smith going on and on about how much effort it took for Iverson to get so many shots off and that people should admire how hard he was working for his team to win instead of calling out the fg%. The argument worked when they were winning! But, it fell flat when he wasn&rsquo;t advancing in the playoffs most of his career.</p>

<p>Everyone is in here like only fans thought he was the best because of his “style and swag”, voting was “split” between Shaq and Kobe, these were just casual fans, etc. </p>

<p>What’s left out of this post is that players, fans,  media, analysts all thought he was the best. It wasn’t really contentious. He won 93 first place votes next to Tim Duncan’s 18 for MVP. Shaq wasn’t even second in voting because he didn’t have the dominance during regular season, partially due to injuries.  It wasn’t a controversial award like Westbrook or Embiid either, no one was talking about AI winning only on “narrative”. </p>

<p>During the regular season he was the best player in the NBA. He took the Soxers to the Finals where Shaq didn’t beat him, Shaq AND Kobe did. Mutombo might have been a DPOY but he wasn’t a two way threat or an MVP candidate like both Shaq and Kobe (who were All-Defensive 2nd team each).   </p>

<p>~10 years ago some guy online used advanced stats to argue that AI was the most overrated player in history. This type of “I know you thought X was true, but here’s how the opposite is true” is viral hot take gold and snowballed. That whole narrative evolved over the last decade in to this weird agreement among young fans that AI wasn’t even very good.   </p>

<p>But players and analysts from that era aren’t the ones saying that, it’s young online fans.   </p>

<p>Anyone who actually watched the NBA in 2001 knows that at 6’ he was without a doubt the best basketball player in the world for a brief period of time. It wasn’t for lack of competition either, Tim Duncan, Shaq, KG, and Kobe were playing prime ball. </p>

<p>I’m not saying he wasn’t a lazy defender or inefficient shooter, or that he didn’t eventually stop trying hard and become a poor leader. All that was true, but he was still clearly the best at the time and the concept that he didn’t deserve MVP now playing out 20 years later is not accurate.</p>

      <label for="lfjd205" class="commentText"><p>“I know you thought X was true, but this is how the opposite is true” sums up all basketball talk on Reddit and social media in general now. It’s just debate nerds who like arguing over the same ten topics more than they ever actually enjoyed basketball. It seems like almost every “fan” you see online today started “watching” basketball post-2015, regardless of their actual age. Then they retroactively go back and call every popular superstar overrated, and every superstar that didn’t have a big fan base underrated.</p>

<p>Kobe and A.I. are the two most beloved players, the ones they’ll call overrated (throw in T-Mac as well). Duncan, Dirk, KG, and Nash, the superstars who have way fewer core fans, are underrated. Not only will they call those players underrated, but they’ll also take it to the extreme and say the craziest things in the complete opposite direction. The same people will say Kobe doesn’t have a case for the top 5, but then will turn around and say Duncan has a GOAT argument, KG has a top 10 peak, and Nash is actually the third greatest PG of all time.</p>

<p>The sub is full of people who are dumb enough to think they’re smart but never smart enough to realize when they’re wrong.</p>

      <label for="lfjonyp" class="commentText"><p>If there was ever a year where AI would be in the top 5, &lsquo;01 would be the year.  Just reviewing the numbers that season, it&rsquo;s a pretty solid list. The biggest omission was probably Vince, who was on demon time in 2001.  But that was the season after losing McGrady and Toronto was still trying to figure out what to do.  Still took Philly to 7 games and lost by 1 point.  They could&rsquo;ve easily been the EC rep in the finals that season instead of Philly.</p>

<p>Funny how the narrative was that Shaq only tried in 2000 and fell off (for him) the follow regular season due to not caring until the playoffs, but his numbers were virtually identical.</p>

A lot of people thought KG was straight up better than him during their primes, and certainly very few people had him above Kobe. Now he’s being considered above Kobe and if you even compare him to KG people will laugh at you. I don’t know what caused such a sudden shift in his perception</p>

      <label for="lfjclds" class="commentText"><p>98% true. There are a few basketball media people pushing it, but no players ever say that unless they played for the Spurs. Nobody in real life says that shit either if we&rsquo;re being honest. Duncan was obviously great, but after age 26 or so, he was not taking over in big games. People say it&rsquo;s because his game wasn&rsquo;t flashy, but he wasn&rsquo;t dropping 40 on anyone. What are people supposed to think when Kobe went on to kill the league for another 7 seasons after Duncan slowed down his offensive output?</p>

      <label for="lfif6u2" class="commentText"><p>The shift is that advanced analytics love his game and people these days don’t care about aura or other BS like that. He was an ultra-efficient scorer who played DPOY-caliber defense, was a good playmaker, and won a bunch of titles. That’s the player you would create in a lab using modern analytics. Furthermore, people care less and less about in the moment popularity as time goes on.</p>

<p>It’s the same with players like Dave Stieb and Bert Blyleven in baseball. In the moment, they were considered good, but not great. However, looking at the stats shows they were legitmately some of the greatest pitchers ever and far, far better than their more popular(at the time) contemporaries.</p>
