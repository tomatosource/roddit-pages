      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef2x1k/in_2001_espn_asked_users_who_they_thought_the/"><p>In 2001, ESPN asked users who they thought the best player in the NBA was. They received 65,000 votes. The top 5 answers were: 1) Allen Iverson, 2) Kobe Bryant, 3) Chris Webber, 4) Kevin Garnett, 5) Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, 6) Tim Duncan</p>
</a>
    </h2>

      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240729154252/http://a.espncdn.com/nba/2001/0207/1067862.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We asked you to respond to our theme of who the best player in the NBA is, and, boy, did you respond. In the first 24 hours after we posted our Best Player Index page, a mere 4,000 wrote e-mails (or, as we noticed, maybe about 2,000 of you who wrote to us twice). After three days the total was more than 6,500. Not too bad.</p>

<p>Obviously, certain guys were favored by you, the users, although below we list three e-mails for each of the 10 players we chose (and one humorous e-mail). In a p0ll on the NBA page we received more than 65,000 votes (through mid day Wednesday) and no player was getting 20 percent of the vote, proving how wide open this debate is. The leader in the clubhouse was Allen Iverson, followed by Kobe Bryant, Chris Webber, Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, all getting between 11 percent and 20. Tim Duncan, surprisingly to us, was around 8 percent. Then came Vince Carter, and the bottom three of Gary Payton, Jason Kidd and Tracy McGrady were getting very little love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this very interesting to see, as if you ask NBA fans TODAY who the best players in the league were in 2001, the list will look very, very different. The advent of advanced stats, people forgetting the greatness of some players and looking at others with rose tinted goggles etc etc. I think it is a fun conversation to revisit</p>

As for Shaq being so low, he just wasn&rsquo;t as popular w/fans back then as the players who polled above him and that&rsquo;s really what this was, a popularity contest</p>

<p>NBA fandom&rsquo;s opinion of Shaq today is very different from what it was in real time during 2000-2004, everyone acknowledged his greatness and how good he was when he cared, the issue is that he didn&rsquo;t care very often and often was either hurt or out of shape.</p>

Also, Kobe was 2-3% above league average TS% those years so it’s hard to conclude that he was inefficient. Efficiency was lower that era because of the heavy defense/physicality due to the rules at the time. It was just much harder to score.</p>

<p>Of course you can. The goal of the game is to score more points. You don&rsquo;t get extra points for style or doing it from the perimeter vs at the rim.</p>

<p>But ya ppl do underrate Kobe&rsquo;s efficiency to build up Duncan or Shaq or whoever. Duncan was never <em>that</em> efficient either as he was pretty much tied with Kobe on way lower volume</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get extra points for style or doing it from the perimeter vs at the rim.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t have a team with 5 centers standing underneath the basket, though (ok, maybe back then you could have tried, but even then your 4th 7 footer is going to be so unskilled they may as well not be on the court). Once you have 1-2 big men to score efficiently in the post, the <em>marginal</em> value of more interior scoring goes down since they&rsquo;ll just get in each other&rsquo;s way and be easier to double-team. So it makes sense to compare guards to guards and centers to centers. Relatedly, a player who takes a lot of tough shots <em>on possessions that otherwise break down</em> might have a very high <em>marginal</em> value to the team, because the alternative on those possessions is a <em>really</em> low % shot, even if their overall efficiency doesn&rsquo;t look great.</p>

<p>Of course you can. The goal of the game is to score more points. You don&rsquo;t get extra points for style or doing it from the perimeter vs at the rim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this makes no sense, shot creation isn&rsquo;t equal. Derek Lively had a 68% field goal percentage and 73% TS across the entire playoffs. Thats elite. Does that mean the Mavs would have been better suited taking the ball out of Luka&rsquo;s hands to let Derek try and take 10 more shots? How is the defense going to adjust to that?</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t expect the main ballhandler and shot creator on the team to be a 60% TS player just like you don&rsquo;t expect the center who only takes lobs, dunks, and under the rim hand offs into open shots to not be above 60% TS.</p>

<p>The comparison doesn&rsquo;t even work at the same position. Luke Kennard has an equivalent career three point percentage to Steph Curry, but they aren&rsquo;t comparable because Kennard will only shoot wide open and Steph Curry shoots deep off the dribble shots. That they are even is a testament to how <em>good</em> Curry is.</p>

<p>The fact that he had a similar ts% to Duncan, who basically never shot outside of 15 ft tells us that Kobe was actually p good, especially for his era.</p>

Back then, efficiency wasn&rsquo;t something they prioritized like they do today.  Shit, that Philly team that went to the finals this same year was basically setup so Iverson could get as many shots up (even very tough ones) as humanly possible and everybody else just rebounded and played defense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hard to expect fans to view the game the way it&rsquo;s viewed today when the players/teams themselves weren&rsquo;t even looking at it the way they do today.</p>

He had the total opposite of a super star whistle. It was almost like the refs were told not to call every foul because he was either fouled or he was jamming it on 90% of the possessions.</p>

I HATED watching him play because it worked every time, he had the skills. How the fuck do you guard that!? lol
Shaq shooting free throws was amazing! They weren’t just bad but entertainingly bad. Giannis shooting free throws is so long and boring. But it means I have time to go to kitchen or bathroom more often.</p>

<p>Allan Iverson was probably the most popular player in terms of style and swag.  Every kid in the park wanted to imitate him.  He affected the game with his crossover and driving like Curry did with his shooting.  </p>

      <label for="lfiljqz" class="commentText"><p>Yep, it seems silly to look back at now, but LeBron didn&rsquo;t firmly take the title of best player in the world&hellip;until 2012. Kobe was <em>the guy</em> on the 08 Redeem Team and won back to back titles in 09 and 10. LeBron had won a couple MVPs, but his reputation was kinda trash. There was the LeBronze nickname from 04 and failing in the playoffs even after his MVPs had people calling him LeFraud. He was frequently criticized for passing to lesser players rather than taking the big shot, he quit against Boston, and then he had the disastrous finals against Dallas. It took an all-time peak season followed by a title to cement him as best in the league to people at the time.</p>

      <label for="lfioflf" class="commentText"><p>When lebron went to the heat, the overwhelming opinion was that &ldquo;The best player in the world joined the 2nd or 3rd best&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In 2008 and 2009 when Lebron won back to back MVP&rsquo;s and was carrying a trash team on on which he was firmly the best player. in the world and recognized as such. Only Laker stans thought kobe was number 1. You&rsquo;re being a little biased with your description, there. As a guy who wasn&rsquo;t a Cavs or a Lakers fan, it wasn&rsquo;t close at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: i&rsquo;ll rephrase this to say that when &ldquo;the Decision&rdquo; happened Lebron was unanimously the no.1 player. I don&rsquo;t know of anyone that said otherwise. If 2008 or 2009 didn&rsquo;t convince the kobe fans then they believed Kobe was the best until he retired.</p>

      <label for="lfj40bw" class="commentText"><p>Allen Iverson would not even be on the list judging by the way /r/nba talks about him today, even in these comments.   </p>

<p>Everyone is in here like only fans thought he was the best because of his “style and swag”, voting was “split” between Shaq and Kobe, these were just casual fans, etc. </p>

<p>What’s left out of this post is that players, fans,  media, analysts all thought he was the best. It wasn’t really contentious. He won 93 first place votes next to Tim Duncan’s 18 for MVP. Shaq wasn’t even second in voting because he didn’t have the dominance during regular season, partially due to injuries.  It wasn’t a controversial award like Westbrook or Embiid either, no one was talking about AI winning only on “narrative”. </p>

<p>During the regular season he was the best player in the NBA. He took the Soxers to the Finals where Shaq didn’t beat him, Shaq AND Kobe did. Mutombo might have been a DPOY but he wasn’t a two way threat or an MVP candidate like both Shaq and Kobe (who were All-Defensive 2nd team each).   </p>

<p>~10 years ago some guy online used advanced stats to argue that AI was the most overrated player in history. This type of “I know you thought X was true, but here’s how the opposite is true” is viral hot take gold and snowballed. That whole narrative evolved over the last decade in to this weird agreement among young fans that AI wasn’t even very good.   </p>

<p>But players and analysts from that era aren’t the ones saying that, it’s young online fans.   </p>

<p>Anyone who actually watched the NBA in 2001 knows that at 6’ he was without a doubt the best basketball player in the world for a brief period of time. It wasn’t for lack of competition either, Tim Duncan, Shaq, KG, and Kobe were playing prime ball. </p>

<p>I’m not saying he wasn’t a lazy defender or inefficient shooter, or that he didn’t eventually stop trying hard and become a poor leader. All that was true, but he was still clearly the best at the time and the concept that he didn’t deserve MVP now playing out 20 years later is not accurate.</p>

      <label for="lfi9p0c" class="commentText"><p>It is a fun convo and rehashing and the main thing is that analytics <em>did</em> exist then but it wasn&rsquo;t gospel. AI had a level of aura and devotion to his brand that was unrivaled. Kobe eventually matched that but not in 2001. And yes, of course PPG had a lot to do with it. We now look at the data beyond surface level numbers but the &ldquo;pure hooper&rdquo; days were a good time. AI was as pure hooper as it gets.</p>

      <label for="lfj8lgg" class="commentText"><p>They talked about his lower fg% too though. I remember Kenny Smith going on and on about how much effort it took for Iverson to get so many shots off and that people should admire how hard he was working for his team to win instead of calling out the fg%. The argument worked when they were winning! But, it fell flat when he wasn&rsquo;t advancing in the playoffs most of his career.</p>

<p>The only reason you&rsquo;d get different answers for those players from people today is that they&rsquo;d be including the broader view of those players&rsquo; careers, i.e. Tim Duncan winning four more championships or Kobe winning a couple without Shaq 9 years later.</p>

He was an ultra-efficient scorer who played DPOY-caliber defense, was a good playmaker, and won a bunch of titles. That’s the player you would create in a lab using modern analytics. Furthermore, people care less and less about in the moment popularity as time goes on.</p>

<p>It’s the same with players like Dave Stieb and Bert Blyleven in baseball. In the moment, they were considered good, but not great. However, looking at the stats shows they were legitmately some of the greatest pitchers ever and far, far better than their more popular(at the time) contemporaries.</p>

I used to think Shaq sucked and didn&rsquo;t have much skill in the sense that if I had Shaq&rsquo;s body I would be dunking on everyone as well. Iverson seemed like he was the best because he was capable of doing the most and he was small as well. Top scorers also used to shoot in like the low to mid 40s back in the day.</p>

<p>They were ranked 3-4, so it’s not like there was a huge disparity between the two. Considering the time/era, the counting stats meant a lot more at the time.</p>

<p>KG really started solidifying himself as the player we remember in the 01-2+ seasons.</p>
