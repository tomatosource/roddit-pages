      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef2x1k/in_2001_espn_asked_users_who_they_thought_the/"><p>In 2001, ESPN asked users who they thought the best player in the NBA was. They received 65,000 votes. The top 5 answers were: 1) Allen Iverson, 2) Kobe Bryant, 3) Chris Webber, 4) Kevin Garnett, 5) Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, 6) Tim Duncan</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240729154252/http://a.espncdn.com/nba/2001/0207/1067862.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We asked you to respond to our theme of who the best player in the NBA is, and, boy, did you respond. In the first 24 hours after we posted our Best Player Index page, a mere 4,000 wrote e-mails (or, as we noticed, maybe about 2,000 of you who wrote to us twice). After three days the total was more than 6,500. Not too bad.</p>

<p>Obviously, certain guys were favored by you, the users, although below we list three e-mails for each of the 10 players we chose (and one humorous e-mail). In a p0ll on the NBA page we received more than 65,000 votes (through mid day Wednesday) and no player was getting 20 percent of the vote, proving how wide open this debate is. The leader in the clubhouse was Allen Iverson, followed by Kobe Bryant, Chris Webber, Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, all getting between 11 percent and 20. Tim Duncan, surprisingly to us, was around 8 percent. Then came Vince Carter, and the bottom three of Gary Payton, Jason Kidd and Tracy McGrady were getting very little love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this very interesting to see, as if you ask NBA fans TODAY who the best players in the league were in 2001, the list will look very, very different. The advent of advanced stats, people forgetting the greatness of some players and looking at others with rose tinted goggles etc etc. I think it is a fun conversation to revisit</p>

As for Shaq being so low, he just wasn&rsquo;t as popular w/fans back then as the players who polled above him and that&rsquo;s really what this was, a popularity contest</p>

      <label for="lfikdsm" class="commentText"><p>I will defend this take a bit. Averaging over 23 FGA in the regular season is rare even in the early 2000&rsquo;s and 1990&rsquo;s. There was only 1 time where more than 2 people averaged more than this in a single season and this was the aforementioned 2000-01 season.  If you check on or over 22 FGA, you will see that 9 players achieved this in 00-01.</p>

<p>So while both takes on this are less than accurate, this level of utilization is something that still happens in NBA. That being said, 27 points on 23 shots in the regular season would never happen in today&rsquo;s NBA, but you will absolutely see this in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lfihd9f" class="commentText"><p>Efficiency is not a meaningful comparison there. Can’t compare center vs guard shooting efficiency when Shaq never shot long range. Also, Kobe was 2-3% above league average TS% those years so it’s hard to conclude that he was inefficient. Efficiency was lower that era because of the heavy defense/physicality due to the rules at the time. It was just much harder to score.</p>

<p>Of course you can. The goal of the game is to score more points. You don&rsquo;t get extra points for style or doing it from the perimeter vs at the rim.</p>

<p>But ya ppl do underrate Kobe&rsquo;s efficiency to build up Duncan or Shaq or whoever. Duncan was never <em>that</em> efficient either as he was pretty much tied with Kobe on way lower volume</p>

      <label for="lfiioor" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but that also shows you how the game was planned, played, and viewed by everybody back then vs today.  Back then, efficiency wasn&rsquo;t something they prioritized like they do today.  Shit, that Philly team that went to the finals this same year was basically setup so Iverson could get as many shots up (even very tough ones) as humanly possible and everybody else just rebounded and played defense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hard to expect fans to view the game the way it&rsquo;s viewed today when the players/teams themselves weren&rsquo;t even looking at it the way they do today.</p>

<p>It’s pretty ironic to talk about “how people viewed the game then vs now” and then have your argument be completely narrative based while ignoring the factual evidence that disproves the narrative</p>

<p>You’re doing the same thing, you’re just going off a narrative you’ve decided you like more</p>

<p>Allan Iverson was probably the most popular player in terms of style and swag.  Every kid in the park wanted to imitate him.  He affected the game with his crossover and driving like Curry did with his shooting.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not his exact quote, but his messaging was similar. It rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, even ESPN at the time (which wasn&rsquo;t controversial or shit-stirring) was scratching their head and called him out a bit too.</p>

      <label for="lfiljqz" class="commentText"><p>Yep, it seems silly to look back at now, but LeBron didn&rsquo;t firmly take the title of best player in the world&hellip;until 2012. Kobe was <em>the guy</em> on the 08 Redeem Team and won back to back titles in 09 and 10. LeBron had won a couple MVPs, but his reputation was kinda trash. There was the LeBronze nickname from 04 and failing in the playoffs even after his MVPs had people calling him LeFraud. He was frequently criticized for passing to lesser players rather than taking the big shot, he quit against Boston, and then he had the disastrous finals against Dallas. It took an all-time peak season followed by a title to cement him as best in the league to people at the time.</p>

      <label for="lfi9p0c" class="commentText"><p>It is a fun convo and rehashing and the main thing is that analytics <em>did</em> exist then but it wasn&rsquo;t gospel. AI had a level of aura and devotion to his brand that was unrivaled. Kobe eventually matched that but not in 2001. And yes, of course PPG had a lot to do with it. We now look at the data beyond surface level numbers but the &ldquo;pure hooper&rdquo; days were a good time. AI was as pure hooper as it gets.</p>

<p>The only reason you&rsquo;d get different answers for those players from people today is that they&rsquo;d be including the broader view of those players&rsquo; careers, i.e. Tim Duncan winning four more championships or Kobe winning a couple without Shaq 9 years later.</p>

      <label for="lfif6u2" class="commentText"><p>The shift is that advanced analytics love his game and people these days don’t care about aura or other BS like that. He was an ultra-efficient scorer who played DPOY-caliber defense, was a good playmaker, and won a bunch of titles. That’s the player you would create in a lab using modern analytics. Furthermore, people care less and less about in the moment popularity as time goes on.</p>

<p>It’s the same with players like Dave Stieb and Bert Blyleven in baseball. In the moment, they were considered good, but not great. However, looking at the stats shows they were legitmately some of the greatest pitchers ever and far, far better than their more popular(at the time) contemporaries.</p>

      <label for="lfik59v" class="commentText"><p>I’m a huge KG stan. The article was written in Feb 01. CWebb was considered the piece and had just finished a 27/11/4 year on a 55-win team. KG was coming off a 22/11/5 on a 47-win team.</p>

<p>They were ranked 3-4, so it’s not like there was a huge disparity between the two. Considering the time/era, the counting stats meant a lot more at the time.</p>

<p>KG really started solidifying himself as the player we remember in the 01-2+ seasons.</p>

      <label for="lfigm02" class="commentText"><p>IMO partly due to how they were marketed then.  Like Webber and KG are above Shaq and Duncan.  I recall those Kings teams were fun.  2001 was after White Chocolate, Webber, Peja and Divac were playing some exciting ball.  In 2001, they swapped Bibby in place for Williams and had the best record in the league.</p>
