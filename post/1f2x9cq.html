</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Self-explanatory topic on this post. The Milwaukee Bucks replaced Beverley, Crowder, Gallinari, Beasley, with Gary Trent Jr., Taurean Prince, Delon Wright. They&rsquo;ve significantly improved their depth around their stars. Giannis goes into the season healthy and rested. Middleton had surgery on both ankles during the offseason, which was described as clean up surgery for both, and he should be ready for camp, though they will surely take things slowly with Middleton. He has missed time and had some significant injuries in recent years but even with the surgeries should be going into this season the healthiest he has been in a while. Dame says he feels great and he should go into the season in much better shape than last year with all the drama that swirled around him.</p>

<p>The Knicks added OG Anunoby during the season last winter and added Mikal Bridges during the offseason, trading five first round picks and a swap for his services, but nobody meaningful from the current roster. Julius Randle is recovering well from his shoulder surgery and Mitchell Robinson is continuing to rehab his ankle after surgery to repair a stress fracture. Julius seems on track to start the season but Mitch may not. Knicks have the Nova connection and are a team with excellent chemistry and coaching. People seem to view them as a defensive team first, but they&rsquo;ve been a top 5 offense in the NBA the last two seasons with Brunson and Randle healthy, and now have added an elite third banana in Mikal.</p>

<p>They were the 6th and 7th ranked offenses respectively last season and there is a very fair argument to be made they both end up top 3 this year. Defensively, Bucks have Giannis/Brook who remain an elite pair. Knicks have OG/Mikal, which should be an elite wing pair. When Mitch is healthy, he&rsquo;s a positive on D, but much less so when not and they&rsquo;re thin behind him. Both teams have some potential vulnerabilities on defense.</p>

<p>Which team do you consider the bigger threat to Boston going into the season?</p>

      <label for="lk9p5dp" class="commentText"><p>I’d still go with the Bucks as of now. Giannis has been hurt the last two playoff runs but he was probably the best playoff performer in basketball from 2019-22 even with some chokes. They’re obviously a lot older than NYK but their starting 5 is a lot more talented and they still have a ton of championship experience. Also Thibs teams are incapable of staying healthy enough for a deep run</p>

      <label for="lka2415" class="commentText"><p>Giannis was not a better playoff performer than Steph, KD, Lebron, Kawhi over that stretch. They just all had a season with missed playoffs due to injuries.</p>

<p>Yes, Giannis is still the best player in the East, but the Knicks are just a better team. They can change games with offensive rebounding, have two elite versatile wing defenders, and an extremely strong second unit. At this point, Brunson has solidified himself as a certified playoff performer for them at the top as well.</p>

<p>Somehow the takeaway of Giannis being hurt multiple playoffs in a row is that the Knicks have the injury concerns.</p>

<p>DiVincenzo was literally one of the best 3 point shooters in basketball last year, and Hart was a monster on the boards and stepped up in his shooting. I don&rsquo;t see how you possibly watched what we did in the playoffs and the takeaway is that our guys can&rsquo;t be trusted&hellip;</p>

<p>He did&hellip; everybody was hurt.</p>

<p>OG played 14 games, got hurt 18, played 3, got hurt for 9, and then played 6. He was big in January but he was not a factor most of the season. And definitely not for the majority of the back half of the season.</p>

<p>DiVincenzo stepped up but the team was ass without Brunson.</p>

<p>Randle, OG and Mitchell all missed time, Hart was hurt and Brunson broke his hand.</p>

<p>So excuse almost your entire starting 5 was hurt in some way come playoff time.</p>

<p>Celtics are a much better team and the gap isn’t quite as large as Giannis being the MVP and Tatum being a 15 PPG 2nd option to Kyrie. They’re clearly a lot closer now even if Giannis is better.</p>

<p>I don’t think we can use the 2019 series as a data point for this matchup, and probably not 2022 either since both rosters are different.</p>

And what does the Celtics roster changes have to do with the bucks being more of a threat than the Knicks? Giannis has been hurt the past two playoffs so it’s been way too easy to forget that he is still a top 2 player in the league and any team that has him is always going to be a top contender</p>

And again, the Celtics roster changes have nothing to do with Knicks v Bucks, which is the entire point of this post. So, yes, “we are based in reality” but you really made a deep cut with that stinger so I hope that you gained a sufficient amount of cool edgy redditor points there to make you feel a little better about yourself</p>

<p>But I think both the 76ers and Bucks have a higher ceiling,  if healthy. Both teams would have the best player in a series against the Knicks, and very good number 2 and 3 options. But both need a lot of things to go right for them (health, form, fit) - and if it does then they look more like championship calibre rosters than the Knicks - I just wouldn&rsquo;t bet on those things all happening.</p>

<p>And that all really has more to do with how damn stacked Boston is than the two teams we’re actually talking about. The Celtics are ridiculously good top to bottom as long as Tingis Pingis comes back smoothly.</p>

<p>The Knicks are really good too of course and their floor is much higher than the Bucks, but I think Milwaukee has a higher ceiling with Dame and Giannis, although they’re not too likely to achieve it. </p>

<p>But I think that’s the ceiling you need to have if you really want to challenge the Celtics. </p>

      <label for="lk9ru8n" class="commentText"><p>Bucks starting 5 had the best defensive rating in the league last year. Their bench was horrific defensively but they actually got somewhat serviceable defenders in Prince and Wright.</p>

<p>Even then our defense was ranked like 13-14 from the time doc took over till the playoffs.</p>

<p>You haven’t even seen the defense for next season.</p>

      <label for="lk9rerz" class="commentText"><p>I definitely think it&rsquo;s possible the Bucks will put it all together and look better than expected. But realistically, we are quite old and increasingly injury prone. Whereas the Knicks are trending up, and now have Bridges and OG on the wings which will just be insane defensively. Hate to say it but I got Knicks.</p>

      <label for="lk9slv9" class="commentText"><p>Depends on health for both.</p>

<p>Bucks: they have Giannis who will no doubt give the Celtics a harder time than Brunson. If Giannis and Dames chemistry improved it would also be huge. Even last season as bad as it was we were 2-2 against the Celtics and the two times we won was by 25+. We lost by 3 at Boston with our full roster then lost by 3 again without Giannis.</p>

<p>Knicks: depends if Brunson can score efficiently or atleast more efficient than he was last playoffs. He scored 32 ppg but he took like 28 shots and 9 FTs. If Mitchell goes down then KP will feast.</p>

<p>But I think all of bucks, Knicks and Sixers will be a threat just depends on health.</p>

<p>Hasn&rsquo;t Brook clearly been a step slow and trending the wrong way? And is that not pretty clearly the direction of most of their team cause of their age?</p>

      <label for="lk9stie" class="commentText"><p>I think the Knicks are more likely to beat the Celtics next season based on health, chemistry, youth, and team defensive ability. It wouldn’t make sense for them to take a step backwards because of how young their core is and the pieces they acquired.</p>

<p>The Bucks are old asf, and only managed to offer momentary flashes of inspiring basketball last year. It’s possible they’re just in a decline and not going to get any better. It’s also possible last year was an adjustment period, and with Dame in his second year, a steady head coach and a healthier season to gel that the team improves.</p>

<p>Overall, If both teams hit their ceiling I think the Bucks would be better by a significant margin.</p>

<p>I don’t really think that’s gonna happen, but I do hope it does.</p>

<p>We have 0 answers for Celtics on defense other than pray the 3s aren&rsquo;t dropping. I think it would be a great series and go 7 games. Think the Cs beat the Knicks in 5 or 6 max with a few close games but mostly having control.</p>

The Bucks over performed their net rating based win loss record by 2 games. 3 of the 4 top members of their core, including two players who are significantly over the age of 30 played their most games in 5 years and they outperformed their net rating and they still had a worse record than a Knicks team who’s 2nd scoring option for half the season is currently coming off the bench. What is the argument for positive regression for the Bucks?</p>

<p>Knicks made a good run last season with a badly injured roster. I know, we expect some injuries again.</p>

<p>But, Mikal is a huge acquisition not just because of his elite skillset and the Nova connection, but because he is an iron man.</p>

<p>Not going to belittle the Bucks, I hope they’re a better team next season, but up until I see it, and know some of their aging guys can play at that tip top level, I just don’t lend too much credence to them.</p>

      <label for="lk9rfe5" class="commentText"><p>Bucks have the best player but Knicks play a style of basketball that matches up much better with the Celtics, and with a better overall roster with good depth.</p>

<p>Giannis is Giannis, but Bucks have never had an answer for Tatum and Brown. JT especially goes mongo on the Bucks. And Bucks defense is atrocious, and with Dame/Middleton getting older, it&rsquo;s not getting better.</p>

<p>Knicks match up way better defensively, and still have a very good offense.</p>

<p>If they met in a 7 game series right now, imo, Celtics beat Bucks in 5 and Knicks in a tough 6.</p>

<p>So, Knicks.</p>
