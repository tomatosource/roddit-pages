      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f2y73e/these_are_the_next_nba_hopefuls_that_are_related/"><p>These are the next NBA hopefuls that are related to current/former NBA players.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In no particular order (Presumed draft classes are in brackets next to each player):</p>

<p><strong>Dylan Harper</strong> (2025) - In today&rsquo;s way to make sure this post ages poorly, Harper is considered one of the top prospects for the upcoming 2025 draft; depending on who you ask he&rsquo;s either 2nd or 3rd though where he&rsquo;ll ultimately end up in mock drafts of the draft proper remains to be seen.  Of course, father Ron Harper famously played for the Bulls dynasty before, during and after their 2nd 3peat while his older brother, Ron Harper Jr., is a Raptors legend, having played for them on a two-way contract after going undrafted.  Dylan has distinguished himself from his roleplayer father with a notably smooth game and a 6&rsquo;10 wingspan to compliment his solid defensive instincts.</p>

<p><strong>Cameron Boozer and Cayden Boozer</strong> (2026) - For the second course of our &ldquo;potential to age poorly&rdquo; meal, we have son of the 2x All-Star Carlos Boozer.  Cam is the projected top pick of the distant 2026 draft and brother to another potential pick in the 2026 NBA Draft in Cayden Boozer.  That said, 2026 is still a presidential midterm away (in terms of overall time, not in actual elections) so who knows how the 2025 draft class pans out, let alone 2026.</p>

<p><strong>DJ Rodman</strong> (2025) - No, he is not the menace that Dennis was on and off the court (And it&rsquo;s unclear how DJ feels about North Korea) but DJ is in the final season of his college career so it&rsquo;s more likely than not that he&rsquo;ll declare for the 2025 NBA Draft.  Perhaps he&rsquo;ll be able to play alongside son of Dennis&rsquo; former teammate in Scottie Pippen Jr.?  Regardless of where he ultimately ends up, he&rsquo;ll be entering said draft as one of the oldest players in the class.</p>

<p><strong>Bryce James</strong> (2026) - If older brother Bronny getting a large amount of unwarranted attention is any indication, Bryce is going to have eyes on him solely due to being LeSon of LeBron James, though at 6&rsquo;6 he is considered the more intriguing of the two LesKids as a prospect.  Whether James will stick around for one more season to play with his other son or not is up in the air and after the media circus that was drafting Bronny/Rich Paul threatening teams with Bronny playing in Australia instead, who knows if he&rsquo;ll have the leeway to force teams to yet again let his son join him in Bryce&rsquo;s rookie season.</p>

<p><strong>Karter Knox</strong> (2025-26) - Brother of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2018-06-22-fortnite-nba-draft-kevin-knox.html" target="_blank">Fortnite enthusiast</a> and Knicks fan favorite Kevin Knox.  It&rsquo;s always hard to talk about Overtime Elite players given its structure and general talent level compared to the NCAA or overseas leagues but he did join the Razorbacks for the upcoming college season so it&rsquo;ll be easier to see whether or not he&rsquo;s more/less legit than his infamous brother.</p>

<p><strong>Kobe Johnson</strong> (2025) - Did you know that Jalen Johnson&rsquo;s brother is only younger by about a year?  He&rsquo;s been draft eligible for a while but after entering the portal in the 2024 NBA Draft, he returned to college basketball, albeit via UCLA instead of USC.  Kobe is a notably solid defender that hits the 3 and D parts of 3 and D wing on paper.</p>

<p><strong>Kiyan Anthony</strong> (2026-27) - Melo&rsquo;s retirement announcement a few months ago more or less ruled out him playing with Kiyan like LeBron will, and it&rsquo;s far too early to say whether Kiyan is a legitimate prospect given his age but they are someone to keep an eye on for the distant 2026 NBA Draft, if not, 2027.</p>

<p><strong>Oscar Wembanyama</strong> (2026-27) - Yes, he has a brother (and a sister in Ãˆve Wembanyama who&rsquo;s been playing professional basketball longer than both of them), no he isn&rsquo;t quite the anomaly that his brother is.  That said, he&rsquo;s only 17, new to the game and a literal champion (He won at U15) so it&rsquo;s not unreasonable for the 6&rsquo;5 prospect to be on the radar for reasons beyond &ldquo;Is brother of arguably the greatest prospect of all time&rdquo;.</p>
