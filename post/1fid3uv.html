</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Because I didn’t watch him, all I know is defense was his calling card given his nickname (The Glove). But he had to be way more than that, since he’s a top 75 player and he led his team to the Finals in 1996.</p>

<p>If you watched him play during the playoffs during the 90s, what was he especially good at on offense? And what gave him trouble offensively? Similarly, what kind of players gave him trouble defensively?</p>

<p>Are there any player comparisons you can think of?</p>

<p>But GP was just beastly, something like Jrue Holiday if Jrue was also an elite floor general and could properly lead his team in scoring.</p>

<p>So maybe not much like him, but it’s hard to find a modern comparison.</p>

      <label for="lnglorr" class="commentText"><p>Payton was one of the greatest offensive point guards also.  He had a 10+ year window in an era of low scoring where he averaged over 20 points per game.  In his prime he was considered the second best passing point guard behind Stockton.  Payton&rsquo;s long lob passes were absolutely great.  He had the fastest hands in the NBA which is why he had so many steals.  He was also super strong for his size which contributed to his great on-ball defense, and his speed helped his off-ball D.  George Karl found a loophole in the illegal zone rules at the time with his double trap defense.  It worked best with Payton&rsquo;s wingspan, and his ability to quickly rotate and close on the ball handler.</p>

<p>Stockton vs. Payton was one of the greatest matchups to watch.  Payton always went hard at Stockton because that&rsquo;s who he was trying to be better than.</p>

<p>Weaknesses; Payton had a great drive to his left with a layup finish.  However, if the big rotated fast enough Payton would get stuck down in the low post on the left leading to a disjointed possession because he was in too deep to kick it out much of the time.  Payton&rsquo;s midrange jumper was decent but the closer it got to the 3 point line the worse it got.  His 3 point percentage wasn&rsquo;t good.  He was a decent rebounder for a PG but not nearly as good as Kidd for example</p>
