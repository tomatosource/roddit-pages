<p>My wife had a friend/coworker whose young daughter choked to death in front of her and her mother. They tried to dislodge the grape and nothing worked. By the time an ambulance got there, the girl was brain dead. It&rsquo;s about the worst thing I can imagine as a parent.</p>

<p>We were cutting our kids&rsquo; grapes in half until they were 10 after that happening.</p>

He starts yelling, I smell gas! There&rsquo;s a gas leak! Started a panic and everyone started running outside. Campus police came, found out who started the panic and literally handcuffed my friend and put him in their car. About 30 minutes later they had to evacuate the dorm because there actually was a gas leak.</p>

      <label for="l6ho02p" class="commentText"><p>That‚Äôs awesome. I attended a wedding last month and the bride and groom‚Äôs ‚Äúmeet cute‚Äù also involved the groom being a drunken hero.</p>

<p>The bride and groom met in college. The groom was attending a party the bride&rsquo;s roommate was throwing. The bride went to bed early. One of the guys at the party got into her room and tried to force himself on her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our hero (the groom) was drunk off his ass and desperately searching for a bathroom to throw up in. What he found was the bride&rsquo;s bedroom, where he immediately proceeded to vomit all over the would-be rapist&rsquo;s back/head. He went to apologize but the asshole fled the scene. He tried to apologize to the girl (who had traces of his vomit on her bed/floor), but she promptly burst into tears, hugged him and thanked him profusely.</p>

<p>Our hero was confused.</p>

<p>But, three years later, they were getting married.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI told one of the mothers to call the ambulance. I was terrified,‚Äù he recalled.</p>

<p>I randomly discovered this fact in a reddit post titled, &ldquo;The new guy burned down our workshop.&rdquo; A carpenter I know confirmed that this is a real thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting into refinishing old furniture, so I&rsquo;m glad I learned this now. You&rsquo;d think it&rsquo;d be more common knowledge!</p>

      <label for="l6hgir0" class="commentText"><p>My wife started getting into wood staining for her crafts. When she went out to get the finishing oils, I told her to also pick up a proper means of disposing for this very reason.</p>

<p>When she asked the person assisting her at Home Depot if they had a recommendation for a container to use for disposal, he told her that was an old wives tale and then went on to explain that he had &ldquo;thousands of hours&rdquo; of experience staining and had never seen such a thing. Massively infuriating. Curious how much damage this one person&rsquo;s stupidity has caused.</p>

A few days before Christmas a college girl was excited when the doorbell rang. Was expecting a gift from family. She began to run down the wooden stars with socks on. Slipped and fell to the bottom of the stairs. The mailman could see her but the door was locked. Called  911 but was too late. A tragedy that will not be forgotten.</p>

      <label for="l6hjvud" class="commentText"><p>It can definitely be lethal. It&rsquo;s called injection injury if you want to look it up.</p>

<p>Simple water can cause a lot of damage, because the wound looks like a cut, but it&rsquo;s actually a bunch of puncture wounds caused by the droplets. Each puncture wound brought bacteria from the skin surface deep into the tissue, together with water and no air access. It&rsquo;s the perfect recipe for an infection. For hundreds of infections. And because the whole wound turns bad, gets inflamed and swells, blood flow is restricted and therefore antibiotics won&rsquo;t be very effective.</p>

<p>Such an infection can turn easily into amputation, and death. Your odds of avoiding that increase dramatically if you get treated immediately (meaning you stop everything right now and go get a doctor to look at it. Right now), before everything swells and bacteria get their party really going.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just water. Any other chemical (typically paint, or oil from hydraulic systems) will add local poisoning and increase the swelling.</p>

      <label for="l6h3zxo" class="commentText"><p>I work at an injury law firm. My first paralegal case was during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Cleaning lady mixed bleach with ammonia and got sick.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the thing: the stupid business‚Äôs worker had her wait inside for for ambulance. When it got there, she said she wanted to use the toilet before leaving.</p>

<p>She never came out. She died.</p>

<p>Was there a case?  Doesn‚Äôt a professional cleaning person know that golden rule?</p>

<p>All they had to do was leaving the building. Did they make her stay inside to sit?</p>

<p>All in all, no case. Why? The woman was near retirement with no future assets. Her life‚Äôs worth being a cleaning lady when she‚Äôs not collecting assistance.</p>

<p>What would we sue for?  On whose behalf?  Her daughter didn‚Äôt want to open an estate because the trouble would not amount to more than it was worth.</p>

<p>So sad. Never mix those two chemicals. Get outside and far away if you do. Don‚Äôt rely on help from ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù of nothing.</p>

      <label for="l6h6efa" class="commentText"><p>There are a few reasons you can‚Äôt give a baby water.</p>

<p>One of the less important reasons is that water fills up their tummies and then they don‚Äôt get as hungry. Babies need plenty of calories to grow and if they‚Äôre not hungry they don‚Äôt get the calories.</p>

<p>The more important reason is that babies have tiny kidneys, and they can become overwhelmed easily. When babies have too much water, it dilutes the sodium content in their bodies which can lead to seizures. Their tiny kidneys just can‚Äôt keep up with the extra fluids being taken in.</p>

<p>Typically you can start giving your baby a LITTLE water at about 6 months or when they start solids. But that‚Äôs still only a few ounces at a time.</p>

      <label for="l6hdx5n" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say that underplays the radio stations culpability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the disc jockeys were aware of the death of Matthew Carrington by water intoxication.[35] At one point, a nurse contacted the station and informed the DJs that the contest could be dangerous and potentially fatal.[36] The DJs responded by saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re aware of that&rdquo; and said that the contestants had signed releases and couldn&rsquo;t file a lawsuit.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2009, after a week of deliberations, the jury awarded the survivors of Jennifer Strange the sum of $16,577,118 in monetary damages. Entercom Sacramento LLC was found to be 100% at fault for Strange&rsquo;s death while Entercom Communications was found to be 0% at fault. The jury also found that Strange was 0% at fault (that is, there was no contributory negligence) for her own death.[50]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There had been an extremely high profile case of water intoxication death a year or two before. They knew about it, they ignored it, didn&rsquo;t warn contestents, and they killed someone over a wii.</p>

It&rsquo;s a wooden box about the size of a trash can and has a lid on top. You store potatoes in it. When I was 10 or so I was playing in the kitchen and I got curious about it. I was never especially interested because, like, it was a potato box. What do I wanna look at some potatoes for? But for whatever reason I got curious, opened the lid, and woke up on the floor some time later with my chest burning so badly that I could barely draw breath to cry for what felt like ages. I didn&rsquo;t find out why that happened exactly until I was an adult and saw a comment like this on reddit, but I was scared to even go NEAR that damn potato box for the rest of my childhood lol</p>

Video was a dramatization, autopsy images, and pictures of a real car accident where one unbelted person effectively killed everyone else in the car when the car slipped off the road and did a single roll, because of their body impacting others &amp; knocking loose objects in the car around. The examiner and investigators compared the injuries caused by the car accident vs the injuries caused by the unbelted person, and it was possible that by the time first responders arrived, some of the passengers would have had potential for survival. I don&rsquo;t remember the exact details and they were vague since it was made specifically for new drivers, but basically the injuries from the unbelted passenger were more time-sensitive than the other injuries.</p>

<p>I once had an electrician come out to fix a short in an outside outlet, I offered to run in really quick and shut off the power and he&rsquo;s like, no thanks I&rsquo;m fine. He starts taking it apart and doing the fix power fully on.  It&rsquo;s just house voltage, and everything worked out fine, but it made me really uneasy.  Similar thing happened with an exterminator, sprayed dust everywhere outside and didn&rsquo;t wear even a rudimentary facemask. I just don&rsquo;t get the mentality of not taking your own safety into account like these guys do sometimes.</p>

<p>If it only has one way in and out, especially if it is below ground, there is a very real possibility that there isn&rsquo;t enough oxygen in there to support life.</p>

<p>Even something as simple as rusting metal can remove the oxygen from the air and if there isn&rsquo;t airflow going through the space the oxygen-depleted air won&rsquo;t be replaced.  Other processes can remove oxygen or produce actively toxic gases.</p>

<p>This sort of thing often kills more than one person as the first person to find the victim goes in to rescue them and becomes the second victim.</p>

<p>Edit: And, as excellently pointed out by u/porncrank, if it&rsquo;s just lack of oxygen you won&rsquo;t notice - you&rsquo;ll just fall unconscious.  Too much carbon dioxide is noticed by your body, but lack of oxygen isn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="l6hi83m" class="commentText"><p>Just to add on this- I think an environment most people don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre going into a poorly ventilated venue/room leads to dangerous levels of carbon dioxide exposure.</p>

<p>I went down a rabbit hole when I was a concert promoter in college. When we breathe out, our exhaled air contains approximately 3.8% or 38,000 ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide. CDC reports 30-minute exposure at 50,000 ppm produces signs of intoxication, and a few minutes of exposure at 70,000 ppm and 100,000 ppm produces unconsciousness [Flury and Zernik 1931]. AIHA [1971] reported that 100,000 ppm is the atmospheric concentration immediately dangerous to life. In addition, Hunter [1975] noted that exposure to 100,000 ppm for only a few minutes can cause loss of consciousness.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre in a enclosed, poorly ventilated small space with no airflow, i.e DIY venues basement shows with 100+ people sucking the oxygen out of the room and then exhaling carbon dioxide its a recipe for disaster that very few people even realize they are experiencing.</p>

<p>Also, classrooms, court rooms and conferences experience this as well to a less dangerous level but still leads to drowsiness and lack of focus.</p>

<p>And for God&rsquo;s sake, if you see someone bleeding profusely and you can&rsquo;t get it to stop, reach for the tourniquet! But also don&rsquo;t take that tourniquet off unless you were a licensed medical practitioner. And write the time&hellip;. It&rsquo;s not super critical that you write the time, but allows the doctors to know how long the tourniquet&rsquo;s been on and if they&rsquo;re going to need special practices to filter the blood before they release the tourniquet.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/en-ca/home/special-subjects/occupational-and-environmental-medicine/high-pressure-injection-injuries" target="_blank">https://www.merckmanuals.com/en-ca/home/special-subjects/occupational-and-environmental-medicine/high-pressure-injection-injuries</a></p>

<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re wearing all your PPE, got your goggles, your gloves, etc. And you&rsquo;re working with high pressure liquids, I&rsquo;m not talking cutting steel with water jets, just something with high enough pressure that can pieces or puncture the skin. And bang, you get a little stab from a pressurized fluid source. Not even bleeding that much, if at all, sometimes it‚Äôs just a little sting, but you go to medical and get the assistance and after a day, your hand is sore but otherwise fine.</p>

<p>If you obtain one of these injuries and don&rsquo;t alert the medical staff, you typically lose the limb. It can be just as bad with water/steam as with chemicals.</p>

<p>This was a safety moment at my company due to a mechanic getting a pinprick while changing a line. While he went for medical help, he didnt tell them it was a high pressure wound. As such, he progressively lost three fingers on his hand because the substances were blasted into muscle tissues and cause necrosis, slowly.</p>

      <label for="l6h7n16" class="commentText"><p>Carbonated water.</p>

<p>If a safety device fails in the soda fountain, the carbonated water gets into the ice maker line. The copper in the ice line converts it into carbonic acid. Consuming that acid leads to anywhere from 40-100+ deaths per year just in America.</p>

<p>Preventing virtually all of those deaths is as easy as adding 10 minutes of training in our food safety training. Just teach people that if the ice is green or greenish blue, the backflow preventer has failed and you need to shut down the drinks.</p>

About 20 children die each year in California from this plant. As they roast marshmallows the sap inside the stick seeps out and into the food.</p>
