</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>They traded away a 30 year old for a 21 year old who averaged 17/8/6 as a 20 year old. Giddey has the much higher potential than an aging 3 and D guy. Sure Giddey had a down year but he was also the 4th option. He has a ton of room to grow and no where near his potential. The Bulls have the much higher upside/ceiling in this trade, there’s almost no way they were going to get draft picks. Surprised people thought they would. What’s your take?</p>

His points per 100 and assists per 100 declined too so it wasn&rsquo;t just about reduced playing time.  The third season is when a lot of young players are supposed to take a leap and he went backwards.</p>

<p>Not to mention, he&rsquo;ll be an RFA after the upcoming season.  The Bulls will only have one season to evaluate and make a long term decision.</p>

      <label for="l9jcg4g" class="commentText"><p>I mean if you look at the team around Giddey you can see that his drop in production didn&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum. Yes, his performance this season was hugely disappointing but also his role changed really significantly. He no longer could consistently get the ball in his hands because of the emergence of the players around him such as Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren. He went from the 2nd/3rd option the two years prior to the 4th/5th option a lot of the time when he was on the floor this year. If you look at his stats for the month of March when SGA and JDub both missed time and Giddey took on more primary ballhandling duties, his stats and percentages rose and were more along the lines of the previous season. Giddey is a player with some very clear flaws but a lot of times the criticisms made on him particularly in regards to this season miss a lot of context</p>

<p>People talk about drafting BPA and then “just figure it out later” with trades, but then they look at that same prospect in a vacuum.</p>

      <label for="l9k10fx" class="commentText"><p>This is one of the biggest problem with Giddey on our team that people overlook. The Thunder drafted him when we started tanking and he was a project player. He exceeded a bit of expectation in year 1 so people forget that he still needed a lot of time for his development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him we got way too good way too fast. SGA turned into an MVP candidate, JDub and Chet emerged as the better option. As a result he was put into the worst possible position development wise. It also didn&rsquo;t help that his skillset just didn&rsquo;t match with our 2 best players on SGA and JDub.</p>

      <label for="l9jehq8" class="commentText"><p>Ehhhh, like I definitely agree that his role didn’t help him at all, but let’s not act like he hasn’t had issues since he been in the league. My biggest problem with him is he hasn’t really made meaningful improvements really anywhere year over year.</p>

<p>Last year he shot 34% from 3. Which isn’t terrible in a vacuum, but we saw how those shots were absurdly wide open all season. This is coming off his second off season with one of the best shooting coaches in Chip Engelland. I remember us saying when we got Chip that if Chip can’t get Giddey to improve then no one can…well here we are. Giddey’s still young enough that you could see improvement, but I’m less optimistic than ever.</p>

<p>Add to that, he’s never been a great defender. He’s never been physical enough down low, and he’s never gonna have enough lateral quickness to defend well at the perimeter. He’s one of the least athletic 6’ 7” dudes I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>I was very excited about him coming off of last season, but not seeing improvements, especially in the shooting area makes me skeptical. Idk, he’s young enough and in a better role he could, and I expect him to, be better than this seasons iteration of him. I’m just skeptical whether he’ll ever put it together to reach his ceiling.</p>

What&rsquo;s most troubling is how it&rsquo;s hard to find bigs with his skillset but only time will tell.  Bulls need to dump hard and that includes Vucevic.  DeMar rocks but I don&rsquo;t think he wants to stick around for this.</p>

      <label for="l9jjyqr" class="commentText"><p>What evidence has there been that the current FO/ownership of the Bulls value picks?</p>

<p>Just because Reddit and nba writers on twitter love picks doesn’t mean every nba franchise does or should.</p>

<p>They clearly prioritized a young player with potential over picks. I think instead of everyone ranting about what picks they didn’t get, we should be discussing did another team have a better young player to offer the Bulls than Giddey.</p>

<p>Giddey is coming off a terrible year.</p>

<p>In all honesty though I think the trade is a win win. When Giddey was able to handle the rock more in 22-23 he put up 17/8/6 at 20 years old on a play in team.</p>

<p>Dude doesn’t have room to grow on okc and if the bulls go into rebuild mode Giddey has a good chance to improve his talents. At this point it’s up to the bulls to put the balls in place to roll and help him grow</p>

      <label for="l9j7bax" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think this trade is that bad for the Bulls but they probably could have gotten like some guy OKC won’t need in the next 1 to 2 years (say Dieng) on top of what they got if they were super persistent. I don’t think OKC would say no to that if they just had to throw in one more non rotation player that won’t help them any time soon. </p>

      <label for="l9j9rzs" class="commentText"><p>Yea I agree. I think they probably will try to go for a huge move with all those firsts and any prospects they don’t need like Dieng (who will still carry the worth of a late first rounder as of now). </p>

<p>You know what’s so interesting. They have the ability to make the KD trade. I’m not saying they will or the Suns will accept, but they have all the picks necessary for it to be fair if the Suns want to rebuild. </p>

      <label for="l9j80h7" class="commentText"><p>From my view, I think it more had to do with the reporting that Bulls turned down other trades that included picks for Caruso.</p>

<p>Now it all depends on people’s perspective of the value of picks vs taking Josh Giddey, but everyone has a view that Giddey’s value is, with all fairness, an all time low. I do believe this trade is good for the Bulls because Giddey isn’t as terrible of a player as everyone sees him as, it’s just that the gap between his on-ball primary ball handling game and his off-ball game is huge and we mostly saw the latter in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The Bulls probably just see a lot of value in Giddey’s upside as a main ball handler point guard.</p>

Most GMs in the league would prefer Giddey over an end of the rotation veteran plus one or two late 20’s first rounders. No other contenders had a 21 year old like Giddey to trade Chicago which is clearly what they wanted.</p>

<p>They made the asking price so unreasonably high that they turned down some great offers for him.</p>

<p>Just to turn it all around and trade him straight up for Giddey. The bulls work in mysterious ways (also correct me if my memory is wrong)</p>

      <label for="l9j9v4y" class="commentText"><p>I think a lot of people in here are overlooking the part where OKC were trying to play Giddey as an off ball shooter. Giddeys been a PG his whole life, he’s never played anywhere else before. He also had a stretch as the PG this year when SGA was injured where he went 17/8/7 on <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>38</sub> splits I think he also dropped 2 triple doubles in that stretch iirc. I think the kids a good player he was just stuck in that spot where an MVP candidate plays your best position. He’s not the first to have that happen to him. In saying all that the Bulls could have at least got 1 of OKCs least valuable 1sts.</p>

      <label for="l9k6hzf" class="commentText"><p>Traded away a much better player for a pedo and didnt even get a second pick out of it. Giddey only played well offensively since teams would choose to leave him open. His numbers and efficiency will tank like Pooles after the trade to the wizzards. Alot of people seem to get this confused, a player averaging good numbers behind multiple different better offensive options doesn’t always mean that player is talented offensively. Just means he can hit the shots the defense is willing to sacrifice to guard the actual scoring threats.</p>

<p>Maybe the best offer from other contenders is off the table.</p>

<p>I’d criticize them more not on this actual trade but the fact that they decided to attempt to be a play in team instead of knowing it was time to flip players when they had the most value</p>
