      <p>07-08 New Orleans Hornets: 56 wins</p>

<p>Chris Paul played 80 games this season and averaged 21.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.0/11.6 to go along with 2.7 steals/game. Chris Paul had a strong argument for MVP that year but was edged out by Kobe who had all the career accolades but no MVP up to that point.</p>

<p>The next winningest seasons for the Pelicans were 23-24 and 08-09 tied at 49 wins.</p>

<hr>

<p>13-14 Los Angeles Clippers: 57 wins</p>

<p>This was the height of the Lob City Clippers. Chris Paul and co. were the last WC team to defeat the GSW in the playoffs before their generational dynasty. I remember this playoff series going to 7 games and being a very fun watch. The next year, the Clippers had to play the defending champ Spurs in the first round where Chris Paul made the game winner in Game 7 with 1 second remaining on a bum hamstring over Tim Duncan and Danny Green. Probably my favorite play of all time.</p>

<p>The next winningest seasons for the Clippers were 14-15 and 12-13 with 56 wins each.</p>

<hr>

<p>2017-18 Houston Rockets: 65 wins</p>

<p>The greatest threat to the KD Warriors. While most teams blew it up to try and rebuild, Daryl Morey and his Rockets were one of the few teams willing to compete against them. Chris Paul, notorious for his elite mid-range game, adapted to MoreyBall along with Harden and Capela to go up 3-2 against the greatest basketball team ever assembled.</p>

<p>Chris Paul goes down with a hamstring injury at the end of game 5 and the rest is history. Chris Paul at times looked like the best player on a court he shared with prime Steph Curry, Harden, Luc Mbah a Moute, KD, Klay, and Draymond. Those first five games are some of the highest skilled basketball that&rsquo;s ever been played imo. Missing 27 straight 3s (with a little sprinkle of Scott Foster in game 7) was some of the lowest skilled basketball that&rsquo;s ever been played.</p>

<p>The next winningest season from the Rockets was 93-94 with 58 wins.</p>

<p>21-22 Phoenix Suns: 64 wins</p>

<p>Magical season. Chris Paul was a veteran starting point guard on a team of mostly younger players (and superstar Devin Booker) who consistently closed out 4th quarters all year. Between this season and the OKC season, he built a reputation of being clutch in late game scenarios (something that plagued him early in his career). In game 6 against the Pelicans, he dropped 33 pts with 8 assists on a perfect <sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> from the field to send his former team packing. He turned 37 about a week later and the Suns lost to the Mavs in an infamous series.</p>

<p>The next winningest seasons from the Suns were 04-05 and 92-93 with 62 wins.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/suns-best-regular-season-record" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/suns-best-regular-season-record</a></p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>TL;DR
Chris Paul is 6&rsquo; tall and is entering his 20th season in the NBA. He has 11 All-NBA seasons and 9 All-Defense teams. He&rsquo;s pretty good at basketball. I&rsquo;m not sure anyone else has been a star player leading as many teams to their winningest seasons.</p>

<p>The only teams that Chris Paul has not led to their winningest seasons are the ones he spent only one season with (OKC, GSW).</p>

<p>San Antonio?</p>

<p>Edit: &ldquo;lead&rdquo; is a bit of hyperbole given how talented that Rockets team and that Suns team were. It&rsquo;s still impressive to be the PG and run some of the best offenses of all time that late in his career</p>

      <label for="lifmfat" class="commentText"><p>In 2019-2020 it was, the pacers were a very well rounded team with</p>

<p>The preseason rankings of the top 100 players in the nba had oladipo, Turner ahead of Sabonis and some had brogdon ahead of Sabonis also. Obviously in season he was their best player (only all star) but the pacers were 8-3 without Sabonis (and got swept by Miami without Sabonis) but they were def a legit team. Without Sabonis im guessing they would still have been the 6 seed in the East (my guess is like 37-36 on the season)</p>

<p>Which I think is still a pretty respectable win especially cuz they won by 15</p>

<p>I think beating the clippers (49-23) and mavs (43-32) by 2 is about the same as beating the Sabonisless pacers by 15</p>

      <label for="lifrxnw" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think they were a decent middle of the pack team without him. Their net rating without Sabonis was +0.6 which puts them around a .500 team.

      <label for="liasomr" class="commentText"><p>I agree that to some extent that is true</p>

<p>But also look at the rockets from 1/22/2021-2/4/2021 7-1 (10-54 the rest of the season), or the rockets 11/24/2021-12/08/2021 7-0 (13-62 the rest of the season), or the rockets 3/08/2024-3/29/2024  11-0 (31-41 the rest of the season)</p>

<p>Sometimes teams just go on winning streaks even if they are not very good, I’m not saying that this is definitely what happened with the suns but the same team was 27-39 pre bubble I think it’s prob a mix of both</p>

      <label for="lib1ndj" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but let’s not act like I pulled a random sample of 8 games out of a whole season, the league shut down for longer than a regular off-season, then only invited teams that could still make the playoffs</p>

<p>So everyone was healthy across pretty much every team and every team they played against was playoff caliber and they were playing better basketball</p>

<p>Not saying CP3 didn’t make them a lot better and they didn’t need his leadership, but it’s not like he joined a bottom feeder and turned them around</p>

      <label for="lib4lgi" class="commentText"><p>I didn’t pull a random sample of 8 games either to be fair, it was examples of how big winning streaks happen in basketball even for bad teams.</p>

<p>You did the same thing, yours was just 1 step more detailed, instead of picking a win streak you picked a win streak in a more quantized period of time.</p>

<p>And everyone may have been healthy but like nobody was playing</p>

<p>Mavs with Luka played 13 minutes in their game and no porzingas (2 leading scorers)</p>

<p>76ers without Embiid Harris Simmons and Horford and Richardson (5 leading scorers)</p>

<p>Thunder without Shai, Schroeder and Gallo (3 leading scorers) and Steven Adams</p>

<p>Heat without jimmy butler (leading scorer) and goran Dragic (starting pg in the bubble), or Kendrick nun (who was 3rd in minutes and scoring that season)</p>

<p>Pacers without Sabonis (2nd scorer)</p>

<p>Clippers and mavericks (by 2)</p>

<p>Wizards (without Beal, Bertans and ish smith, their 3 leading scorers, and they were a 24-41 team who cares)</p>

<p>So 5 wins wins came against a team that didn’t play <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of their top 5 players* (*mavs played <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of their top 5 players but none played more than like 20 minutes that game, Luka played 13)</p>

<p>2 wins were 100% them beating good fully healthy teams (they did win both those games by only 2)</p>

<p>And 1 of those wins the pacers were missing Sabonis, but I think that’s still a very quality win</p>

<p>I’m not saying they didn’t play well, and they can only play the teams in front of them. but it’s not like they were playing elevated competition. The suns 8-0 bubble run while impressive, imo it doesn’t show they were ready for a run as much as many people claim</p>

MDA made the call to put The Prince as smallball Center and we rallied to the win. Loved how he played for us. Him fucking up his shoulder definitely made our margin for error against GS that much thinner. He was supposed to be backup to Ariza, instead Trevor had to play basically 48 mins every game in that series guarding prime KD 1 on 1 (we didn&rsquo;t want to double on him leaving Steph and Klay with open looks) and had no legs to shoot 3s by game 7 (0-10 from deep).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Imagine CP3 with that lakers roster holy shit. CP3, the better on ball playmaker and more efficient scorer while being a better defensive guard. The Kobe revisionism is always so funny to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but kobe literally won the MVP by beating CP3&rsquo;s team to get the best record in the west</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An MVP he never deserved. Kobe was never the best player in the league let alone the MVP. KG and CP3, hell even Lebron were all better in 2008.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>also CP3 hornets lost to the spurs as the higher seed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we all know that seeding is always the best determinate of who the better team is.</p>

      <label for="liaqsn0" class="commentText"><p>I think as a teammate his edge has likely been reinforcing good habits, consistency and accountability. That disciplinarian structure works really well in the regular season when it comes to taking games off opponents who don’t have that same level of sustained focus (eg. back to backs, underdog games, away games in tough arenas)…</p>

<p>In the playoff setting though against other super stars and when players start to lock in, that edge dulls. And as a player he’s very rarely outshined his counter parts on the floor - and arguably the victim of making mental errors himself (ie. 4th quarter turnovers with the Clippers) in these pivotal playoff games (games 5, 6 and 7, etc)</p>

<p>In the words of Draymond Green: some guys are 82 game players, and some are 16. CP3 is the former IMO. He might genuinely be one of the best floor-raisers in history along w/ Westbrook in his prime. But neither are ceiling guys, which is what you want in the playoffs</p>

<p>Also: the season he was on OKC and completely destroyed the over-under w a team of young upstarts. I know that doesn’t fit the criteria of most winningest season but that was a remarkable job of raising the floor. Arguably more impressive than some of the seasons OP listed - listen to this:</p>

<p>2018-19: 49W team. This was when OKC went all in to try to win: PG13, RW and Jerami Grant.</p>

<p>2019-20: 44W team (-5). Clear tank/rebuild year going into the season. All 3 players mentioned above gone during the summer. Finished 5th in regular season in the west; CP3 magic.</p>

<p>2020-21: 22W team (-22). No CP3.</p>

<p>That is insane. Legit GOAT stuff. For instance, if you put 35 y/o Lebron on the Pistons, do you think LeBron could add beyond 25 wins just by himself?</p>

      <label for="lib2hmk" class="commentText"><p>Chris Paul made the rockets good because he could command the bench unit. In his minutes next to harden he was essentially a role player. Mike Dan toe knee learned pretty quick that it was best to stagger their minutes to always get elite guard play. The rest of that team was just role players that could defend and make open shots that cp3 and harden created for them. Eric Gordon could create a shot for himself. Almost no one else on the team could. And no one but Chris and harden could create a shot for others. So when CP3 went down in game 5, you can double harden to get the ball out of his hands and no one else on the team could make the right pass or create in time before the defense shifts back, leading to a neutered offense. That combined with losing luc mbah amoute &amp; coach Dan toe knee’s famously short rotations left our team gassed in the final games of playoffs series that went 6-7 games.</p>

      <label for="lihk63u" class="commentText"><p>Honestly there is something to be said for Chris Paul and his ability to be a floor raiser.  Developed more respect for him over the years.</p>

<p>As a Dubs fan, I was always a big Chris Paul hater due to him being on the Lob City Clippers and the mid 10&rsquo;s Rockets teams that pushed the Dubs the hardest.  I believed the worst about him from his cheap tactics, foul baiting, and general complaining about everything on the court.  I really started to change my mind about him when he went to OKC in the Russ trade.  I figured he&rsquo;d bitch and moan and force his way off that team.  But he stuck around and lifted that OKC team to a surprise playoff push.  Then he got sent to Phoenix and elevated that team also as you pointed out.</p>

<p>When he got sent to the Dubs last season, I was cautiously optimistic that this would be a sneaky good move.  Until he got hurt, it actually was a good move!  He brought a lot of stability to the bench unit, took that role graciously, stepped up to the starting lineup when needed, and was a net positive.</p>

<p>Should be interesting to see what Wemby can do with the Point God.</p>

<p>Imagine an efficient Trae Young. That would be Nash.</p>

<p>So we’re talking a dude who would put up <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on 50/40/90 efficient shooting in the modern day.</p>

<p>It’s not a stretch to say he could’ve been a worse scoring version of Steph, but with miles better playmaking.</p>

<p>Playoffs</p>

<p>CP3:  149 playoff games,  20/5/8 on .537 efg</p>

<p>Nash:  120  playoff games, 17/4/9 on . 529 efg</p>

<p>Throw in defense and its easy to pick Paul.  Maybe thats why Paul has 30 more playoff games to begin with!</p>

<p>The greatest threat to the KD Warriors.</p>

<p>The Rockets was NEVER a &ldquo;threat&rdquo; to the KD-Warriors.   Not a single Rockets player looked like a threat in the Playoffs, especially against GSW.  Harden is a renowned Playoff choker and CP3 is too small.   Rockets also had no defensive presence</p>

<p>Daryl Morey&rsquo;s Rockets also played some of the WORST basketball in Playoff history.     Just tried to shoot 3s</p>
