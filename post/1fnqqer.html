      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnqqer/with_todays_announcement_vince_carter_officially/"><p>With today&rsquo;s announcement, Vince Carter officially has more franchises retiring his jersey than playoff series wins as a Toronto Raptor</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Let&rsquo;s go over the Raptors success under Vince Carter:</p>

<p><sup>1998</sup>&frasl;<sub>99</sub> - Missed the playoffs; Vince wins RotY</p>

<p><sup>99</sup>&frasl;<sub>00</sub> - Made the playoffs, lost to the Knicks in a sweep</p>

<p>00/01 - Made the playoffs, won vs the Knicks in 5, lost to the 76ers in a controversial Game 7</p>

<p>01/02 - Vince was injured and the team made the postseason without him via an unexpected turnaround; they lost in 5 to the Pistons</p>

<p>02/03 - Missed the playoffs; Vince suggested that the recently drafted Bosh should be traded</p>

<p>03/04 - Missed the playoffs</p>

<p>04/05 - Vince did not finish the season as a Raptor to see them miss the playoffs, as he was traded in December (Among other events, he assaulted his coach during the leadup to the Nets trade)</p>

<p>None of Vince&rsquo;s seasons with Toronto managed to crack 50 wins in one of the weakest eras for the Eastern Conference.</p>

<p>When he came back to Toronto as a Mav, he got the video montage and crowd ovation and the tears and everything.  I really don&rsquo;t think the average casual or suit that can afford to go to a Raptors game these days care about Vince or remember anything about how Vince left.</p>

<p>Booing a veteran player who gave a lot to this team, and to the game, is more of a sign of a typical boorish unsophisticated Toronto sports fan. Who probably doesn&rsquo;t have much going on in their lives if hate for Vince still has a place in their mind.</p>

      <label for="lok9b4e" class="commentText"><p>As you must know the Raps were an expansion team and before Vince arrived, they went 21-61, 30-52, and 16-66 the very season before.</p>

<p>When he arrived they went a much better 23-27 in the lockout shortened season, then won 45, 42, and 47 games making the playoffs three years consecutively. It’s true that he got injured in 01-02 after a lengthy losing streak and the team rebounded without him, but he still played 60 games that year. And it wasn’t a very good team.</p>

<p>At some point it becomes a bit sour grapes, yeah? I know people hate how Vince left but let’s not start the historical revisionism now. Simply ask yourself, if Vince had left the team without pissing off an entire country and everything else had stayed the same, including his stats and success with the team, would you still be saying this?</p>

<p>Because if it’s just about the way he left, all of this doesn’t really matter, does it?</p>

      <label for="lokdnvz" class="commentText"><p>Jersey retirements are kind of just as much a personal thing as they are about paying tribute to the accomplishments while in that jersey. It&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;You mean something to this franchise.&rdquo; Given Vince has one of the all time ugly departures I think how the fans feel about retiring his number does matter, whether or not Vince (who in his Raptors jersey was undoubtedly an iconic player of his era) actually deserves it for merit.</p>

      <label for="loke0j1" class="commentText"><p>As someone who was a young teenager when he left and not from Toronto but from Canada and a Raptors fan my whole life, holding a grudge for 20 years with a man who left your team under less than ideal circumstances when he was in his 20s is silly.</p>

<p>Yes he was childish and immature but he was also immature because he was young and with a team that wasn&rsquo;t doing a great job keeping and building talent around him during his peak as an athlete which isn&rsquo;t a huge window for most athletes.</p>

<p>It also ignores how much he did to grow the game of basketball in Canada during his time for the Raptors. He got a lot of young Canadians interested in the game and that imo far outweighs him acting like a child during the last of his time here and forcing his way out. And if you can&rsquo;t forgive a man who acted like an ass 20 years ago you are likely more immature than he was at 27.</p>

      <label for="lokd5m6" class="commentText"><p>The Nets should not retire VC&rsquo;s jersey either. It&rsquo;s disrespectful to the other retired jerseys who made more of an impact, were more successful, and/or had longer tenures.</p>

<p>Julius Erving, John Williamson, and Bill Melchionni were major contributors to the Nets&rsquo; 2 ABA titles (and Williamson and Melchionni played for a while for the team, while Dr. J won 3 straight MVPs in his 3 year tenure).</p>

<p>Buck Williams carried the Nets through the 80s with playoff appearances and being a great defender and rebounder.</p>

<p>Jason Kidd played for 7 seasons and led us to 2 straight NBA finals, along with coming in 2nd in MVP voting and just reinvigorating the franchise and being an iconic passer and defender (also a wife-beater).</p>

<p>Drazen Petrovic was one of the greatest European players ever (scoring over 100 points in a game) and is iconic to an entire continent. He died tragically before reaching his potential with the Nets, though he was an elite 3-PT shooter.</p>

<p>Vince Carter didn&rsquo;t really DO anything except have a couple of iconic dunks. If he had played for maybe 3-4 more seasons with the franchise, then I would wholeheartedly say to retire his number just based on how iconic he was.</p>

<p>Then again, the Nets have Biggie Smalls&rsquo; &ldquo;number&rdquo; up in the Barclays Center&hellip;</p>
