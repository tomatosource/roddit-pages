      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnqqer/with_todays_announcement_vince_carter_officially/"><p>With today&rsquo;s announcement, Vince Carter officially has more franchises retiring his jersey than playoff series wins as a Toronto Raptor</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Let&rsquo;s go over the Raptors success under Vince Carter:</p>

<p><sup>1998</sup>&frasl;<sub>99</sub> - Missed the playoffs; Vince wins RotY</p>

<p><sup>99</sup>&frasl;<sub>00</sub> - Made the playoffs, lost to the Knicks in a sweep</p>

<p>00/01 - Made the playoffs, won vs the Knicks in 5, lost to the 76ers in a controversial Game 7</p>

<p>01/02 - Vince was injured and the team made the postseason without him via an unexpected turnaround; they lost in 5 to the Pistons</p>

<p>02/03 - Missed the playoffs; Vince suggested that the recently drafted Bosh should be traded</p>

<p>03/04 - Missed the playoffs</p>

<p>04/05 - Vince did not finish the season as a Raptor to see them miss the playoffs, as he was traded in December (Among other events, he assaulted his coach during the leadup to the Nets trade)</p>

<p>None of Vince&rsquo;s seasons with Toronto managed to crack 50 wins in one of the weakest eras for the Eastern Conference.</p>

<p>When he came back to Toronto as a Mav, he got the video montage and crowd ovation and the tears and everything.  I really don&rsquo;t think the average casual or suit that can afford to go to a Raptors game these days care about Vince or remember anything about how Vince left.</p>

<p>Booing a veteran player who gave a lot to this team, and to the game, is more of a sign of a typical boorish unsophisticated Toronto sports fan. Who probably doesn&rsquo;t have much going on in their lives if hate for Vince still has a place in their mind.</p>

      <label for="lokd5m6" class="commentText"><p>The Nets should not retire VC&rsquo;s jersey either. It&rsquo;s disrespectful to the other retired jerseys who made more of an impact, were more successful, and/or had longer tenures.</p>

<p>Julius Erving, John Williamson, and Bill Melchionni were major contributors to the Nets&rsquo; 2 ABA titles (and Williamson and Melchionni played for a while for the team, while Dr. J won 3 straight MVPs in his 3 year tenure).</p>

<p>Buck Williams carried the Nets through the 80s with playoff appearances and being a great defender and rebounder.</p>

<p>Jason Kidd played for 7 seasons and led us to 2 straight NBA finals, along with coming in 2nd in MVP voting and just reinvigorating the franchise and being an iconic passer and defender (also a wife-beater).</p>

<p>Drazen Petrovic was one of the greatest European players ever (scoring over 100 points in a game) and is iconic to an entire continent. He died tragically before reaching his potential with the Nets, though he was an elite 3-PT shooter.</p>

<p>Vince Carter didn&rsquo;t really DO anything except have a couple of iconic dunks. If he had played for maybe 3-4 more seasons with the franchise, then I would wholeheartedly say to retire his number just based on how iconic he was.</p>

<p>Then again, the Nets have Biggie Smalls&rsquo; &ldquo;number&rdquo; up in the Barclays Center&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lokykbr" class="commentText"><p>nothing to add except Petrovic&rsquo;s 100 points game wasn&rsquo;t against a real team. the team they had to play that day made a mistake when registering their squad so per the rules none of their real players could suit up so instead they had to play their youth squad (because youth players don&rsquo;t need to be registered to play) and drazen saw the opportunity to do something real funny, he ended with 112 points.</p>

      <label for="lol9t0n" class="commentText"><p>Oh I can understand the Raptors retiring VC much more than I can understand the Nets doing so. More seasons, better numbers, multiple All-NBA teams.</p>

<p>It’s just that Carter left on much worse terms. Frankly, he had one of the worst forced trades ever, since he purposely cut his performance.</p>

<p>Not every player needs their number retired anyway. I was trying to justify the Nets retired jerseys and I am not mad at any of them, but if it were up to me, it would just be Dr. J and Jason Kidd with their jerseys in the rafters. For Toronto, it may just be Lowry who truly deserves it.</p>

      <label for="lok9b4e" class="commentText"><p>As you must know the Raps were an expansion team and before Vince arrived, they went 21-61, 30-52, and 16-66 the very season before.</p>

<p>When he arrived they went a much better 23-27 in the lockout shortened season, then won 45, 42, and 47 games making the playoffs three years consecutively. It’s true that he got injured in 01-02 after a lengthy losing streak and the team rebounded without him, but he still played 60 games that year. And it wasn’t a very good team.</p>

<p>At some point it becomes a bit sour grapes, yeah? I know people hate how Vince left but let’s not start the historical revisionism now. Simply ask yourself, if Vince had left the team without pissing off an entire country and everything else had stayed the same, including his stats and success with the team, would you still be saying this?</p>

<p>Because if it’s just about the way he left, all of this doesn’t really matter, does it?</p>

It&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;You mean something to this franchise.&rdquo; Given Vince has one of the all time ugly departures I think how the fans feel about retiring his number does matter, whether or not Vince (who in his Raptors jersey was undoubtedly an iconic player of his era) actually deserves it for merit.</p>

      <label for="lokgwsw" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely, but then there’s no point in mocking him for perceived lack of team success. It wasn’t a good team and it was a newborn franchise.</p>

<p>And it’s enough to say that the way Vince left is enough to tarnish him for you forever. I know it’s personal, that’s the point.</p>

<p>It just seems people are trying to go from a very genuine “this guy sabotaged our team and left in a miserable way so fuck him” to starting to nitpick his impact on an expansion franchise that only existed for a couple years before he even showed up.</p>

<p>It’s just not necessary. Say that he doesn’t deserve to have his jersey retired because he wanted to be a deliberate albatross till they let him go, yes. That’s damning enough isn’t it, without having to pretend his initial impact wasn’t enormous?</p>

      <label for="lokn4pn" class="commentText"><p>I think pointing out the lack of success is kind of the point. It&rsquo;s asking &ldquo;Why are we retiring this guy&rsquo;s number when he didn&rsquo;t really do anything <em>for us</em> and was an asshole on the way out?&rdquo; When you compare Vince&rsquo;s Raptors accomplishments with the jerseys of other retired players they don&rsquo;t really even begin to compare. Shit, OKC fans have debates about retiring KD&rsquo;s jersey all the time and that&rsquo;s fucking Kevin Durant.</p>

<p>Minnesota was also a really bad expansion team for the many years when KG was on the team but you won&rsquo;t see this kind of animosity from Wolves fans when they inevitably retire his jersey because KG is beloved and was loyal to the franchise. And in a similar vein to Vince, Nuggets fans bring up a similar lack of success when it comes to not retiring Melo (famously Jokic now wears the same number), and he was a far better player than Vince and spent a longer time with the Nuggets than Vince did with the Raptors.</p>

<p>I have no personal opinion on it either way. I&rsquo;m not a Raptors fan so it&rsquo;s not Vince&rsquo;s jersey going in the rafters of my team&rsquo;s stadium (insert your &ldquo;Heat retired MJ&rsquo;s jersey&rdquo; joke here).  But I understand the sour grapes from Raptors fans just as much as I understand the reasons for why the team is retiring it anyway.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily true that you&rsquo;re damned if you request a trade at a good enough time. KG is probably still beloved if he leaves in 2006. It&rsquo;s way more about how you leave and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s arguable that the way Vince left is pretty much the poster child of reputation killing trade requests.</p>

<p>However, why are we rewarding such shitty behavior? You can’t acknowledge positive without acknowledging the negative. Seems like people just want to remember the good times but forget his petulant and unrepentant actions put us in the nba basement for a good 5 yrs.</p>

<p>Yes he was childish and immature but he was also immature because he was young and with a team that wasn&rsquo;t doing a great job keeping and building talent around him during his peak as an athlete which isn&rsquo;t a huge window for most athletes.</p>

<p>It also ignores how much he did to grow the game of basketball in Canada during his time for the Raptors. He got a lot of young Canadians interested in the game and that imo far outweighs him acting like a child during the last of his time here and forcing his way out. And if you can&rsquo;t forgive a man who acted like an ass 20 years ago you are likely more immature than he was at 27.</p>

<p>People need to stop using this as his defense.</p>

<p>The Raptors were purchased by MLSE the summer before Vince was drafted.</p>

<p>MLSE (Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment) currently owns the Jays, Raptors, TFC &amp; The Maple Leafs.  They invested a crazy amount of money into the team before Vince got there including moving them to the Air Canada Center in 1999 (his rookie year),</p>

<p>The average game was 87% sold out before Vince played a game.</p>

<p>The Raptors were a huge success and that&rsquo;s why MLSE bought them to begin with.</p>

<p>Vince Carter played 26.1% of his total NBA games with the Raptors.  We should not honor a guy who quit 26.1% of the way through his career.</p>

<p>So you have no point?</p>

<p>All you&rsquo;re telling me is about how Vince Carter made himself famous.  It had zero tangible benefit to the franchise in the long term.</p>

<p>In fact it was negative due to the press of him leaving.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t we do something like Level of Excellence like the Blue Jays? Blue Jays have only retired legends like Jackie Robinson and Roy Halladay, but plenty of note worthy players in the Level of Excellence like Carlos Delgado and Jose Bautista.</p>

<p>This way we can honor players like Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Demar DeRozen, and Kawahi. All of them have a lasting impact, but not the extent someone like Lowry.</p>

      <label for="lokygbs" class="commentText"><p>Vince Carter gets a lot of hate, maybe from younger fans who didn’t watch him play. Sure, the way things ended in Toronto is what most people remember, but you can’t deny his impact. Despite never being an MVP candidate, Vince was one of the most popular players of his era, leading All-Star voting 4 times (2000, 2001, 2002, 2004)—even ahead of stars like Iverson, Kobe, and T-Mac. He also led the 2000 Olympic gold team in scoring, pulling off the iconic &ldquo;Dunk of Death&rdquo; over a 7&rsquo;2&rdquo; center.</p>

<p>Vince made the Raptors relevant. In the 3 seasons before he arrived, the franchise averaged just 22 wins per year. After his rookie season, they went on to have 3 straight winning seasons and a bid to the playoffs with him as their main star.</p>

<p>Toronto&rsquo;s recent success might skew opinions, but after Vince left, they were bad—two 1st-round exits in the next 10 seasons (with a Bosh and Bargnani led team), with Kobe’s 81-point game as their most famous moment.</p>

<p>He might not be the only reason, but Vince played a big role in why Toronto has produced so many stars (Shai, Jamal Murray, Wiggins). Contrast that with Vancouver, which had Steve Nash, a 2x MVP, but only Kelly Olynyk has come out of there.</p>

These nephews don’t know, I been living on Lake Ontario my whole fuckin life and nobody gave a half a fuck about the Raptors before Vince was there and half the people that gave a fuck after he left only gave a half a fuck that they shouldn’t have.</p>

<p>Non team fans need a reason to watch you play fans show up even if you suck and in a city as populated as Toronto there are plenty willing.</p>

<p>The Raptors were saved by MLSE making the Leafs ticket sales in ACC require purchasing Raptors tickets as well</p>

<p>Matt Sundin has more of a claim to saving the Raptors</p>

      <label for="lokixyh" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;As part of one company (MLSE) the Raptors were in their own building and &ndash; crucially &ndash; benefited from the might of the the Leafs brand. You couldn&rsquo;t buy suites/seats for &lsquo;just&rsquo; the Leafs. You bought them for the ACC, so Raptors instantly had a strong season ticket base&rdquo;</p>
