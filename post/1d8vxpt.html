    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Some nice snippets from today&rsquo;s pod that I think provide some interesting base for discussion.</p>

<p>On their overall feelings towards the series, at 15:06:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like Boston is a really tough matchup for Dallas. The style makes the fight, and so especially in the West, where we just saw some crazy different styles matching up [&hellip;describing Dallas/OKC, Denver/MIN&hellip;] and then we get to the conference finals, and it&rsquo;s a totally different match up for both of those teams than what we just saw, and how that influences our perceptions of our teams. My assumption is there is a little bit of anti Boston, there&rsquo;s a bit of Luka-mania, because he&rsquo;s such an exciting, dynamic player and there&rsquo;s a little bit of recency bias&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Kristaps&rsquo; ability to cause problems for Dallas&rsquo;s defense, at 33:57:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Porzingis has that spacing or Al Horford, he&rsquo;s asking Derrick Lively or Daniel Gafford, are you going to sit in the paint or are you going to let me shoot a 3? And if he doesn&rsquo;t sit in the paint, then you potentially take away some of this insane shot blocking, defense, rim protection that we&rsquo;ve seen from Dallas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the disparity of predictions ranging from a short Boston series win to short Dallas series win, at 45:46:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare to go into an NBA finals series where at least from the data, both teams look very good. Yes, you can say that Boston looks better kind of across the board, but Dallas has played at a similar level and obviously just went through a harder Western Conference run. It&rsquo;s very rare to get there and see, Boston in 5, Boston 5, Dallas 5, Dallas 4, usually you would expect some to be more like a 7 game series. But it seems polarizing in terms of how people are coming at this.</p>

      <label for="l794uoz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, for sure. I also think that people really buy into the whole &ldquo;who has the best player in the series&rdquo;, which&hellip; actually tends to be a pretty good indicator, but not the end all be all of who&rsquo;s going to win. I see others (like Zach Lowe) describe Boston as having 5 of the best 7, which I think I&rsquo;m on board with.</p>

      <label for="l7adt3m" class="commentText"><p>All of his Luka content both podcast and YouTube has been positive for his entire career.</p>

<p>Even the &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Luka&rsquo;s impact match his on court production?&rdquo; video that persecution fetishist Luka stans love to reference went like this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luka Doncic is incredible. Look at all of these clips of him being incredible. He is insanely good. Just so good. One of the best offensive players in the league, maybe ever. But he&rsquo;s the only player with multiple top 5  MVP finishes ever who&rsquo;s team doesn&rsquo;t get much worse in on/off when he leaves the court so I decided to investigate why. He gives some of his offensive stuff back on defense although he is a good communicator and he can use his size to make plays sometimes. He can&rsquo;t guard the pick and roll and struggles with quickness. The primary reason I think, is that he&rsquo;s played with guards like Brunson and then Kyrie who can run the offense similarly to him when he&rsquo;s off the court. He also doesn&rsquo;t fit next to them particularly well on offense since he&rsquo;s an idle off ball player. His on/off improves in the playoffs as well. He might be the best primary read pick and roll passer in NBA history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny though because it exposes people for not watching the thing that they comment on so I&rsquo;m cool with people referencing it.</p>

<p>He literally ends the video by saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m comfortable calling him one of the 15 or 20 best offensive players of all time now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The betting line favors Celtics too much and is based too heavily on reg season numbers and not playoff basketball. </p>

<p>That being said, it should be more like -130 or -140 for Celtics, not -210 but also not + anything either.</p>

      <label for="l79ftnl" class="commentText"><p>Well depends on your definition of a big difference. Small shifts can be deceiving. Stated differently, my bet says Mavs have a ~20% higher chance (40% vs 33%) of winning than Vegas says.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a meaningful difference in my book, and it&rsquo;s also a big shift from the Vegas perspective. It&rsquo;s a matter of opinion if you&rsquo;re not betting though.</p>

      <label for="l7967dc" class="commentText"><p>Think this is a level headed take, I definitely agree. Dallas aren’t going to go down easy but I do think the Celtics will be just too much for them, especially with a healthy KP. If they go 5 out, can Gafford/Lively defend them on the perimeter and still maintain their interior rim protection? That and whether the Dallas role players will step up to keep up with Boston’s quality and depth. Those 2 big questions will decide the series</p>

<p>As an aside, betting on the Mavs should be a no brainer if you pick them to win straight up.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s logically inconsistent to not bet on the Mavs in this scenario since you basically can triple your money for something that you think is at least <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> in your favor.</p>

      <label for="l799yyr" class="commentText"><p>Most common gambling misconception</p>

<p>People recite this constantly like gospel but if you just paid a LITTLE attention you’d see it’s not true</p>

<p>The Celtics opened as -230 favorites. It has been reported that 89% of bets  are on the Mavericks. The Celtics are still roughly -230 favorites.</p>

<p>They are not trying to balance SHIT. They are in fact trying to accurately model an outcome because over the long run, THAT is how you make the most money.</p>

<p>Your (flagrantly incorrect) view of how gambling works suggests that being a profitable gambler would be way easier than it actually is because you’d just have to beat the public, not Vegas. But no.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t bet, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that normal people bet less the more risky it is.</p>

<p>In any case I&rsquo;d be astonished if Vegas actually worked as you say because there&rsquo;s no upside in hoping your model will beat market if you can simply win in either case.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, but we also know the size of those bets.  And even, to some extent, the rationale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the series opener, the Celtics are 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-point favorites, but 63% of the money has been on the Mavericks to cover the spread. Dallas is receiving 70% of the bets to win the game outright at +200.</p>

<p>“Pretty much, the public is just believing in the Mavericks,” Egeland said.</p>

<p>Despite that, the Celtics’ odds have remained consistently solid not only at BetMGM but other sportsbooks as well. Even though Egeland said professional bettors are largely sitting out this series because they don’t find much betting value, he said he didn’t expect the lines to be significantly affected.</p>

<p>“We feel it’s the correct betting line,” Egeland said. “If we were trading strictly off money, we would’ve moved it towards the Mavericks because it’s all Mavericks money. But we’re trying to get to a point where we’re at like an equilibrium — half the time (betting is) going to be on one side, half the time it’s going to go on the other. We’ve landed at 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> and that’s the strategy you take.”</p>

      <label for="l7bmqhv" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re conflating betting lines with accurate modeling. They are not the same thing. Vegas would be absolute morons to <em>not</em> move the betting lines in accordance with how much money comes in one way or the other. Depending, of course, on how much they <em>actually</em> know about the outcomes, and the stupidity/smartness of the bettors. And on some meta-factors as well.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say the initial line is -200 for Celtics, a 66% chance to win. Let&rsquo;s say Vegas has 95% confidence in their model. The first 10 million is split 6 mil to Celtics and 4 mil to Mavericks.</p>

<p>What happens?</p>

<p>Well, if Vegas has 95% confidence that 66% chance to win is correct, BUT the betting coming in &ldquo;says&rdquo; that a -200 line actually creates a 3:2 chance of winning money by betting on Celtics, that means that the mathematically correct move is to hedge the line 5% towards the &ldquo;new&rdquo; line being determined by the betting. With the assumption being that there is a 95% chance of the Vegas model being right, versus a 5% chance of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; line (-300, i think) being right. Hence Vegas ought to move their line to -205.</p>

<p>Now, all those specific numbers change dramatically based on a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Vegas&rsquo; probability models are not published so we have no idea how confident Vegas actually is with them.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m sure Vegas does a lot of analysis of public betting accuracy as well. So let&rsquo;s say their model has 95% confidence like above, it doesn&rsquo;t actually mean that more money on the Celtics has a 5% chance of being correct&hellip;because the model has a total of 5% wrongness <em>in both directions combined</em>. Not just toward the betting market. Though of course that 5% might not be distributed equally both directions either. Point is, that&rsquo;s another variable which Vegas probably knows far, far better than we do, but will never publish.</p></li>

<li><p>There is a certain degree of gamemanship and meta-betting involved in moving the line. If Vegas was simply moving their line in the most mathematically correct way every single time the incoming money disagreed with their models, it would be incredibly easy for outsiders to reverse-calculate the models themselves. PLUS, on an even simpler level, Vegas moving the line is a signal that their internal model confidence isn&rsquo;t high enough for them to keep the line where it is. Ultimately every change in the line by Vegas is a pure <em>data point</em> for bettors to use if they want to game the system at a statistical level.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very longwinded way of saying that yes, Vegas does (and should) move the line in response to the market. Even though you are also correct that in the long run, Vegas makes more money by accurately calculating the outcomes of the events. Those are not mutually exclusive truths.</p>
