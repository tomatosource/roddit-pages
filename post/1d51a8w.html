<p>These kids don’t have a reason to hate Jews, they’re kids. But their parents, culture, community, etc have been brainwashed into hate and have taught their kids to.</p>

<p>Like others have said, we sort of gloss over the idea that Germany as a whole participated in those atrocities, fueled by Nazi propaganda.</p>

      <label for="l6iprwt" class="commentText"><p>Europe as a whole participated, not only Germans. Here in Norway 800 Jews were arrested by Norwegian police and driven by Norwegian taxi drivers to the harbor to be shipped off to the concentration camps.</p>

<p>EDIT: A total of 767 Jews were deported and sent to concentration camps. Of those 26 survived. In addtion 23 jews died as a result of extrajudicial execution, murder, and suicide during the war. Total population before the war was 2173 Jews, so almost <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> managed to escape. 900 of them got help from Norwegian partisans to get over the border to Sweden, so at least we can be proud about that. There is always good people ready to stand up. Let&rsquo;s not forget that.</p>

<p>Hell, if Nazi Germany had stayed within it&rsquo;s 1939 borders and never attacked Russia/France/Englabd., chances are that WW2 never happened, no matter how many people they put in concentration camps</p>

      <label for="l6ix1be" class="commentText"><p>I don’t dispute that, but Europe as a whole has a 2000 year shameful history of progroms, but we mostly talk about the Holocaust. And the narrative is that was the Nazis only and they’re long gone. That is what I dispute. Also the germans could not have accomplished what they did without the simmering antisemitism in Europe at the time. Progroms doesn’t happen in a vacuum, there is always political and economic factors at play. See <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/political-and-economic-drivers-pogroms" target="_blank">here</a> for more on this. When the going gets though, the outgroup always gets the blame. Now Europe has exchanged antisemitism for islamophobia. Some things never change.</p>

      <label for="l6iypzo" class="commentText"><p>Can you spend a little time summarizing the differences, if any, between the masses’ hatred toward the Jews and their current angst toward Muslims? My impression was that Jewish people, although perhaps a little different with dress and beliefs, were an integrated part of society. They spoke the language, and valued the rules of the countries where they lived. Unless the sources (both written and personal) are wrong, the Muslims living in Europe today are <em>not</em> trying to integrate. They want to live in a free country, but retain their own values and religious laws. There are numerous accounts of Islamic men harassing or even attacking women, believing that their religion allows for such behavior. Is this reality or propaganda? This is not to suggest that any violence or oppression toward Muslims would be justified, certainly not. But at least academically, it would draw a distinction regarding the motivation of the populace.</p>

      <label for="l6jkopn" class="commentText"><p>Not necessarily true. Jews in medival Europe were outcasted and made to stay in their own locations. This ostracism made Jews pretty much stick amongst their own which further made it seem like they were evil or up to no good. So when you say they integrated into society, it’s partially true in the since that they paid their taxes but they certainly were never welcomed.</p>

      <label for="l6ix7ug" class="commentText"><p>A good chunk of the population needs a minority group to attack because it gives them a sense of power and removes the need to examine their own behaviour introspectively. Having no one to hate makes a lot of people realise they have no identity and deprogramming racists usually has them experiencing a major identity crisis. It&rsquo;s a very nasty part of human psychology that&rsquo;s rarely acknowledged because people like to believe we&rsquo;re too advanced as a species to have such terrible ingrained behaviours.</p>

<p>Lwów was in Poland, and this pogrom happened the <strong>very day</strong> Nazi forces first entered the city June 30 1941 - perpetrated by OUN / UPA Ukrainian nationalists, specifically Bandera / Stetsko whose monuments now adorn every city of Ukraine as national heroes. There are no Germans pictured, those kids were Ukrainian or Polish and needed no Nazi propaganda, same as their parents didn&rsquo;t need it during the 1918 Lwów pogrom (there were many others).</p>

Humans are so easy manipulated.
You just need to make someone feel morally superior for them to attack someone thats morally unsuperior for them.</p>

<p>You can see it everywhere.
Right vs left wing both feel morally superior to eachother so they have no problem treating eachother like shit.</p>

<p>Rich vs poor here the rich feel morally superior so they can take advantage of poor people without feeling any shame.</p>

<p>Its everywhere!
So dont think people have changed. Just create an narrative for people to feel morally superior and they will do anything against the other group that have no moral to them.</p>

<p>The clearest latest example is the covid vaccine where they vaccinated feelt morally superior so they could demand anything from the unvaccinated.</p>

      <label for="l6j6e7t" class="commentText"><p>It starts deeper. Those kids were raised to be cold hearted soldiers. The most famous book for mothers and doctors advice at the time told mothers  to not engage with their babies, to let them scream so they could &ldquo;strengthen their lungs&rdquo; and to make clear to them who has the say. They were only fed every 4 hours after clockwork, they advised to hold baby&rsquo;s facing away from the parents. Kids learned to answer and follow, corporal punishment was seen as good. It was purposely designed to raise soldiers who would do whatever their commander commands. There are studies that still 50 years later people in those areas have a higher rate of insecure attachment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m from Germany and I really wanted to understand how this was possible, after visiting the KZ with the school. It&rsquo;s insanely dark how badly kids, especially boys, were treated in those times.</p>

<p>But on the WW2 subject… I was an adult before I learned about the firebombings. High school before I learned about the Japanese internment camps.</p>

<p>Strangely, I don’t feel like I got much education about how evil imperial Japan was during WW2 either. They really were like evil cartoon characters (as were the Nazis, and maybe to a slightly lesser extent the Soviets).</p>

      <label for="l6ivdbc" class="commentText"><p>Japan would make for a formidable airbase to launch nuclear attacks against the Soviet Union. The US had great interest in pacifying and allying with the Japanese as quickly as they could. Thus, there was a strong incentive for the US to bring as little attention as possible to Japanese war crimes. To this day, Japan is NATO&rsquo;s most powerful global partner in East Asia, and serves as a very important base for the US to project power over the South China Sea</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s taught that for the most part, the citizenry was unaware of the atrocities. In Hebrew School, you&rsquo;re taught that the citizenry <em>did</em> know, but did nothing. Usually this was out of fear that something would happen to them in retaliation, which is absolutely fair. Doesn&rsquo;t make it right though.</p>

<p>One thing that is truly amazing about it actually relates to the sister part of the museum: the lynchings memorial, which is formally known as the National Memorial for Peace and Justice.</p>

<p>As one of the guides put it: <em>“We’ve got so many Holocaust museums and memorials and that happened across the Atlantic. Within weeks we had the Ground Zero memorial to <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.

<p>I know it&rsquo;s frustrating that the Arab and Muslim states that have consistently tried to wipe out Israel and the Jews within it for almost 80 years could not succeed, but you can hope maybe in another 80 years?</p>

<ol>
<li>History ALWAYS repeats itself.</li>
<li>3000 years of the Jewish experience on this planet says completely otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>And just like people say oh I’m not a racist, I have black friends, the same is true with anti-Semites. Look at your average progressive leftist college kid. They are literally siding with Islamofascists who want to establish a totalitarian theocratic Palestinian state, and they’re all for it. Gays for Palestine is a perfect example. How stupid can you be? Pretty fucking stupid, and pretty fucking anti-Semitic.</p>

<p>The ugly truth is, tens of millions of ordinary people would absolutely kill, rape, torture, rob, and terrorize others. Even little kids brutalizing someone in public based on ethnic/religious lines. If something like nazi Germany were to ever happen again (btw there are many militias and world governments doing stuff that’s eerily similar) it’s very likely the people perpetuating it would be your neighbor, barista, co worker, ect.</p>

<p>Im scared of dictators like hitler. But I’m much more scared of the average Joe that would follow him with conviction.</p>

      <label for="l6j2ceq" class="commentText"><p>The massacres were perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists (specifically, the OUN), German death squads (Einsatzgruppen), and urban population from 30 June to 2 July, and from 25 to 29 July, during the German invasion of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Ukrainian militia as well as Ukrainian residents and to a lower degree Poles targeted Jews in the first pogrom, which was triggered by the discovery of thousands of bodies in three Lviv prisons of victims of the Soviet NKVD prisoner massacres, which were widely blamed on &ldquo;Jewish Bolsheviks&rdquo;. The subsequent massacres were directed by the Germans in the context of the Holocaust in Eastern Europe. The pogroms have been widely debated in the historiography, including the extent to which Ukrainian nationalists played a central or complicit role.
It’s not a secret a lot of Jews were indeed holding high positions in Soviets oppressive regime apparatus - NKWD. Simple people do what they love best draw conclusions based on race or religion.</p>
