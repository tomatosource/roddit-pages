</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My daughter (8 years old) has been asking for Roblox for a while. Most of her friends play it and it&rsquo;s such a popular game, I figured it had to have some value. After all, I think Minecraft is a fantastic game with lots of opportunities for creativity and quality interactions with friends, so I assumed Roblox was on a similar level.</p>

<p>I started playing Roblox with my daughter, and holy cow, it is 98% money grabs. Much like the low-effort mobile games that constantly prompt microtransactions. Am I missing something, or is Roblox just complete garbage? There are a few games like Doors that aren&rsquo;t too bad, but my daughter is, of course, gravitating towards the high-dopamine-triggering pay-to-win type games.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve limited her time on it and explained my reasoning, but I&rsquo;d love to maybe find some decent games that she enjoys playing and that aren&rsquo;t pure cash-grabbing fluff. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>

<p>She can play all the wants&hellip;but I&rsquo;m never giving her money to buy skins, points, or any kind of in game currency&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also teaching her about gambling while teaching her math.  She has 0 interest in going to gamble after losing day after day to me.  I&rsquo;m ruthless.</p>

<p>Her friend has all kinds of money for robux, Minecraft skins, and all kinds of bullshit&hellip;</p>

<p>I taught her to use what the game comes with to come up with unique and interesting combos&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all about balance.. you can&rsquo;t just BAN a game that 80 percent of her friends are playing.  It&rsquo;s mostly harmless bullshit games.  No worse than anything we played when we were kids in the 80s and 90s..</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t even need tell you how many absolute dogshit games I played on my PC in the 90s&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l5padl3" class="commentText"><p>This. If anything, it&rsquo;s been a great talking point with my kids about scams and / or transaction that have little to no benefit to them (robux spent on that specific game vs. Cosmetics that you can take anywhere) but I use real world money as the example. Especially hits home for things that accelerate XP gains or what not. Had them pay me to get the XP skip that I did by hand. Handed it back to them with them being 3 dollars poorer and the game asking them to pay again to skip.</p>

<p>And agreed, I played a ton of trash growing up, but it&rsquo;s this micro and macro transaction assault that our children are just going to be used to. Hopefully, teaching them the value of money and the fact that all these trash games are just trying to take it from them will create a more resilient gamer crowd to the major transaction bullshit.</p>

<p>My kids are younger, but I can&rsquo;t help crack up when one shouts to me that this ad they are watching is a scam.</p>

They were pressured into it by media and primarily financial motives when partners stopped selling their voucher credits - My point linking that specific game was it is, to my eyes, an identical situation. You have vulnerable/young people on one platform, competing over status with in game purchases&rdquo;)</p>

      <label for="l5p8l81" class="commentText"><p><em>Roblox is the doomscrolling of video games.</em>  It&rsquo;s also known for having a lot of pedophiles, while also becoming an addictive habit for kids. I watched my daughter show a lot of signs of video game addiction at age 5, something I&rsquo;ve struggled with myself from age 6 right up until I got therapy this year (age 33). So I yanked her off Roblox as soon as I saw that. Plus, it&rsquo;s an absolute money sink if you let them spend a dime on it.</p>

<p>My advice as one parent to another, get rid of that absolute trash asap. Kid might not understand and will be frustrated with you, but life is so much healthier without it. Just don&rsquo;t start down that path at all. Get Minecraft instead! Much more creative, far higher quality public servers, way more opportunities for you to join your child in play, and a lot more control over social interactions with strangers (I simply turned that off and suggest any parent do the same). My daughter and I play for 45 minutes a day, and we have one creative server, and one survival surver, plus the occasional public server!</p>

<p>After more than a year of no Roblox my now 7 year old gets it. There&rsquo;s very few games worth playing on Roblox to justify the mountain of issues it brings.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, there&rsquo;s a tonne of really inappropriate murder games with gore that you just can&rsquo;t filter out. That was another big reason I got rid of it, I couldn&rsquo;t be watching over her shoulder every moment even when I tried my best. Roblox is brainrot for kids.</p>

<p>Then the clickbait years set in with “fake” games running rampant, gear became prohibited in most games, and eventually tickets were phased out. It just went downhill from there.</p>

<p>Such a shame, really. At its peak, it was fun and had a ton of potential. Not even sure it could be salvaged at this point…</p>

After doing some of my own research, it looks safe as long as chat and age restrictions are enforced. Still lots of mindless nonsense on there, but nobody can communicate with my daughter as far as I can tell. I supervise most of her time on it.</p>

      <label for="l5p5pe6" class="commentText"><p>Roblox shows up in the development community a lot for their exploitation of children for creating content and how they don&rsquo;t protect those kids from adults, nor help them succeed over profit-seekers. But that&rsquo;s a totally different concern.</p>

<p>Just make sure you vet the maps she can go to and try to avoid anything that can get around the safety systems. Not sure if it&rsquo;s changed, but there used to be map makers who would make ways for adults to talk to kids, or introduce aspects like gambling, or use non-text blocks to add visual text asking people to go to a website.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no matter what, safety systems are never perfect. The best thing you can do is start teaching her digital literacy and safety. It&rsquo;s an unfortunate reality and as she gets into her teens it will be almost impossible to control access. I&rsquo;ve seen too many young girls predated upon (one very nearly kidnapped) in avoidable circumstances had they been given some guidance on&hellip; You know.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to understand her hobby!</p>

      <label for="l5pmrmx" class="commentText"><p>People are so paranoid about every little thing these days because some anecdotal something happening somewhere. Everybody is out to get us all. You can’t possibly shield your child from every single thing in the world that a small majority of people have used for evil. You might as well just coat them in bubble wrap and never let them go outside. I am also active in my son’s activity. I play with him and understand the things that he is into. Sometimes they’re borderline inappropriate and we steer clear. Ultimately, Roblox itself is not the enemy. It’s just too much effort for parents who want to live on autopilot so they throw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak.</p>

      <label for="l5ppsmh" class="commentText"><p>Well&hellip; yeah! Instances of this happening are <em>exceptionally</em> rare. In part because of all the effort spent fighting it, but mostly because pdeophiles themselves are pretty rare. Let your kids play outside, most of us here have the blessing to live in a safe world.</p>

<p>At the same time, it is important to be <em>conscientious</em>. Nobody chooses to be a victim, it&rsquo;s largely a roll of the dice. Minimize exposure to dark alley;s have some sanity systems: an open line of communication, regular check-ins, an established relationship of blameless trust &amp; care, etc; and at least try to stay involved in what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I recommended teaching them how to use smarts, rather than banning it. Vet stuff when they&rsquo;re young, teach them how to stay safe, and you&rsquo;re cooking with oil. Driving oneself crazy being paranoid will only hurt their mental health and make the kid resent them, anyway.</p>

It is indeed 98% hot garbage but we&rsquo;ve enjoyed hunting for the rare quality games and saving those to play again. It reminds me of browsing the web in the 90s when everyone was self publishing their pages so it was all a mess of bad html and misplaced animated GIFs. You&rsquo;d usually spend a minute on the page before looking for a new one.</p>

<p>I refuse to purchase Robux for him, though. I don&rsquo;t want him to think any of the predatory tactics that the developers use is ok so I&rsquo;ve completely taken purchases off the table. He seems fine with that as long as he can play.</p>

      <label for="l5p5tsn" class="commentText"><p>Nope, it&rsquo;s mostly garbage.  There&rsquo;s a few higher effort things on there like Doors or various obstacle courses (obbys), but most of if is people trying to get your Robux like you mentioned.  I&rsquo;ve got 2 boys  (11 and 8) who play it.  They play with their real-life friends online though and as kids who can be a little shy around others I feel like that&rsquo;s helpful.  It also gives them something to talk to other kids about.  That and Minecraft.</p>

<p>I hate them asking for Robux.  It feels like such a waste of money so I never buy any with my own money outside of a small gift card for their birthday or whatever, but I do allow them to use their own money from time to time on it.  Maybe it will help with budgeting skills in the future?  Probably not, but that&rsquo;s what I tell myself to make it more palatable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping you&rsquo;ve had conversations with your girl about online safety.  If not, do so.</p>

<p>Though the games were different, saving up for that steam gift card was definitely valuable to do. The feeling of independence it gives them is probably a good stepping stone for life.</p>

<p>Plus those robucks might be worthless in reality, but to a kid they&rsquo;re as good as gold and they&rsquo;ll remember wasting their money on them and having fun with it for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Feels like last month and 100 years ago at the same time that I was asking my mom for gift cards lmao</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a long-time Roblox player, I played it as a kid 15 years ago, and I still come back to it for nostalgia sake once in a while. I&rsquo;ve definitely noticed a decline in quality. PF is long past its prime, but there are still many cool shooters. I&rsquo;ve been sticking to Arsenal as my shooter of choice. Recently, I started playing Frontlines, which is really well made and barely resembles Roblox at first glance.</p>

<p>Roblox can be used to create basically anything,
It’s not all bad, it’s just the main motivation for most Roblox games is money, which is why most of them end up being low effort cash grabs</p>

      <label for="l5plxgw" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s been cash grabs ever since they removed Tix, let devs cash in Robux for real money, and made getting kids to buy things in your game the only way to profit.
Before then, it was just about making fun games that people want to visit, or clickbaiting them into visiting. Maybe upsell them on a VIP t-shirt, but not as the main point of the game.</p>

<p>When they added the feature to convert your Robux to real money, the entire platform shifted into pure greed. It was pretty sad to see everything change.</p>

      <label for="l5pf0v2" class="commentText"><p>Professional game developer and father of two here. IMO, Roblox is effectively an interactive marketplace for kids to hang out while they chat with their friends.</p>

<p>As someone who takes media and its consumption very seriously, I would agree that Roblox is 98% trash, and that the remaining 2% do not justify its hard drive space.</p>

<p>Roblox and Fortnite are detrimental to the exploration, discovery, and experience of what makes video games remotely close to art. They are akin to listening only to pop radio. Catchy and addictive, but generally shallow and meaningless.</p>

<p>Non gamer parents typically lack the experience to distinguish the wheat from the chaff, so that equate games as games. I find the kids who grow up loving games for their intrinsic value (as opposed to being addicted to them) are the ones who are able to find single player or at least, offline experiences they can enjoy.</p>

<p>My eldest beat Paper Mario Origami King when he was 7. Without spoiling it, he learned about sacrifice and loss. We had to console him for days. The game moved him deeply. Our younger one is now playing Lil Gator Game, which is effectively &ldquo;Baby&rsquo;s First Zelda&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s incredibly well done. And both of them loved playing Cat Quest II together. If you&rsquo;re looking to find something to play with your daughter, I&rsquo;d recommend looking into that.</p>

      <label for="l5plprb" class="commentText"><p>Roblox and fortnite dont aim to be emotionally moving, formative experiences for kids. They aim to just be something fun you can do for however long you want and just have some mindless fun.</p>

<p>Roblox is 98% predatory, garbage but the 2% of games on there are pretty fun and simple but can be played for hours on end.</p>

<p>Not every game needs to blow you away with emotional gut punches. Some games just want to be something fun to do for an hour</p>

<p>As a parent thought you obviously want to try to steer your kid towards substantive fare, rather than skinner boxes designed to provoke compulsive behavior in still developing minds. </p>

<p> Like, if my kid asks me to put something on YouTube for him to watch, I&rsquo;m not going to willingly put on unboxing videos for him. He can wander to that on his own of course and I can&rsquo;t stop that fully, but if he&rsquo;s asking for my help/input I&rsquo;m certainly going to try to counteract it</p>

I had similar gaming experiences growing up and I think a big part of that has to do with the limited availability of games. I had to stick with what I had. It&rsquo;s so easy now to drop a game as soon as it loses some novelty and move on to something else.</p>

Galleons was one of my favorites, where 2 fully destructible pirate ships would battle it out and players could steer them, man the cannons, and aim for the enemy’s powder barrels. There were cool obstacle courses, a great Heli Rescue from zombies game, all sorts of cool stuff. It’s sad to hear it’s mostly crap these days.</p>

<p>I am a gamer.</p>

<p>I would not give my kid a mobile phone.</p>

<p>I would not let my kid play roblox.</p>

<p>The big problem with Roblox is that the environment is COMPLETELY uncontrolled and Roblox is taking 0 responsibility for what&rsquo;s there.  There are way too many dangerous rabbit holes that a kid can end up in, in terms of content or financial.  Not okay with that.</p>

<p>I am responsible for my kid, that&rsquo;s why they won&rsquo;t be touching Roblox.  There&rsquo;s absolutely no way I can control what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>

<p>Category Y</p>

<p>Category Z</p>

<p>Kind of like a written Venn Diagram.</p>

<p>However, what&rsquo;s super weird is their first point, they are not a parent. That probably explains why they think that they know what they would or wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>I hate to break it to everyone out there: that&rsquo;s not usually how it works out. Your kid might get to play it with friends at school, an after school program, a friend&rsquo;s house. No matter how hard you try, you do not control your children, so you have to figure out how to navigate and negotiate and successfully sway them or help them make choices.</p>

<p>And not just the amount, you’re conditioning your kids from a young age to spend money on microtransaction regularly. They’d have a idea that “oh no, I’m out of money. It’s okay, I’ll wait for next month papa is gonna give me another $20 to buy this item”</p>

<p>I think the best way is to set up a merit system. If you achieve xyz, then I’d promise to give you x amount of pocket money. Make it clear that you allow, but discourage spending those money on robux or any microtransactions</p>

<p>My son plays Roblox, although not as much now.</p>

<p>But he loooooved playing it with his friends. He has an allowance and would spend some money on it here and there, sometimes dropping 5 bucks on it every other Friday to have fun with his friends.</p>

<p>It reminded me of when I was younger and would bother my mom to go to blockbuster to rent some games for the weekend. I spent a few bucks and was entertained for the weekend. Or dropping $20 at the arcade.</p>

<p>Monitor it but let her have her fun. Most games are free, and there&rsquo;s some good ones. No harm in dropping a little bit of cash on it if she&rsquo;s enjoying herself.</p>

<p>But I always stressed to my son that he needed to play with people he knew in real life. From class, neighborhood, or from his karate team.</p>

The <em>with their friends</em> part is the important bit, the actual game doesn&rsquo;t matter too much. They&rsquo;re young enough that they won&rsquo;t have a great idea of what&rsquo;s a good game or not, they just want to hang out or at least not be left out of the conversation when they&rsquo;re with their friends in-person and they&rsquo;re all talking about it.</p>

<p> Seriously though, there are a few games that are fun w/out pay to win. I think the trick will be to teach your daughter the difference so she can learn to game for enjoyment and not bypassing gameplay by buying things for quick gratification.</p>

      <label for="l5p8c03" class="commentText"><p>Think of it as a framework and hosting site. So anyone can make an &ldquo;experience&rdquo; quite quickly, and can fill it with micro-transactions easily. As the risk is low (roblox does all the hosting) and the potential reward is quite high. Since its not &ldquo;real money&rdquo; kids just spend as much as they can with no concept of value.</p>

      <label for="l5pd3gd" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s known to be an exploitative platform that cashes in on the work of self-published works. The people who make the games tend to be children, and the target audience are children as well. If possible, stay away from platform that is solely dependent on the work of others, especially via microtransactions.</p>

<p>Actual creative games such as Minecraft are far better and safer. The singleplayer mode is safe and an experience all on its own, and it&rsquo;s you can play together in a multiplayer instance where you&rsquo;d be working together toward the same goal. It would be a far better bonding activity.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re needing to choose between the 2, go with Minecraft. Creative games, ones actually developed by the game developers themselves, are a good choice for letting them experiment with things. An alternative would be something like Terraria.</p>

<p>That said, you could then sit down and compare the 2 with your child to teach them about the dangers of predatory practices afterward. Point out how 1 game asks for money to essentially skip the actual playing part, while the other one makes the playing itself fun and enticing all on its own.</p>

But this also allows for maximum creative freedom with games, which can result in a lot of very high quality, unique stuff, you just have to spend a lot of time looking, and it’ll almost never be on the front page. there are also a lot of less violent clones of popular m rated games, like cod and cod zombies.</p>

Hes since been able to just ignore or put aside games that are blatantly pay to win and gravitate more towards those that reward good old fashioned grinding and/or skill. That and ive also taugh him how autoclickers and macros work, so he gets a leg-up when he needs to 😉. Now when i play with him, and when im cheated to use robux because i have some on my account, he calls me out and says &ldquo;no cheating! Robux is bad!&rdquo; And i just cower like a little bitch and let him kivk me around with his OP character builds 😂😭</p>

      <label for="l5p6sen" class="commentText"><p>Hey, I&rsquo;ve been on Roblox since I was about 11, started playing at around 2012 and slowly stopped to play less and less as the games and the platforms direction changed, managing to publish a few games of my own and monetize my knowledge of the platform so here&rsquo;s my take on the current situation on Roblox:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that the frontpage is filled with 90% brainrot-garbage games, however there are a few really well put together games that I still can sink a hundred hours into with a couple of my friends, without needing to spend money, however those games will usually have 500 or so people playing at any given time if not less, and they definitely WONT be on the front page, if you want your child to have a good quality Roblox experience I suggest you go on the r/roblox subreddit and ask for some good quality games there.</p>

<p>My personal recommendation for an 8 year old would be Bloxburg, it lets you get a job and &ldquo;grind&rdquo; for in game money which you can use to decorate and change up your house, similar to the SIMS games.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

If your daughter is 8, your daughter won&rsquo;t find anything (most likely) that are far from childish and she would probably find low quality money-grab games that are appealing to 8 yr olds. You can find lots of fun remakes of actual games and games based on them, ex. exit 8 and its roblox counterpart corridor, and many high quality games. Roblox does not have malware or things like that, and child predators should be no concern as long as you teach your child online etiquette. Hidden treasures can be found, you have to look for them harder now.</p>

      <label for="l5pguhm" class="commentText"><p>In the early days, you couldn’t make money from ROBLOX without extraneous circumstances. Back in 2014-ish (?) they introduced DevEx which allowed developers to exchange their robux for real life USD.</p>

<p>Ever since that decision was made, the main objective of development on ROBLOX strayed away from creativity and moved towards a money-oriented model. Make a game as quick and cheaply as possible, while also making as much money as possible. It’s basically gambling for children right now with all the microtransactions.</p>

<p>They’re also moving User Generated Content (UGC) into their avatar catalog for all users now. The issue being its rampant with IP and copyright abuse.</p>

<p>I love ROBLOX. I’ve played it since 2008. But despite maturing as a platform, the business choices they’ve made to attract talented developers and increase revenue (now being a public company) have driven down quality immensely and put children in an environment that is akin to gambling in most popular ROBLOX games. There are still quality games out there, but you usually need to dig deep to find them.</p>

      <label for="l5pinjw" class="commentText"><p>Hey, as someone who used to play Roblox as a young teen (now 20) I severely urge you to go research into how predatory and unsafe Roblox can be for young children nowadays.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty controversial YouTuber called &ldquo;RubenSim&rdquo; who makes videos exposing pedophiles and other creeps on the game, and how Roblox fails to protect young users from them. I suggest you please Google his channel and watch some of his videos. He&rsquo;s no saint himself, but he does a good job showing just how fucked Roblox is nowadays.</p>

<p>Roblox also suffers from a really bad &ldquo;online dating&rdquo; thing. It was like that way back when I used to play as a kid, but it&rsquo;s only gotten worse. Waaaaaaaay worse.</p>

<p>And like you said the predatory monetization. Every game nowadays has pop-ups telling you to buy X,Y,Z and the social nature of Roblox is geared around social pressure to kit out your avatar, with you guessed it- paid cosmetics. Like people will straight up insult you if you &ldquo;look poor&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s this culture around &ldquo;looking good&rdquo; in game that encourages players to spend money. It will only be a matter of time before your kid starts asking for &ldquo;Robux&rdquo; (the in game currency) I guarantee you.</p>

<p>Please keep her away from this shit.</p>

      <label for="l5pj277" class="commentText"><p>Roblox now is absolutely Garbage. As someone who played in 2017, It was previously enjoyable since people posted video game content that they produced out of passion and creativity, rather than focusing on obtaining robux/money. There really isn&rsquo;t any games I can suggest for your daughter since majority of the great creators on roblox have left.</p>

      <label for="l5pjf3n" class="commentText"><p>My five, almost six, year old plays and I play with him. There’s some games where the solicitations are way over the top but mostly they are for cosmetics and cutting corners. They annoy me but don’t really do much beyond that. I had my son on a subscription for a few months but he will spend robux in literally every game and then never play it again so I shut that off.</p>

there are &ldquo;clones&rdquo; of most popular games,game modes,etc in roblox so they still had fun w friends w a bit less blood ,but you still have to monitor because there are some not so nice games and people on there..</p>

<p>good moment to teach about paying for virtual stuff and (not) wasting money on that</p>

      <label for="l5pnwmn" class="commentText"><p>I played Roblox when I was 12. (I&rsquo;m 26 now) I spent a lot of my time on games like survive a canoe ride down a river, work at a pizza place, Roblox High School, Survive the Natural Disasters, Town of Robloxia, and later delved into military clan roleplay.</p>

<p>I still play Roblox every now and then, but I definitely think the game has taken a turn for the worse, with the removal of tix and so many cash-grab games on the front page (one high school roleplay game had a seperate paid pass for every single item in your inventory and to even pull the fire alarm or write on the chalkboard). Now when to make anything is now locked behind Roblox Studio, which could be confusing for little ones to get familiar with. Before you could build while you were in the game and for a brief while they did a nice little in game building system complete with different brick types and furniture sets. That&rsquo;s mostly all gone now. It&rsquo;s a game I wouldn&rsquo;t let my own kids play when they were my age.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still some gems, but they are buried behind many, many, many layers of garbage.</p>

<p>Minecraft is better.</p>

The stuff that is well made and ISN&rsquo;T a cash grab is hidden away in recommended sections of games and made for older kids who are interested in that kind of game. RPG&rsquo;s, FPS&rsquo;s, even card games are on there, but she probably has no interest in those right now.</p>

<p>The same way that the mobile gaming industry got destroyed by addictive money-grabbing shit, Roblox is essentially the same.</p>

<p>Note that by &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo;, I mean creatively. The problem is that the crap we call mobile gaming today is <strong>commercially</strong> highly successful. In the same way cocain is more profitable than, say, cotton.</p>

<p>It might be hard, but keep your kid away from both, cocaine and Roblox.</p>

      <label for="l5pxct4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. I&rsquo;m 15, so the game&rsquo;s older than me, but I started playing in 2019, when I was about two years older than your daughter. There are some decent games, such as disaster survival, (the 725 stage obby is one of the best obbys btw, as well as some difficulty chart obbys), Bloxemburg, Club Roblox for designing stuff, and it&rsquo;s a lot better to play with friends. Make sure to always check her friends list, as there are predators on roblox, as with every children&rsquo;s game, and never give her voice chat, but maybe start a zoom call with her friends so they can talk. But yeah, 99% is trash, dopamine hits</p>
