<p>Knicks are a little overrated. Bridges is a fantastic pick up, but people are overlooking how big of a loss hartenstein is imo.</p>

<p>Also getting back Brandon Clarke who missed most of last year.</p>

      <label for="lkw5c99" class="commentText"><p>Listen, Brooks is a good defender, but I&rsquo;m not moved by him being off the team. I don&rsquo;t put much stock in Pat Bev type players. Adams did a lot for the team, but I feel like as long as Eddy is good enough to get consistent minutes, his size alone will help fill the void</p>

      <label for="lkw52dd" class="commentText"><p>Overrated: Cavs. I said the same thing last offseason and my view hasn’t changed. I don’t think JB was a good coach, but he wasn’t the main issue. It’s the fit. Mobley Allen doesn’t work. Mitchell Garland doesn’t work. They don’t suck obviously, but they aren’t contenders.</p>

<p>Also shout out Spurs. Talking heads are being so annoying about them already.</p>

<p>Underrated: Grizzlies for sure. The argument that they were only good because the West was weak a couple of years ago doesn’t really jive with everyone constantly saying the West is miles better than the East. Which is it? I’m inclined to believe the Grizzlies were and are the real deal. Ja is top 15.</p>

      <label for="lkw6isq" class="commentText"><p>I do think the Grizzlies will be very good but the West they were the 2 seed in for two years is not the West of today. There were six under teams under .500 both those years with the bottom absolutely tanking hardcore while last season there were only four under .500 teams with the hospital Grizzlies being one of them. Only two teams in the West are expected to tank (the Jazz and Blazers) and the rest will at least be trying to make the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lkw4w10" class="commentText"><p>Bucks for underrated, Trent Jr is a starting SG in the league, Prince and Delon will make good 7-8th men, Giannis/Brook on they had a top 5 defense, i think Dame will look closer to his superstar self, and they&rsquo;ll win around 55 games</p>

<p>Warriors for overrated, mainly cause i&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people say they got better this year, and i just don&rsquo;t see it, they got depth, but none of those players will take any pressure off of Steph who&rsquo;ll still be out there fighting for his life, even more now cause at least Klay was still a can&rsquo;t leave him open at all player</p>

      <label for="lkw5csf" class="commentText"><p>Overrated: the nuggets</p>

<p>they lost their best poa and downgraded in shooting by default by adding russ and promoting christian braun.</p>

<p>Bucks: their only really positive addition on both ends was delon wright so they’re looking into being a bottom 20 defense again.</p>

<p>Magic: double downed on elite defense but their offense is still gonna be bad. I would be really high on them if they traded for simons</p>

<p>Underrated: kings</p>

<p>Ppl underestimated how good they could be next year offensively and also exaggerate how bad their defense is(14th). They got better on both ends by adding demar and drafting devin carter(won’t play till like feb the earliest but still)</p>

<p>Cavs: they were really injured last season and were literally the 2 seed late into the szn before mitchell got hurt. Theyre a guaranteed 50+ wins to me if they’re healthy</p>

      <label for="lkw2np3" class="commentText"><p>Overrated: The sixers, will be good in the regular season and will get eliminated in the second round when Embiid or Paul George are inevitably not healthy come playoff time</p>

<p>Overrated: The Bucks, People saying they will go deep just cuz Giannis. Giannis also hasn’t been healthy the last couple playoffs from carrying his team too much. Have to rely on an aging roster not declining. And they didn’t figure anything out last year in terms of chemistry between Giannis and Dame prior to Giannis’s injury. Their defense is still horrendous and idk how they expect it to improve. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re fighting to get out of the play-in for a 5-6 seed</p>
