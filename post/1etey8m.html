    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Pick a team that is going to underperform based on their expectations. So you can pick a team that are seen as championship contenders and you see as an early playoff exit. Or a playoff team that you feel might even struggle to make the play in as well.</p>

<p>I feel like that team will be the grizzles tbh. The amount of people predicting them to be a top 3 seed to me. The west has gotten a lot better over the past two offseasons and I don’t see them coming back and going straight to the top of the conference just by getting their stars back. I think they will still be good but likely a play in team due to how great the conference is. What team do you think will underperform?</p>

      <label for="licp9aa" class="commentText"><p>I am very worried about my Nuggets. Murray looks like he has lost two steps and has a long injury history. He was terrible in the playoffs but it was masked by his two gamer winners against the Lakers. He was even worse in the Olympics. KCP is gone, who was very important and underrated. MPJ cannot be counted on to be consistent. This is becoming a two man team with Jokic and Gordon. Murray is not the same guy.</p>

In reality we will likely still be a top 4 seed but the question is whether we are a real contender which is where I have significant concern. </p>

      <label for="lidamlh" class="commentText"><p>I think there floor is even lower. The loss of depth and Murray worries are just one side of a coin. The West is insanely good right now.</p>

<p>I  think at this point Minny/OKC are in a class by themselves. Dallas deserves cred. Phoenix, sac, Houston and GS all should be better.</p>

<p>Denver has more championship equity than those other teams, but they just don&rsquo;t have the legs for an 82 game season. Players even admitted that they were gassed against Minnesota. Murray needs to sit 20 games, and you really need to find rest for joker. The rest of the team is so bad, they are not going to be able to compete in the regular season for 55 wins.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they made a tactical decision to aim for avoiding the play-in. I don&rsquo;t think they have a chance at The top two or three seeds.</p>

Jokic doesn&rsquo;t have a big injury history, but we&rsquo;ve seen cases like this before: David Robinson getting injured in 1997 and Spurs go from a 2 seed in the West to 3rd worst team in the NBA. Nuggets, more than any other title contender, are 1 injury away from disaster.</p>

<p>MPJ for sure, but the upside on him is the Lakers series and the downside is the Timberwolves series.</p>

<p>Also for all we know, Braun could really take a step forward and fill KCPs role.</p>

      <label for="lictsu7" class="commentText"><p>I feel the opposite. I see so much about how they’re going to be out of the play-in without PG when the guy couldn’t even average 20 against Dallas with Kawhi out and was fouling non stop on defense.</p>

<p>They picked up a lot of good defenders like DJJ, Dunn and Batum to boost their defense and on offense Harden showed in the playoffs that he can still be an elite second option and Kawhi when he was healthy last season was still at minimum a top 10, if not top 5 player.</p>

<p>Plus Ty Lue always gets the most out of his teams as we saw for example in the 2021-22 season when PG missed over half the season and Kawhi was out entirely.</p>

<p>Also can’t underestimate the boost that new arena will give them.</p>

<p>I disagree with the PG point. Yes he was ass vs the Mavs but he was legitimately good in the regular season and the on/off numbers reflect that.</p>

<p>Also the Harden solo show doesn’t work anymore, so if Kawhi gets injured for any extended period of time they’re kinda cooked. He played the most he has since 2017, not sure if that’s gonna be replicated</p>

      <label for="lid208b" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m more in line with this. We saw the Clippers without Kawhi for a whole year who at the end of the season finished 7th/8th (?) and then missed the playoffs due to the play in tournament, where PG missed the 2nd game&hellip;</p>

<p>This was also with PG missing games here and there like he usually does. I don&rsquo;t expect Kawhi to be amazing, but he will still be on the team along with Harden.</p>

<p>I think we added much more versatility and depth to the roster, and overall seem more defensive minded than last. Biggest issue is once again not having a reliable back up big.</p>

<p>I don’t really think we belong in a discussion about ‘massively underperforming’ though. Clippers don’t have much expectations at all. A lot of people don’t expect us to even make a play in game.

      <label for="lid2zy4" class="commentText"><p>Lakers, Clippers, and Suns are all in the same tier for me where if they can keep their top guys healthy they’ll probably be a 6-8 seed, but it’s much more likely they suffer at least one major injury and miss the playoffs. Like out of those 3 teams, probably one gets lucky with health and makes the playoffs and whichever other two teams get less lucky are out.</p>

      <label for="lid527k" class="commentText"><p>They are not 6-8 bruh lol. Thats why my answer is Lakers cause you guys heavily overestimate them.</p>

<p>OKC, Twolves, Denver, Kings, Dallas, Grizzlies have Top 6 on lock.</p>

<p>Pels have Big 3 Zion, BI, DeJounte. Spurs added CP3 and Barnes to a 2nd year Victor.</p>

<p>I have them 9 onwards and PHX is definitely the best of the 3. Just added Tyus Jones and the role players are much better. That leaves Clippers vs Lakers and my money is on the Clippers cause they finished much higher this yr.</p>

<p>Leonard not at the Olympics is also a blessing in disguise cause Bron and AD would be tired first 30 games like Austin after FIBA and Bron is already a known coaster.</p>

I’m saying that ONE of the Suns, Clippers, and Lakers will probably get lucky with health and grab one of the bottom playoff spots while the others will be on the outside looking in. If I were to tier then it would be:</p>

<p>Favorites: Thunder</p>

<p>Dark horses: Pelicans, Mavs</p>

<p>Playoff teams: Rockets, Warriors</p>

<p>Year after year, the media hypes them up like they&rsquo;re gonna be strong contenders only for them to continuously never make it past the 2nd round. All I can do is roll my eyes at them hyping them up again even with PG there. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what pieces they have. Even if they can dominate other teams, they won&rsquo;t make it past the celtics. Celtics are their daddy.</p>

DJM-herb-trey-zion with CJ off the bench is a better squad than last year, but BI clogs the wing rotation and takes more valuable touches away from DJM and zion. having to start either missi or theis is also near malpractice - if the deadline doesnt involve some major moves i think that team is cooked</p>

They should&rsquo;ve traded BI when he&rsquo;s of really high value. He&rsquo;s still a valuable asset that can help the right team but the Pels needs might not be completely satisfied from the returns.</p>

From the little I know about the 4 of them, they seem to play different from eachother, and I am curious what sort of center will end up working best. Personally I have high hopes for Markovic, but that opinion is based on zero basketball knowledge, and some summer league</p>

<p>Nothing against Valanciunas, but he clearly wasn&rsquo;t working out with the coaching staff, and never really looked great next to Zion, so I&rsquo;m happy he went and got paid somewhere else.</p>

<p>The Kings had a crazy combination of injury luck and close game luck iirc. Meanwhile the Nuggets and Clippers won even more games last year than the year before with the same roster.</p>

<p>The west also wasn’t bad in 2021-2022 when our baby team did it, too.</p>

      <label for="lid9m0c" class="commentText"><p>I think they expect internal improvement to handle both, but I buy an uptick in slashing more than shooting. Their shooters have to be more willing to fire shit up.</p>

<p>But if I had to call a hole in the roster, it&rsquo;s actually high level playmaking. SGA and JDub are like B level playmakers, and there are a lot of willing passers on the roster, but there isn&rsquo;t anyone who is great at skip passes and high level reads like that to break stout playoff defenses. Giddey was supposed to be that guy but if you can&rsquo;t bend a defense, there&rsquo;s no skip passes to be thrown. I think the guys they drafted and Dieng have those types of passes in their bag but they all have to earn minutes doing other stuff first.</p>

<p>Some people here and there may be saying that the grizzlies are a possible top three seed, but that’s not the general expectation. Their general expectation is more like a  6-9 seed, in other words similar to the OP’s expectations.</p>

<p>So are we going on general expectations or only on the most optimistic expectations that you might find somewhere out there?</p>

<p>On the other hand, PG is aging and injury prone. He&rsquo;s going to take away touches from Maxey and Embiid, maybe he makes their bench scoring better, but I actually think the starter&rsquo;s offense will get worse.</p>

      <label for="lid88lj" class="commentText"><p>Going based off of an article from a month ago on FOX Sports detailing <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> win Projections:</p>

<p>Denver - 52.5: just ask the Warriors how multiple long playoff runs can eventually wear on the body. The loss of KCP is bigger than most realize, Murray and MPJ&rsquo;s injury history raise concerns. But the Joker might be the new Duncana re: forcing his team to 50 wins.</p>

<p>Memphis - 46.5: I get that the young talent on this team is stout and has great chemistry, but asking them to hop right back into the thick of the Western Conference after a trying year is a tall task. I&rsquo;m not nearly as bullish on this team as most seem to be</p>

<p>Warriors- 43.5: to my memory, the last time that Steph Curry was the only + player in the lineup, this team was drafting 2nd overall the following spring. All that has happened since then is Draymond is older and less efficient instead of injured, Klay is gone instead of injured and Wiggins production has plummeted. This Win total seems to be inflated by the prospect of a potential Lauri Markkanen trade but even then, is that two man game enough to make the play-in out West?</p>

<p>San Antonio - 35.5: another year of development for Wemby cannot be overstated. He&rsquo;s going to be a phenomenal star for as long as the fates allow. And I wish him all the best. But is a CP3/Wemby PnR really enough to elevate this team to 35 wins? I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised by another season of sparkling Wemby stat lines en route to a 25-57 record.</p>

      <label for="lid9702" class="commentText"><p>Because we can&rsquo;t have nice things and being a Wolves fan has conditioned me to be pessimistic. But realistically, I worry about KAT&rsquo;s knee and Rudy&rsquo;s offensive limitations. He showed some good stuff near the end of the regular season, but outside of that fadeaway against the Nuggets, didn&rsquo;t do much on that end in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lida65j" class="commentText"><p>We can only build on our success from last year. We had a historic defense mainly because of Rudy, Ant is in a Superstar leap, KAT should be healthy and he&rsquo;s happy playing 2nd fiddle to Ant. That alone is enough to be optimistic, but imagine the growth of Naz, Jaden, Dilly, even NAW. There&rsquo;s plenty of things to look forward to and get the Minnesota sports curse shit out of your head lol</p>

      <label for="lid2mgy" class="commentText"><p>If I had to pick one team, it would be the Suns. 3 of their top 4 players are clearly on the downslope of their careers and KD and Nurkic both had incredible injury luck last year relative to their recent history while
Booker and Beal both played more games last year than they did the previous season. Even with everything going in their favor health-wise, they barely stayed out of the play-in.</p>

<p>With a little bit of natural decline and regression to the mean in terms of injury luck, I think they’re in for a big fall this season. I actually think it’s more likely they fail to qualify for the play-in altogether than that they make the playoffs. I’d have them behind OKC, Minnesota, Denver, New Orleans, Dallas, Houston, Golden State, Memphis, the Lakers, and Sacramento. Roughly tied with the Clippers for 11th in the West.</p>

      <label for="lid5dm2" class="commentText"><p>Sure, they’re all very injury prone players. You wouldn’t expect them to. Here’s how many games Kevin Durant’s played each of the last 5 seasons:</p>

<p>Age 31: 0</p>

<p>Age 32: 35</p>

<p>Age 33: 55</p>

<p>Age 34: 47</p>

<p>Age 35: 75</p>

<p>Can you see why the last number might be a little unsustainably high? Beal’s 53 games played last year were his most since <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> and Booker’s 68 games played tied for the second most since <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub>. These guys are ALWAYS hurt. Last year was the best you could possibly hope for. Not to mention that Nurkic had the second healthiest season of his career as well.</p>

      <label for="lid7r1c" class="commentText"><p>Book rushed back from a groin injury in 2022 that caused him to miss a month and broke his wrist in 2017 but other than that his GP since 2016 were 78, 64, 70 (COVID season too!) 67, 67, 68. So that&rsquo;s two injuries over a 9 year career, and other than that he&rsquo;s been pretty healthy. Beal is what he is at this point, but part of the reason he missed so many games was because he tried rushing back at the beginning of the season before he was 100%, and that just set him back even longer.</p>

<p>Throwing in the 0 for KD while he rehabbed his torn achilles is crazy. He had two separate fluke injuries where someone fell into his leg and that&rsquo;s why he missed time the two seasons before. He&rsquo;s also been relatively healthy for most of his career, and I think he&rsquo;ll reach 65 game threshold again.</p>

<p>Also, why are we the only team that&rsquo;s gonna get bit by injuries? Zion played 70 games last year, Kawhi played 70 games last year, Bron and AD were healthy all last year, Steph played 74 games last year. You think all those things are going to happen again?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re also ignoring the fact that our roster is just a lot better than it was last year.</p>

<p>KCP gone, Murray on the downslide, and the Russ curse (post Kevin Durant, has Russ’ teams ever made it past the first round?)</p>

<p>Jokic’s finally gonna go from best player in the league to probably only top 3–5 which is enough to have the entire team underperform.  From rank 2 to rank 7-8 this year.</p>

      <label for="lid4pi6" class="commentText"><p>Knicks, I know they had a really solid season and probably would’ve gone to the finals this year had their team been healthy, but I feel it was really a one off. Losing IHart and keeping Julius, OG, and Mikal might create some weird dynamics I feel. I don’t think their role players will be able to play as well as they did this last season.</p>
