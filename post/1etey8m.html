      <p>Pick a team that is going to underperform based on their expectations. So you can pick a team that are seen as championship contenders and you see as an early playoff exit. Or a playoff team that you feel might even struggle to make the play in as well.</p>

<p>I feel like that team will be the grizzles tbh. The amount of people predicting them to be a top 3 seed to me. The west has gotten a lot better over the past two offseasons and I don’t see them coming back and going straight to the top of the conference just by getting their stars back. I think they will still be good but likely a play in team due to how great the conference is. What team do you think will underperform?</p>

      <label for="lidcir2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah if Kawhi only plays 50 games we are for sure in the play in spot and I don’t like our chances to make the playoffs. If he plays? I don’t really think our position in the standings changes much.</p>

<p>I don’t really think we belong in a discussion about ‘massively underperforming’ though. Clippers don’t have much expectations at all. A lot of people don’t expect us to even make a play in game. Which I would disagree with this is still a great team without PG we won’t miss him much until Kawhi goes down again</p>

      <label for="lictsu7" class="commentText"><p>I feel the opposite. I see so much about how they’re going to be out of the play-in without PG when the guy couldn’t even average 20 against Dallas with Kawhi out and was fouling non stop on defense.</p>

<p>They picked up a lot of good defenders like DJJ, Dunn and Batum to boost their defense and on offense Harden showed in the playoffs that he can still be an elite second option and Kawhi when he was healthy last season was still at minimum a top 10, if not top 5 player.</p>

<p>Plus Ty Lue always gets the most out of his teams as we saw for example in the 2021-22 season when PG missed over half the season and Kawhi was out entirely.</p>

<p>Also can’t underestimate the boost that new arena will give them.</p>

      <label for="licvsup" class="commentText"><p>I agree with some of what you said. When fully healthy the clippers are still a good team, especially defensively</p>

<p>I disagree with the PG point. Yes he was ass vs the Mavs but he was legitimately good in the regular season and the on/off numbers reflect that.</p>

<p>Also the Harden solo show doesn’t work anymore, so if Kawhi gets injured for any extended period of time they’re kinda cooked. He played the most he has since 2017, not sure if that’s gonna be replicated</p>

      <label for="lidr450" class="commentText"><p>You are only seeing that in some alternate fantasy world run by Clippers fans. Yeah PG has a spotty playoff record. But LAC got the healthiest/good years that Harden, Kawhi and PG have had in years and still only managed a four seed. The chances of Harden/Kawhi playing the same way next year are slim to none and you lost your third top line player.</p>

<p>DJJ/Dunn/Batum are bit players. None of them can carry an offensive load for 82 games. Harden got paid, so he&rsquo;s heading to a strip club. And Kawhi is gonna be back to being Kawhi.</p>

<p>If this team makes the top six, its gonna be a miracle.</p>

      <label for="lid208b" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m more in line with this. We saw the Clippers without Kawhi for a whole year who at the end of the season finished 7th/8th (?) and then missed the playoffs due to the play in tournament, where PG missed the 2nd game&hellip;</p>

<p>This was also with PG missing games here and there like he usually does. I don&rsquo;t expect Kawhi to be amazing, but he will still be on the team along with Harden.</p>

<p>I think we added much more versatility and depth to the roster, and overall seem more defensive minded than last. Biggest issue is once again not having a reliable back up big.</p>

Like out of those 3 teams, probably one gets lucky with health and makes the playoffs and whichever other two teams get less lucky are out.</p>

Thats what the Lakers got all excited about last year and most of their signings didn’t end up playing any meaningful minutes. Like it’s nice that you’re filling out the back end of your roster a little better, but it’s not going to make up for your 4 players that matter being likely to combine for about 60 games less this year than last year as they age and their health reverts to the mean.</p>

      <label for="lid7fke" class="commentText"><p>They should build a team that can take the burden off of Zion during the regular season. He can&rsquo;t carry them for an 82-game marathon. They should&rsquo;ve traded BI when he&rsquo;s of really high value. He&rsquo;s still a valuable asset that can help the right team but the Pels needs might not be completely satisfied from the returns.</p>

<p>If he can’t get himself in shape so he can be more durable then they need to move on to a new cornerstone.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t the Lakers/NY/Miami/GS, you need to build with what you have. Players don&rsquo;t want to go to NO. You draft, get the guy that can theoretically carry the team in the playoffs and build around that. You don&rsquo;t keep waiting until a top five guy falls in your lap.</p>

      <label for="lid8ika" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think Theis is as bad as you make it out to be, but as a Pels fan I am intrigued what the center rotation pre deadline will eventually be. From the little I know about the 4 of them, they seem to play different from eachother, and I am curious what sort of center will end up working best. Personally I have high hopes for Markovic, but that opinion is based on zero basketball knowledge, and some summer league</p>

<p>Nothing against Valanciunas, but he clearly wasn&rsquo;t working out with the coaching staff, and never really looked great next to Zion, so I&rsquo;m happy he went and got paid somewhere else.</p>

      <label for="lieown3" class="commentText"><p>I mean objectively he played more than 10-15 (it was 20-25) and also we had Nance to eat up minutes beyond him. Also Jonas was a MONSTER on the boards and was top 10 in the league in rebound percentage. He was also still 4th in the team in points despite being 5th in minutes played. Fact is, he will be missed in many ways, even if he wasn’t a good fit. But the way you paint him makes it seem like he didn’t have an impact which just isn’t true.</p>

<p>Edit I also just looked and he was top 20 in block percentage too, which is honestly surprising to me, but does show he had more of an impact on that front than you’re implying.</p>

<p>Year after year, the media hypes them up like they&rsquo;re gonna be strong contenders only for them to continuously never make it past the 2nd round. All I can do is roll my eyes at them hyping them up again even with PG there. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what pieces they have. Even if they can dominate other teams, they won&rsquo;t make it past the celtics. Celtics are their daddy.</p>

      <label for="licy67v" class="commentText"><p>I agree, but I believe the floor is the 6 seed which we saw jokic was capable of carrying us to without even having Jamal or mpj. In reality we will likely still be a top 4 seed but the question is whether we are a real contender which is where I have significant concern. </p>

Jokic doesn&rsquo;t have a big injury history, but we&rsquo;ve seen cases like this before: David Robinson getting injured in 1997 and Spurs go from a 2 seed in the West to 3rd worst team in the NBA. Nuggets, more than any other title contender, are 1 injury away from disaster.</p>

<p>I think most &ldquo;experts&rdquo; have us below Celtics, knicks, sixers bucks and in the same area as magic and cleveland and wherever you put the heat these days</p>

<p>which is a first round exit lol.</p>

<p>I think pacer fans are expecting more but the general nba internet fan is full bore on the &ldquo;we only made it out because of injuries&rdquo; adn expect us to be int he 6th seed range again and get bounced.</p>

<p>We could still &ldquo;improve&rdquo; but do worse int he playoffs pretty easily</p>

I personally am not sure if that would equate to another trip to the ECF or even the 2nd round but I’m rooting for the Pacers either way.</p>

<p>I’m excited to see more team defense and Mathurin in his third year. I think we overachieved last year on paper, we beat the teams we were expected to and lost to the ones we were expected to. This year is probably not “our year” but I know we can bloody the nose of any team in the leagues on any given night, and we’re gonna have some of the best games of the season.</p>

      <label for="lid4w0e" class="commentText"><p>I might have to disagree here. I know the Bucks have their fair share playoff disappointments and are primed to regress given their age but I think the talent and experience is too much assuming both teams are 100% healthy. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong though, I&rsquo;m definitely rooting for the Pacers over the Bucks like I did last year.</p>

Even if they don’t progress at all they should get better barring injury, and even with injury they could be better.</p>

      <label for="lieswvz" class="commentText"><p>We are a fantastic regular season team no matter what. Jenkins plays the starters less minutes than any other contending team out there. The Big 3 is young. Amazing transition offense. Two new young offensive geniuses in Iisalo and St. Andrews to help Jenkins out this year. The bench unit has players who are going to give it their all every night. You gotta remember we got those 2 two seeds even as an injured team. It wasn&rsquo;t like we had an all-time healthy szn like the Kings did in 22 or the Thunder did last season. Ja, Bane, and JJJ win games. I think people really downplay Bane and JJJ as stars. Bane was averaging Ant like stats on better shooting before he went down last season. He&rsquo;s legit one of the best shooters in the league. JJJ is a DPoY contender every year when he plays roaming PF which he couldn&rsquo;t last season (or at the end of 22 and playoffs) without Adams. We haven&rsquo;t seen him in that role in a long time, but when he&rsquo;s in it he&rsquo;s an actual defensive menace. Edey should definitely be able to fill in that Adams role so JJJ can go back to doing what he does best. When guys like VWJ, Smart, Clarke and Kennard are just complementary role players on a night-to-night basis you&rsquo;re in good shape.</p>

      <label for="lidj2n1" class="commentText"><p>Maybe the Rockets.  Their two stars are on contract years and one of them is kind of a chucker, and they both need the ball in their hands to do what they do best, they got a high drafted point guard who they want as their future, but they are paying their vet pg $44M.   Its kind of a crucial season.  Could add a lot of tension and &ldquo;over-playing&rdquo; by some guys.</p>

<p>I think what they have going for them is a tough coach who could help to keep the egos in line, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

Sure Ja will be back and he will be a difference maker, I like GG Jackson, and maybe moving JJJ to the de facto PF role will help him. But overall I&rsquo;m not expecting that much from them. They&rsquo;ll be back to being a playoff team, likely 5th or 6th seed, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all if they got bounced in the first round.</p>

      <label for="lif0axl" class="commentText"><p>Pacers. I’m seeing a lot of people high on them after their ECF run, but 6 of their 8 rotation playoff guys played 68+ regular season games, while Mathurin played 59 and Siakam 41 because he got there mid season. However with Haliburton not being the same after injury, they were about the same win rate as they were before the trade. I’m not sure how much they make a jump from 47 wins.</p>

<p>They didn’t really do much to change their roster from the playoffs and are banking on internal development and health (which they were fairly healthy last year) while the top of the East improved on paper. It’s unlikely they get a top 4 seed, and so they’ll probably have a first or second round matchup of Boston/NY/Philadelphia/Milwaukee, and if these teams are healthy, it’s not unreasonable that the Pacers might be a first round exit.</p>

<p>Milwaukee without Giannis took them 6, NY banged up took them 7, and Boston without Porzingis swept them, and the Sixers just swapped out Tobias Harris for Paul George. And this is without even considering if they can beat the Heat either, who are much more experienced. Yeah they didn’t have Mathurin, but I’m not sure they really closed the gap to be in that contender tier to make another deep run when none of these matchups feel favorable for them at full strength.</p>

<p>Unless the Pacers get an extremely favorable path, I could see them taking a step back while others might see their success last year and overrate how many games they’ll win during the regular season.</p>

<p>Oh and the Clippers. Clippers are going to be like the 12th seed.</p>

<p>I want to think grizzlies make a leap back up and move others down, even if it’s just to the 7th seed for Memphis</p>

      <label for="lieuhw4" class="commentText"><p>I think Edey was the only guy we could&rsquo;ve added this year that would fill the Adams role, and we did. He&rsquo;s one of the most dominant big men in NCAA history. If there&rsquo;s one thing that should transfer seamlessly from college to NBA it&rsquo;s his ability to rebound. He&rsquo;s still gonna be elite under the rim and he&rsquo;ll still be the biggest player on the floor at all times. Clarke is also back who missed the end of 22 and all of 23 (aside from like the last 6 games of the year) but he&rsquo;s also a decent rebounder and backup C that we just haven&rsquo;t had. I think Edey is in a perfect situation cuz he&rsquo;s not gonna be expected to do anything crazy. Just set screens and be ready for rebounds and put backs. Rebounding/turnovers/transition offense should all be right back where it was before Adams went down. Roaming PF JJJ is the best (aside from Wemby) stocks guy there is and Smart/Vince/Bane will be generating a lot of turnovers as well. Still got the high fliers in transition like Ja and Clarke too.</p>

      <label for="lieyyro" class="commentText"><p>Clippers unfortunately. They&rsquo;ve been bleeding out for awhile, but PG getting moved might&rsquo;ve been the nail in the coffin. Kawhi is still great no doubt about it, but you&rsquo;re gonna be asking a lot from him now, probably more than ever in his time on the Clippers.</p>

<p>Also I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ve really done all that much to improve their team to stand firm in the west either. Maybe they&rsquo;re fine with that, and possibly planning a Zombie Heat-esque season where they just gotta be good enough to make a 7th or 8th seed. But if I had to predict who the top seed west teams they&rsquo;d likely face (Mavs, OKC, or Wolves) I don&rsquo;t expect to see any Cinderella kinda run from them</p>

<p>I know and hear lots of glazing of LeBron and AD after the Olympics, saying they’re the best duo in the game still. They about to show everybody they’re not.</p>

<p><strong>Lakers are about to not make even the play-ins.</strong></p>

<p>And LeBron’s nepo circus with JJ and Bronny is going to be in full effect.</p>

      <label for="lidbjjv" class="commentText"><p>Wolves. Anything less than a finals appearance will seem like a disappointment. Especially with the situation around Towns and the team’s payroll. If he does his disappearing act again and they come up short because other teams have figured out Gobert it’s going to be a sad day. They’ll have to decide what to do with his 60 M and also figure out how much to pay Gobert in the future.</p>

They have neither of those, I think they will initially blitz the league just by ja morant comeback and soon teams will find out we don’t have to guard anyone else except for banes. Not to mention they don’t have any 6’6”-6’9” wing defender on their team. A lot of the podcasts say they are being forgotten and will do well but I think the grizzlies will</p>
