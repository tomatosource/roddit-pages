    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Pick a team that is going to underperform based on their expectations. So you can pick a team that are seen as championship contenders and you see as an early playoff exit. Or a playoff team that you feel might even struggle to make the play in as well.</p>

<p>I feel like that team will be the grizzles tbh. The amount of people predicting them to be a top 3 seed to me. The west has gotten a lot better over the past two offseasons and I don’t see them coming back and going straight to the top of the conference just by getting their stars back. I think they will still be good but likely a play in team due to how great the conference is. What team do you think will underperform?</p>

      <label for="licp9aa" class="commentText"><p>I am very worried about my Nuggets. Murray looks like he has lost two steps and has a long injury history. He was terrible in the playoffs but it was masked by his two gamer winners against the Lakers. He was even worse in the Olympics. KCP is gone, who was very important and underrated. MPJ cannot be counted on to be consistent. This is becoming a two man team with Jokic and Gordon. Murray is not the same guy.</p>

In reality we will likely still be a top 4 seed but the question is whether we are a real contender which is where I have significant concern. </p>

<p>Man was always gonna suck at the olympics and i dunno what people expected from that.</p>

<p>MPJ for sure, but the upside on him is the Lakers series and the downside is the Timberwolves series.</p>

<p>Also for all we know, Braun could really take a step forward and fill KCPs role.</p>

<p>Its not the end of the world, even if we do have some worries.</p>

      <label for="lictsu7" class="commentText"><p>I feel the opposite. I see so much about how they’re going to be out of the play-in without PG when the guy couldn’t even average 20 against Dallas with Kawhi out and was fouling non stop on defense.</p>

<p>They picked up a lot of good defenders like DJJ, Dunn and Batum to boost their defense and on offense Harden showed in the playoffs that he can still be an elite second option and Kawhi when he was healthy last season was still at minimum a top 10, if not top 5 player.</p>

<p>Plus Ty Lue always gets the most out of his teams as we saw for example in the 2021-22 season when PG missed over half the season and Kawhi was out entirely.</p>

<p>Also can’t underestimate the boost that new arena will give them.</p>

      <label for="licvsup" class="commentText"><p>I agree with some of what you said. When fully healthy the clippers are still a good team, especially defensively</p>

<p>I disagree with the PG point. Yes he was ass vs the Mavs but he was legitimately good in the regular season and the on/off numbers reflect that.</p>

<p>Also the Harden solo show doesn’t work anymore, so if Kawhi gets injured for any extended period of time they’re kinda cooked. He played the most he has since 2017, not sure if that’s gonna be replicated</p>

      <label for="lid208b" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m more in line with this. We saw the Clippers without Kawhi for a whole year who at the end of the season finished 7th/8th (?) and then missed the playoffs due to the play in tournament, where PG missed the 2nd game&hellip;</p>

<p>This was also with PG missing games here and there like he usually does. I don&rsquo;t expect Kawhi to be amazing, but he will still be on the team along with Harden.</p>

<p>I think we added much more versatility and depth to the roster, and overall seem more defensive minded than last. Biggest issue is once again not having a reliable back up big.</p>

Like out of those 3 teams, probably one gets lucky with health and makes the playoffs and whichever other two teams get less lucky are out.</p>

<p>OKC, Twolves, Denver, Kings, Dallas, Grizzlies have Top 6 on lock.</p>

<p>Pels have Big 3 Zion, BI, DeJounte. Spurs added CP3 and Barnes to a 2nd year Victor.</p>

<p>I have them 9 onwards and PHX is definitely the best of the 3. Just added Tyus Jones and the role players are much better. That leaves Clippers vs Lakers and my money is on the Clippers cause they finished much higher this yr.</p>

<p>Leonard not at the Olympics is also a blessing in disguise cause Bron and AD would be tired first 30 games like Austin after FIBA and Bron is already a known coaster.</p>

<p>Gonna have to blow it up soon. I know it’s hard to say this about a play in team but I don’t expect to see Trae on the team in 2026</p>

Trae is gone sooner than later. Just not sure how much teams would be willing to give up. He needs the perfect roster (always thought Miami &amp; Spo could use him really well/cover up the defense).</p>

If he’s your number 2 guy then that’s fantastic. He’s shown he can be a number 1 guy on a almost contender with only pretty good talent around him.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of the top five offensive players in the league.  He 100% does not just dribble around and throw it to guys at the last second.  He&rsquo;s one of the best playmakers EVER, not just in the league.</p>

<p>The Nuggets won a championship with someone like Jamal Murray handling the ball 8 minutes a game in the playoffs which was far more than Jokic and fourth in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Year after year, the media hypes them up like they&rsquo;re gonna be strong contenders only for them to continuously never make it past the 2nd round. All I can do is roll my eyes at them hyping them up again even with PG there. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what pieces they have. Even if they can dominate other teams, they won&rsquo;t make it past the celtics. Celtics are their daddy.</p>

<p>It’s very obvious by watching and looking at stats (something you and your fanbase do all day) that he struggles against the bucks.</p>

      <label for="licrna7" class="commentText"><p>Old doesn’t mean anything especially when it’s mainly just Lopez.</p>

<p>The bucks problem has been injuries and manly Giannis and Middleton and they aren’t old just freak injuries.</p>

<p>If we lose early on it won’t be because of being old.</p>

<p>They had the best defense, net rating and 3rd ranked offensive starting 5 in the league. All they need is Giannis/Dame to get chemistry and stay healthy.</p>

      <label for="licw9ow" class="commentText"><p>He didn’t have a down year? Lmao he went from a first option to a second option while on a new team and dealing with divorce yet he still put up 25 ppg on 59% TS</p>

<p>When he got back in his role (with giannis out) as a number option he averaged 30/4/8 63% TS</p>

<p>Then playoffs he averaged 31/3/5 64% Ts</p>

<p>If that’s a down year then idk what to tell you. Yes he’s older but he doesn’t have an injury history aside from the abdominal stuff years ago. If Steph can still play at a high level at 36 then why can’t Dame?</p>

<p>like I said above, health and giannis/dame chemistry is what bucks need to worry about.</p>

<p>Edit: not to mention he admitted that Griffin was running 0 plays for him which is another reason he struggled</p>

<p>The only injures he had was the knee and wrist. The ankle injury that cause him to miss so much last season was cause KD undercut him. Iirc before and after that he was healthy</p>

<p>Either way, we just seen what he’s still capable of in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Age is not the bucks problem, it’s health. Which is what I was getting at</p>

DJM-herb-trey-zion with CJ off the bench is a better squad than last year, but BI clogs the wing rotation and takes more valuable touches away from DJM and zion. having to start either missi or theis is also near malpractice - if the deadline doesnt involve some major moves i think that team is cooked</p>

From the little I know about the 4 of them, they seem to play different from eachother, and I am curious what sort of center will end up working best. Personally I have high hopes for Markovic, but that opinion is based on zero basketball knowledge, and some summer league</p>

That was the same year that Sacramento was a 3 seed, and then the next season that same team was the 9 seed despite finishing with a relatively similar record.</p>

<p>The west wasn&rsquo;t a joke that year from a talent standpoint, but from a record standpoint it kinda was.</p>

<p>The Kings had a crazy combination of injury luck and close game luck iirc. Meanwhile the Nuggets and Clippers won even more games last year than the year before with the same roster.</p>

<p>The west also wasn’t bad in 2021-2022 when our baby team did it, too.</p>

<p>Some people here and there may be saying that the grizzlies are a possible top three seed, but that’s not the general expectation. Their general expectation is more like a  6-9 seed, in other words similar to the OP’s expectations.</p>

Booker and Beal both played more games last year than they did the previous season. Even with everything going in their favor health-wise, they barely stayed out of the play-in.</p>

<p>With a little bit of natural decline and regression to the mean in terms of injury luck, I think they’re in for a big fall this season. I actually think it’s more likely they fail to qualify for the play-in altogether than that they make the playoffs. I’d have them behind OKC, Minnesota, Denver, New Orleans, Dallas, Houston, Golden State, Memphis, the Lakers, and Sacramento. Roughly tied with the Clippers for 11th in the West.</p>

      <label for="lid5dm2" class="commentText"><p>Sure, they’re all very injury prone players. You wouldn’t expect them to. Here’s how many games Kevin Durant’s played each of the last 5 seasons:</p>

<p>Age 31: 0</p>

<p>Age 32: 35</p>

<p>Age 33: 55</p>

<p>Age 34: 47</p>

<p>Age 35: 75</p>

<p>Can you see why the last number might be a little unsustainably high? Beal’s 53 games played last year were his most since <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> and Booker’s 68 games played tied for the second most since <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub>. These guys are ALWAYS hurt. Last year was the best you could possibly hope for. Not to mention that Nurkic had the second healthiest season of his career as well.</p>

      <label for="lid7r1c" class="commentText"><p>Book rushed back from a groin injury in 2022 that caused him to miss a month and broke his wrist in 2017 but other than that his GP since 2016 were 78, 64, 70 (COVID season too!) 67, 67, 68. So that&rsquo;s two injuries over a 9 year career, and other than that he&rsquo;s been pretty healthy. Beal is what he is at this point, but part of the reason he missed so many games was because he tried rushing back at the beginning of the season before he was 100%, and that just set him back even longer.</p>

<p>Throwing in the 0 for KD while he rehabbed his torn achilles is crazy. He had two separate fluke injuries where someone fell into his leg and that&rsquo;s why he missed time the two seasons before. He&rsquo;s also been relatively healthy for most of his career, and I think he&rsquo;ll reach 65 game threshold again.</p>

<p>Also, why are we the only team that&rsquo;s gonna get bit by injuries? Zion played 70 games last year, Kawhi played 70 games last year, Bron and AD were healthy all last year, Steph played 74 games last year. You think all those things are going to happen again?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re also ignoring the fact that our roster is just a lot better than it was last year.</p>

<p>Denver - 52.5: just ask the Warriors how multiple long playoff runs can eventually wear on the body. The loss of KCP is bigger than most realize, Murray and MPJ&rsquo;s injury history raise concerns. But the Joker might be the new Duncana re: forcing his team to 50 wins.</p>

<p>Memphis - 46.5: I get that the young talent on this team is stout and has great chemistry, but asking them to hop right back into the thick of the Western Conference after a trying year is a tall task. I&rsquo;m not nearly as bullish on this team as most seem to be</p>

<p>Warriors- 43.5: to my memory, the last time that Steph Curry was the only + player in the lineup, this team was drafting 2nd overall the following spring. All that has happened since then is Draymond is older and less efficient instead of injured, Klay is gone instead of injured and Wiggins production has plummeted. This Win total seems to be inflated by the prospect of a potential Lauri Markkanen trade but even then, is that two man game enough to make the play-in out West?</p>

<p>San Antonio - 35.5: another year of development for Wemby cannot be overstated. He&rsquo;s going to be a phenomenal star for as long as the fates allow. And I wish him all the best. But is a CP3/Wemby PnR really enough to elevate this team to 35 wins? I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised by another season of sparkling Wemby stat lines en route to a 25-57 record.</p>

      <label for="lid4pi6" class="commentText"><p>Knicks, I know they had a really solid season and probably would’ve gone to the finals this year had their team been healthy, but I feel it was really a one off. Losing IHart and keeping Julius, OG, and Mikal might create some weird dynamics I feel. I don’t think their role players will be able to play as well as they did this last season.</p>
