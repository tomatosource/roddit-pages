      <label for="lji5xkf" class="commentText"><p>That’s an amazingly beautiful story. I think hearing stories like these I get back to the fact that Pop would have probably retired had his wife not passed away. I may be wrong but I think getting lost in one’s job is one way of escaping.</p>

<p>Also, why did Kawhi leave again? Was it the San Antonio or bad treatment of him and his family by Pop? Did we ever find out?</p>

<p>I can give you the play-by-play of what was reported in the media, if you want to know, but I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s what you were asking for.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="ljiegh2" class="commentText"><p>My recollection of what we know as the public (and my, obviously biased, view as a long-time Spurs fan):</p>

<p>Up until the Zaza incident, Kawhi was the heir apparent to Timmy. The quiet, 2-way superstar who played the right way and had developed what was in incredibly raw offensive game coming into the league to being a top 3 player in the league. (There can be arguments about how much of Kawhi&rsquo;s developed was helped by being with Pop and the Spurs development team, and how much was he hindered by playing within that system, but the results kind of speak for themselves).</p>

<p>Then he got injured. Everything after that gets murky.</p>

<ul>
<li>We know that he took time away from SA and the team. He was rarely around the team, and when he was, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of communication. He skipped out of town for the majority of the season and wasn&rsquo;t anywhere to be seen in the playoffs.</li>
<li>There was reportedly some disagreement about his injury recovery. As a long-time Spurs fan this has never made a lot of sense to me. This is an organisation that ALWAYS prioritised long term health of it&rsquo;s players over short-term wins. Pop has always been notorious for limiting guys minutes. Pop had made the decision to not let a peak Tim Duncan play in the &lsquo;00 playoffs when he was apparently fit to do so. It would be very out of character  for the Spurs to be forcing Kawhi to play if he wasn&rsquo;t fit.</li>
<li>Kawhi, reportedly, had his own doctors who had a different opinion to the Spurs medical staff, but also (reportedly) wasn&rsquo;t having any communication with the Spurs organisation. The famous report (im pretty sure from Rachel Nichols) was that the Spurs tried to meet him in New York and he literally hid from them.</li>
<li>There was the famous comment from Tony about &ldquo;I&rsquo;m older and have recovered from the same injury&rdquo;, and repeated responses by other Spurs vets of &ldquo;Ask Kawhi&rdquo; every time the media asked them where he was and when he was returning. Stephen Jackson will point to the Tony thing as the reason for Kawhi leaving, but I recall it happening after the New York stuff, and definitely after Kawhi had also spend a long time away from the team.</li>
<li>In hindsight it is obvious that the go-home factor was a part of this (possibly the biggest part), but we don&rsquo;t know if/when/how that was ever communicated to the team.</li>
<li>But in all this time, I don&rsquo;t think Kawhi ever actually requested a trade, (or it wasn&rsquo;t publicised), at least not until the offseason when he only had a year left. I believe the Spurs had put a max extension offer on the table for him (which I recall had been pulled by this stage), but the rumour was that he/agent (uncle) where unhappy either that the offer came too late, or were unhappy with his previous rookie extension (which remember was when he was still before his huge offensive breakout).</li>
<li>If Kawhi had actually requested a trade before the &lsquo;18 trade deadline, then I don&rsquo;t think most Spurs fans would have that big of a problem with him. At that stage, as a top-3 player in the league who was looking ready to come back from injury, you are probably getting AD-like trade returns. Players leave, and you would get upset, but you would get a trade return that actually reflects his worth.</li>
<li>Instead nothing happens until the end of the season, nobody knows where he&rsquo;s at mentally or physically, no-one wants to overpay for a guy who not only might leave in a year but might not actually show up (Windhorst actually reported this), and (my guess is that) the Lakers were so sure that he was coming in free agency that they tried to low-ball the Spurs (the biggest offer I have seen actually reported from LA was Ingram, Kuz and a First - <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38090407/western-conference-nba-biggest-ifs-five-years" target="_blank">Western Conference - NBA&rsquo;s biggest what-ifs of the past five years - ESPN</a>&hellip; so they lost out on Kawhi the same way the lost out on PG the year before. Probably why they finally pulled the trigger on the AD trade instead of waiting for free agency).  Instead the Spurs went with the Toronto offer, which from quick summary they have been able to turn into something like 5 FRP&rsquo;s (which I think is more than you would get from that LA package).</li>
<li>How much of this was actually about the injury? How much was about the personalities involved and feelings of mistreatment? And how much was truly about just wanting to go home and be with his family (my gut is that it is all about this - and I have consistently said that I have no problem with Kawhi making that decision. I just think there better ways for that to happen). If he had made a trade request earlier, and/or told the Spurs that he wanted to go home a year earlier and the team didn&rsquo;t look at trades then - well then that&rsquo;s on the team.</li>

<p>You think a guy who would sit and cry in a room with DRoz for 2 hours would be callous about the team doctors telling a superstar &ldquo;yeh your knee is fucked for life, get the fuck back here and start playing?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Tony said he came back from a much more severe quad injury and you just have to stay positive going through the long rehab.</p>

<p>Which is all 100% true.</p>

<p>Also, the Spurs didn&rsquo;t say his leg was fucked and he should come back and play. The major disagreement was the Spurs wanted to rule Kawhi out for the entire season but Kawhi and his camp didn&rsquo;t want that because they didn&rsquo;t want Kawhi labeled as an injury risk before he got a new contract.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crazy that we&rsquo;ve now had 5 years of Kawhi being too injury prone to be valuable and 5 years of being a shitty teammate and people still act like they have no idea what side to believe.</p>

<p>why do people guess at this stuff when we can literally go back and see the quote</p>

<p>Brother. You can&rsquo;t say your injury was &ldquo;100x times worse&rdquo; than a teammate. You have to remember he also followed it up with a comment about Kawhi getting his own doctors</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I could have gone anywhere, but I trust my Spurs doctors. They have been with me my whole career. They know my body better than anybody…I feel like we have the best medical team in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody at the time, including presumably Kawhi, took it as direct shade. Tim Duncan would have never made a comment like that lol.</p>

      <label for="ljjtj90" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi was diagnosed with quad tendinopathy while Tony ruptured his whole quad tendon (at 35 no less, at his age and based on his playstyle I’d honestly thought Parker would have to retire after that injury). Parker’s quote, in context, meant something to the effect of “I’m an old man and have dealt with an injury that’s more severe to the same part of my body but was able to come back from it, Kawhi’s gonna be fine he just has to trust the rehab and he’ll be back to normal in no time.” If you watch the clip, Parker clearly meant nothing malicious by it</p>

      <label for="ljjx1wk" class="commentText"><p>The team let him have all the time in the world, kawhi was cleared to play his last season with the spurs but wouldn’t get on the court. But his thigh issue is ongoing and will be an issue for the rest of his career.
The context for Tony Parker’s quote was Tony had a complete tear in his quadriceps and fully recovered with the spurs medical staff. Kawhi had a bruise in his quadriceps and choose to go elsewhere because he didn’t like hearing that it was degenerative.</p>

<p>The full story: Tony Parker on his return from the career-threatening quad injury he suffered last May: I’ve been through it. It was a rehab for me for eight months. Same kind of injury (as Kawhi), but mine was a hundred times worse. But the same kind of injury. You just stay positive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tony also said he never considered getting a second-opinion after he tore his quad: &ldquo;I could have gone anywhere, but I trust my Spurs doctors. They have been with me my whole career. They know my body better than anybody…I feel like we have the best medical team in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tony Parker’s injury was worse. He trusted the team doctors and got better. He was imploring kawhi to do the same.</p>

      <label for="ljiwlqq" class="commentText"><p>Thank you for such a great summary!</p>

<p>I am also a Spurs fan and thus biased. What jumps out to me is that Kawhi seems to have had a very very bad injury history and I am not sure if doing it on his own helped his longevity. This is of course pure speculation and his knees might have gone either way, but to not trust the org who had a myriad of injury prone players and yet still helped them play for a long time. Idk… I guess I am still sour even if the Raptors run was great and I was rooting for them.</p>

<p>On a side note - I trust nothing that S Jackson is spewing. The man is bitter and pure poison.</p>

<p>On another note - Murray wanted to leave to. It did not get better for him. At least Kawhi has a ring to show for leaving (although not to his preferred destination right away). I would not want Dejounte with Wemby, even though 2 years ago that might have seemed like a dream combo.</p>

      <label for="ljj06os" class="commentText"><p>I think this was exactly the issue.  Spurs knew the guy needed care, but Kawhi wanted to treat his injuries his own way.  You don&rsquo;t hear anything about Kawhi refusing to work with team medical staff with his teams now, so to the extent this is accurate this might have been a phase he and his ppl went through at that particular time which helped cause the rift.</p>

<p>I think the Spurs, essentially, recognized Kawhi as damaged goods and wanted that to be taken into consideration for his next contract. Kawhi wanted it to be just a regular injury that would heal completely and not cause future problems.</p>

<p>We traded DJ for the same reason we traded DW and Poeltl. We were a middling team that wasn&rsquo;t going in either direction, and when a good enough offer was on the table we thought it was the right decision to move them and to properly rebuild.</p>

<p>Any comments that DJ makes on Twitter need to be balanced by what we know about him as a person and the kind of &lsquo;trauma&rsquo; he grew up around. My guess is that if DJ doesn&rsquo;t develop that me-against-the-world, giant chip on the shoulder, type of personality, he would never even have gotten close to the NBA. Unfortunately there is the emotional stuff that comes with out, but the guy has talked about loving Pop and SA - which is probably part of why he took it so personal when he got traded.</p>

      <label for="ljjepnu" class="commentText"><p>Great recap, I would add just one thing, which is that the Spurs didn’t give Kawhi the max rookie extension immediately, which then allowed them to sign Lamarcus Aldridge into cap space. </p>

<p>At the time Kawhi says he understood the rationale but I think this eventually got spun by his camp into the Spurs not believing in him: <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-spurs-annoyed-some-in-kawhi-leonards-camp-by-not-giving-him-2014-contract-extension" target="_blank">https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-spurs-annoyed-some-in-kawhi-leonards-camp-by-not-giving-him-2014-contract-extension</a></p>

      <label for="ljjpgj1" class="commentText"><p>I believe his uncle became more involved around this time as well. They&rsquo;ve known that he&rsquo;s had a degenerative knee issue all this time. Leonard should be saluted for playing through it the way that he has. It&rsquo;s remarkable (and fortunate) that he even won in Toronto.</p>

<p>It was the silence around his situation that caused the many rifts. If he acknowledges the knee issues, he may not get the payday(s) he wanted and eventually receives. But in keeping quiet and spending time away from your team (also letting your uncle do the talking on your behalf) just made it seem like you didn&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>

      <label for="ljju0r4" class="commentText"><p>I agree that at the end of the day he just wanted to make the move for personal reasons and family. The Spurs are a great organization but he wasn’t going to rearrange his entire life for his job he wanted the job to serve his personal life. In any other industry this wouldn’t even be a discussion point but people gotta take it personally in sports when there city/team gets “rejected” by a player.</p>

      <label for="ljjzvjt" class="commentText"><p>Hindsight&rsquo;s <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>, but I think it was just combo of his wanting to play closer to home and his continued lack of interest in communicating anything personal at all to employers.  I think the Spurs could have found a doctor to agree with Kawhi and it would have changed nothing unless the franchise relocated to San Diego.</p>

<p>And ultimately, I think the real problem for the Spurs was Kawhi&rsquo;s desire being to play only on teams that were direct conference rivals made it extremely difficult to find a trade partner.</p>

<p>The Spurs are clowned for that being a one-sided trade, but there is no evidence of there actually being anything better on the table.</p>

<p>So either you I think it was actually a good trade for the Spurs, OR you think that teams weren&rsquo;t offering full value for Kawhi (and have to accept there were reasons for this)? Which is it?</p>

In the end what actually led to the departure was Kawhi wanted the max but the spurs, who had been trying to communicate with him about how he was progressing for months, weren&rsquo;t confident about giving him that much money if the dude was gonna pull the same stunt and basically ghost the team again. They still didn&rsquo;t even get an update when pop talked to kawhi, there was also rumors coming out about the spurs, that doesn&rsquo;t happen ever even for spurs fans. So it was assumed someone was leaking stuff to the media, pop meeting with kawhi was also supposed to be a secret. Not even an hour passes before a picture of pop and kawhi eating at a near completely empty restaurant appears on the internet</p>

      <label for="ljjrsdg" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi just wanted to go home to LA. It’s not really that complicated. Spurs docs basically gave him a career-ending diagnosis in <sup>2017</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> that turned out to be correct, but he didn’t want to hear it, so things got strained, and he wanted out and wanted to go home.</p>

<p>It was a shit situation and he would have left well over $100 mil on the table if he had accepted the diagnosis and gone the full conservative route the Spurs wanted him to. So even tho I hated how it played out, I can’t say I would have done any different in his shoes.</p>

There&rsquo;s life and there&rsquo;s baseball, and one helps you get through the other.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not a baseball fan, replace it with Lakers, and hopefully good times with basketball help you though bad times in life and good memories in life help you through Darvin Ham </p>
