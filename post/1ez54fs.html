      <label for="ljldf6k" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d love to see him get a ring too. It&rsquo;s a shame that his game coincided with the rise of the 3 ball. Feels like he would have been an even bigger star in the 90&rsquo;s or 00&rsquo;s. Midrange specialist guards like him are still great but with the game evolving around the 3 point shot it feels like unless you&rsquo;re a 40% or near 40% 3 point shooter you&rsquo;re not going to be pursued as a valuable championship piece, regardless of how well you do other things.</p>

<p>Also, why did Kawhi leave again? Was it the San Antonio or bad treatment of him and his family by Pop? Did we ever find out?</p>

      </div>
      <label for="ljiegh2" class="commentText"><p>My recollection of what we know as the public (and my, obviously biased, view as a long-time Spurs fan):</p>

<p>Up until the Zaza incident, Kawhi was the heir apparent to Timmy. The quiet, 2-way superstar who played the right way and had developed what was in incredibly raw offensive game coming into the league to being a top 3 player in the league. (There can be arguments about how much of Kawhi&rsquo;s developed was helped by being with Pop and the Spurs development team, and how much was he hindered by playing within that system, but the results kind of speak for themselves).</p>

<p>Then he got injured. Everything after that gets murky.</p>

<ul>
<li>We know that he took time away from SA and the team. He was rarely around the team, and when he was, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of communication. He skipped out of town for the majority of the season and wasn&rsquo;t anywhere to be seen in the playoffs.</li>
<li>There was reportedly some disagreement about his injury recovery. As a long-time Spurs fan this has never made a lot of sense to me. This is an organisation that ALWAYS prioritised long term health of it&rsquo;s players over short-term wins. Pop has always been notorious for limiting guys minutes. Pop had made the decision to not let a peak Tim Duncan play in the &lsquo;00 playoffs when he was apparently fit to do so. It would be very out of character  for the Spurs to be forcing Kawhi to play if he wasn&rsquo;t fit.</li>
<li>Kawhi, reportedly, had his own doctors who had a different opinion to the Spurs medical staff, but also (reportedly) wasn&rsquo;t having any communication with the Spurs organisation. The famous report (im pretty sure from Rachel Nichols) was that the Spurs tried to meet him in New York and he literally hid from them.</li>
<li>There was the famous comment from Tony about &ldquo;I&rsquo;m older and have recovered from the same injury&rdquo;, and repeated responses by other Spurs vets of &ldquo;Ask Kawhi&rdquo; every time the media asked them where he was and when he was returning. Stephen Jackson will point to the Tony thing as the reason for Kawhi leaving, but I recall it happening after the New York stuff, and definitely after Kawhi had also spend a long time away from the team.</li>
<li>In hindsight it is obvious that the go-home factor was a part of this (possibly the biggest part), but we don&rsquo;t know if/when/how that was ever communicated to the team.</li>
<li>But in all this time, I don&rsquo;t think Kawhi ever actually requested a trade, (or it wasn&rsquo;t publicised), at least not until the offseason when he only had a year left. I believe the Spurs had put a max extension offer on the table for him (which I recall had been pulled by this stage), but the rumour was that he/agent (uncle) where unhappy either that the offer came too late, or were unhappy with his previous rookie extension (which remember was when he was still before his huge offensive breakout).</li>
<li>If Kawhi had actually requested a trade before the &lsquo;18 trade deadline, then I don&rsquo;t think most Spurs fans would have that big of a problem with him. At that stage, as a top-3 player in the league who was looking ready to come back from injury, you are probably getting AD-like trade returns. Players leave, and you would get upset, but you would get a trade return that actually reflects his worth.</li>
<li>Instead nothing happens until the end of the season, nobody knows where he&rsquo;s at mentally or physically, no-one wants to overpay for a guy who not only might leave in a year but might not actually show up (Windhorst actually reported this), and (my guess is that) the Lakers were so sure that he was coming in free agency that they tried to low-ball the Spurs (the biggest offer I have seen actually reported from LA was Ingram, Kuz and a First - <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38090407/western-conference-nba-biggest-ifs-five-years" target="_blank">Western Conference - NBA&rsquo;s biggest what-ifs of the past five years - ESPN</a>&hellip; so they lost out on Kawhi the same way the lost out on PG the year before. Probably why they finally pulled the trigger on the AD trade instead of waiting for free agency).  Instead the Spurs went with the Toronto offer, which from quick summary they have been able to turn into something like 5 FRP&rsquo;s (which I think is more than you would get from that LA package).</li>
<li>How much of this was actually about the injury? How much was about the personalities involved and feelings of mistreatment? And how much was truly about just wanting to go home and be with his family (my gut is that it is all about this - and I have consistently said that I have no problem with Kawhi making that decision. I just think there better ways for that to happen). If he had made a trade request earlier, and/or told the Spurs that he wanted to go home a year earlier and the team didn&rsquo;t look at trades then - well then that&rsquo;s on the team.</li>

Kawhi tried to find his own doctor that gave him a different diagnosis.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with getting a second opinion, but clearly the spurs drs were correct.</p>

<p>You think a guy who would sit and cry in a room with DRoz for 2 hours would be callous about the team doctors telling a superstar &ldquo;yeh your knee is fucked for life, get the fuck back here and start playing?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Most teams would be like, yeh bro, take some time off and get your head right before you come back.  If that was the case.</p>

<p>Tony said he came back from a much more severe quad injury and you just have to stay positive going through the long rehab.</p>

<p>Which is all 100% true.</p>

<p>Also, the Spurs didn&rsquo;t say his leg was fucked and he should come back and play. The major disagreement was the Spurs wanted to rule Kawhi out for the entire season but Kawhi and his camp didn&rsquo;t want that because they didn&rsquo;t want Kawhi labeled as an injury risk before he got a new contract.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crazy that we&rsquo;ve now had 5 years of Kawhi being too injury prone to be valuable and 5 years of being a shitty teammate and people still act like they have no idea what side to believe.</p>

<p>why do people guess at this stuff when we can literally go back and see the quote</p>

<p>I’ve been through it. It was a rehab for me for eight months. Same kind of injury (as Kawhi), but mine was a hundred times worse. But the same kind of injury. You just stay positive.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brother. You can&rsquo;t say your injury was &ldquo;100x times worse&rdquo; than a teammate. You have to remember he also followed it up with a comment about Kawhi getting his own doctors</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I could have gone anywhere, but I trust my Spurs doctors. They have been with me my whole career. They know my body better than anybody…I feel like we have the best medical team in the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everybody at the time, including presumably Kawhi, took it as direct shade. Tim Duncan would have never made a comment like that lol.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kens5.com/video/sports/nba/spurs/tony-parker-talks-about-kawhi-leonards-injury/273-8045285" target="_blank">2:35 in the video</a></p>

<p>The question is a message for Kawhi and Tony says that he needs to stay positive 3x. The 100x worse part is just in the moment hyperbole.</p>

<p>People seemingly don&rsquo;t want to believe Kawhi just wanted to live in LA. Everybody wants to frame it as the Spurs must&rsquo;ve done something to screw it up when Kawhi just wanted to find a way to go home and not be the bad guy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious after what happened in Toronto. They gave in to every one of Kawhi&rsquo;s demands, they treated him with the softest kid gloves, surrounded him with great talent and won a title. They did literally everything a franchise could do to appease a superstar and Kawhi still said &ldquo;fuck that I&rsquo;m going to LA.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="ljjtj90" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi was diagnosed with quad tendinopathy while Tony ruptured his whole quad tendon (at 35 no less, at his age and based on his playstyle I’d honestly thought Parker would have to retire after that injury). Parker’s quote, in context, meant something to the effect of “I’m an old man and have dealt with an injury that’s more severe to the same part of my body but was able to come back from it, Kawhi’s gonna be fine he just has to trust the rehab and he’ll be back to normal in no time.” If you watch the clip, Parker clearly meant nothing malicious by it</p>

      <label for="ljjx1wk" class="commentText"><p>The team let him have all the time in the world, kawhi was cleared to play his last season with the spurs but wouldn’t get on the court. But his thigh issue is ongoing and will be an issue for the rest of his career.
The context for Tony Parker’s quote was Tony had a complete tear in his quadriceps and fully recovered with the spurs medical staff. Kawhi had a bruise in his quadriceps and choose to go elsewhere because he didn’t like hearing that it was degenerative.</p>

<p>The full story: Tony Parker on his return from the career-threatening quad injury he suffered last May: I’ve been through it. It was a rehab for me for eight months. Same kind of injury (as Kawhi), but mine was a hundred times worse. But the same kind of injury. You just stay positive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tony also said he never considered getting a second-opinion after he tore his quad: &ldquo;I could have gone anywhere, but I trust my Spurs doctors. They have been with me my whole career. They know my body better than anybody…I feel like we have the best medical team in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tony Parker’s injury was worse. He trusted the team doctors and got better. He was imploring kawhi to do the same.</p>

      <label for="ljiwlqq" class="commentText"><p>Thank you for such a great summary!</p>

<p>I am also a Spurs fan and thus biased. What jumps out to me is that Kawhi seems to have had a very very bad injury history and I am not sure if doing it on his own helped his longevity. This is of course pure speculation and his knees might have gone either way, but to not trust the org who had a myriad of injury prone players and yet still helped them play for a long time. Idk… I guess I am still sour even if the Raptors run was great and I was rooting for them.</p>

<p>On a side note - I trust nothing that S Jackson is spewing. The man is bitter and pure poison.</p>

<p>On another note - Murray wanted to leave to. It did not get better for him. At least Kawhi has a ring to show for leaving (although not to his preferred destination right away). I would not want Dejounte with Wemby, even though 2 years ago that might have seemed like a dream combo.</p>

      <label for="ljj06os" class="commentText"><p>I think this was exactly the issue.  Spurs knew the guy needed care, but Kawhi wanted to treat his injuries his own way.  You don&rsquo;t hear anything about Kawhi refusing to work with team medical staff with his teams now, so to the extent this is accurate this might have been a phase he and his ppl went through at that particular time which helped cause the rift.</p>

<p>I think the Spurs, essentially, recognized Kawhi as damaged goods and wanted that to be taken into consideration for his next contract. Kawhi wanted it to be just a regular injury that would heal completely and not cause future problems.</p>

<p>We traded DJ for the same reason we traded DW and Poeltl. We were a middling team that wasn&rsquo;t going in either direction, and when a good enough offer was on the table we thought it was the right decision to move them and to properly rebuild.</p>

<p>Any comments that DJ makes on Twitter need to be balanced by what we know about him as a person and the kind of &lsquo;trauma&rsquo; he grew up around. My guess is that if DJ doesn&rsquo;t develop that me-against-the-world, giant chip on the shoulder, type of personality, he would never even have gotten close to the NBA. Unfortunately there is the emotional stuff that comes with out, but the guy has talked about loving Pop and SA - which is probably part of why he took it so personal when he got traded.</p>

<p>At the time Kawhi says he understood the rationale but I think this eventually got spun by his camp into the Spurs not believing in him: <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-spurs-annoyed-some-in-kawhi-leonards-camp-by-not-giving-him-2014-contract-extension" target="_blank">https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-spurs-annoyed-some-in-kawhi-leonards-camp-by-not-giving-him-2014-contract-extension</a></p>

Leonard should be saluted for playing through it the way that he has. It&rsquo;s remarkable (and fortunate) that he even won in Toronto.</p>

<p>It was the silence around his situation that caused the many rifts. If he acknowledges the knee issues, he may not get the payday(s) he wanted and eventually receives. But in keeping quiet and spending time away from your team (also letting your uncle do the talking on your behalf) just made it seem like you didn&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>

I think the Spurs could have found a doctor to agree with Kawhi and it would have changed nothing unless the franchise relocated to San Diego.</p>

<p>And ultimately, I think the real problem for the Spurs was Kawhi&rsquo;s desire being to play only on teams that were direct conference rivals made it extremely difficult to find a trade partner.</p>

      <label for="ljk94se" class="commentText"><p>There is alot of additional, speculative tidbits surrounding this whole mess. Like having a beef with LMA, not resigning Simmons, the way the vets still &ldquo;ran&rdquo; the team and were treated like royalty in San Antonio, etc.</p>

<p>Not everyone is cut our for it or feels comfortable with it. I&rsquo;m certainly glad he doesn&rsquo;t act out the same way Stephen Jackson does because Leonard is clear a significantly more important player to the league and fans and it would be a much bigger drama storm (or have been, only so much to it, I guess) but it leaves alot of people terribly curious just WTF was going on.</p>

<p>I think it was cumulative. Ultimately, he wanted to go home to SoCal, but if things had gone better in SA, he would not have done what he did. Personally, I think the beef with LMA was a big deal and a persistent rumor was that Leonard&rsquo;s &lsquo;team&rsquo; wanted a say in personnel decisions - wanted the Spurs to pursue a trade for a younger, more complimentary star to go along with their guy. The Spurs do Spurs things like going our and getting ancient Pau Gasol, David Lee, dudes like that.</p>

<p>Correct, we&rsquo;ll never know. I can accept a player not wanting to remain with a team and go somewhere else, its part of the deal - you just hate it when it happens to your team. The way this all went down is what will always bother Spurs fans.</p>

<p>If he put his hand up after the Zaza injury and said - I wanna go home to LA, trade me know or I walk in 2 years, and if either the Lakers or Clippers them actually offered fair trade value, and/or if another team offered better value for a top 3 player with 18-24 months on his contract, then everyone would get over the initial upset and move on with the fair trade return.</p>

<p>The problem is that he spent a year tanking his trade value.</p>

<p>Remember - a year later the Lakers offer for AD (with a year left on his contract) was around 3 times their reported offer for Kawhi.</p>

      <label for="ljjrsdg" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi just wanted to go home to LA. It’s not really that complicated. Spurs docs basically gave him a career-ending diagnosis in <sup>2017</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> that turned out to be correct, but he didn’t want to hear it, so things got strained, and he wanted out and wanted to go home.</p>

<p>It was a shit situation and he would have left well over $100 mil on the table if he had accepted the diagnosis and gone the full conservative route the Spurs wanted him to. So even tho I hated how it played out, I can’t say I would have done any different in his shoes.</p>

<p>I just want to point out you say “it’s not complicated” and continue providing this nuanced and balanced explanation that IS kinda complex.

      <label for="ljkg508" class="commentText"><p>lol - fair enough. You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s a nuanced situation. My meaning was more that the simplest explanation is seeming to be the right one as time goes on and little tidbits of additional info trickle out.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s always a slight tension in terms of what&rsquo;s best when it comes to &ldquo;best for the player&rdquo; vs &ldquo;best for the team&rdquo; - the players want to maximize their earnings, and the teams want to maximize their talent per dollar. We tend to commend players for signing reasonable contracts to win, but we can really only expect that up to a certain point.  It&rsquo;s just that what was best for the Spurs Org and what was best for Kawhi diverged way too much. The Spurs couldn&rsquo;t take the gamble that he&rsquo;d stay healthy enough to justify the kind of contract he would command, and Kawhi couldn&rsquo;t NOT gamble that he&rsquo;d stay healthy just long enough to earn his big payday. It would have been irresponsible for him not to at least try to maximize his time near the top.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no villains, and no need for Uncle Dennis conspiracies. Just a shit situation that maybe could have been handled better, but hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>, and I can&rsquo;t fault any particular party for trying to do their reasonable best with what was back then a highly uncertain future.</p>

      <label for="ljic43i" class="commentText"><p>Who really knows. In the end what actually led to the departure was Kawhi wanted the max but the spurs, who had been trying to communicate with him about how he was progressing for months, weren&rsquo;t confident about giving him that much money if the dude was gonna pull the same stunt and basically ghost the team again. They still didn&rsquo;t even get an update when pop talked to kawhi, there was also rumors coming out about the spurs, that doesn&rsquo;t happen ever even for spurs fans. So it was assumed someone was leaking stuff to the media, pop meeting with kawhi was also supposed to be a secret. Not even an hour passes before a picture of pop and kawhi eating at a near completely empty restaurant appears on the internet</p>

      <label for="ljkcqf1" class="commentText"><p>It seems likely that the Spurs understood the severity of Kawhi’s degenerative condition in his knees before Kawhi did.
With their medical knowledge they balked at the salary Kawhi (and Dennis) was asking for.</p>

<p>Then there’s the LA part of it. Kawhi was very motivated to go back home so when the relationship got strained he moved on mentally way before he actually left the team. The part that I’ll never get over as a spurs fan is that he skipped playoff games with the team while he was still a Spur to go home and go to a Dodger game with Magic. Whatever disagreement he had with the FO or Pop, that was such a shitty teammate move it still makes me mad.</p>

      <label for="ljloyjs" class="commentText"><p>I mean&hellip; I&rsquo;m a transplant Laker fan who is older and grew up going to Bulls games in the 90&rsquo;s. So I don&rsquo;t have a real connection to Kobe one way or the other. I didn&rsquo;t watch a lot of Kobe Lakers. And yeah, Kobe was a dick, so I get the vitriol. But&hellip; there was a court case with regard to the assault. It was discussed ad nauseam at the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying&hellip; why now the Kobe discussion? Has new shit come to light about that assault case or something?</p>
