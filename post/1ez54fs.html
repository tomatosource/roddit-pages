      <label for="lji5xkf" class="commentText"><p>That’s an amazingly beautiful story. I think hearing stories like these I get back to the fact that Pop would have probably retired had his wife not passed away. I may be wrong but I think getting lost in one’s job is one way of escaping.</p>

<p>Also, why did Kawhi leave again? Was it the San Antonio or bad treatment of him and his family by Pop? Did we ever find out?</p>

        <div>87 | 4 hours ago </div>
      </div>
      <label for="ljiegh2" class="commentText"><p>My recollection of what we know as the public (and my, obviously biased, view as a long-time Spurs fan):</p>

<p>Up until the Zaza incident, Kawhi was the heir apparent to Timmy. The quiet, 2-way superstar who played the right way and had developed what was in incredibly raw offensive game coming into the league to being a top 3 player in the league. (There can be arguments about how much of Kawhi&rsquo;s developed was helped by being with Pop and the Spurs development team, and how much was he hindered by playing within that system, but the results kind of speak for themselves).</p>

<p>Then he got injured. Everything after that gets murky.</p>

<ul>
<li>We know that he took time away from SA and the team. He was rarely around the team, and when he was, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of communication. He skipped out of town for the majority of the season and wasn&rsquo;t anywhere to be seen in the playoffs.</li>
<li>There was reportedly some disagreement about his injury recovery. As a long-time Spurs fan this has never made a lot of sense to me. This is an organisation that ALWAYS prioritised long term health of it&rsquo;s players over short-term wins. Pop has always been notorious for limiting guys minutes. Pop had made the decision to not let a peak Tim Duncan play in the &lsquo;00 playoffs when he was apparently fit to do so. It would be very out of character  for the Spurs to be forcing Kawhi to play if he wasn&rsquo;t fit.</li>
<li>Kawhi, reportedly, had his own doctors who had a different opinion to the Spurs medical staff, but also (reportedly) wasn&rsquo;t having any communication with the Spurs organisation. The famous report (im pretty sure from Rachel Nichols) was that the Spurs tried to meet him in New York and he literally hid from them.</li>
<li>There was the famous comment from Tony about &ldquo;I&rsquo;m older and have recovered from the same injury&rdquo;, and repeated responses by other Spurs vets of &ldquo;Ask Kawhi&rdquo; every time the media asked them where he was and when he was returning. Stephen Jackson will point to the Tony thing as the reason for Kawhi leaving, but I recall it happening after the New York stuff, and definitely after Kawhi had also spend a long time away from the team.</li>
<li>In hindsight it is obvious that the go-home factor was a part of this (possibly the biggest part), but we don&rsquo;t know if/when/how that was ever communicated to the team.</li>
<li>But in all this time, I don&rsquo;t think Kawhi ever actually requested a trade, (or it wasn&rsquo;t publicised), at least not until the offseason when he only had a year left. I believe the Spurs had put a max extension offer on the table for him (which I recall had been pulled by this stage), but the rumour was that he/agent (uncle) where unhappy either that the offer came too late, or were unhappy with his previous rookie extension (which remember was when he was still before his huge offensive breakout).</li>
<li>If Kawhi had actually requested a trade before the &lsquo;18 trade deadline, then I don&rsquo;t think most Spurs fans would have that big of a problem with him. At that stage, as a top-3 player in the league who was looking ready to come back from injury, you are probably getting AD-like trade returns. Players leave, and you would get upset, but you would get a trade return that actually reflects his worth.</li>
<li>Instead nothing happens until the end of the season, nobody knows where he&rsquo;s at mentally or physically, no-one wants to overpay for a guy who not only might leave in a year but might not actually show up (Windhorst actually reported this), and (my guess is that) the Lakers were so sure that he was coming in free agency that they tried to low-ball the Spurs (the biggest offer I have seen actually reported from LA was Ingram, Kuz and a First - <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38090407/western-conference-nba-biggest-ifs-five-years" target="_blank">Western Conference - NBA&rsquo;s biggest what-ifs of the past five years - ESPN</a>&hellip; so they lost out on Kawhi the same way the lost out on PG the year before. Probably why they finally pulled the trigger on the AD trade instead of waiting for free agency).  Instead the Spurs went with the Toronto offer, which from quick summary they have been able to turn into something like 5 FRP&rsquo;s (which I think is more than you would get from that LA package).</li>
<li>How much of this was actually about the injury? How much was about the personalities involved and feelings of mistreatment? And how much was truly about just wanting to go home and be with his family (my gut is that it is all about this - and I have consistently said that I have no problem with Kawhi making that decision. I just think there better ways for that to happen). If he had made a trade request earlier, and/or told the Spurs that he wanted to go home a year earlier and the team didn&rsquo;t look at trades then - well then that&rsquo;s on the team.</li>

      <label for="ljiwlqq" class="commentText"><p>Thank you for such a great summary!</p>

<p>I am also a Spurs fan and thus biased. What jumps out to me is that Kawhi seems to have had a very very bad injury history and I am not sure if doing it on his own helped his longevity. This is of course pure speculation and his knees might have gone either way, but to not trust the org who had a myriad of injury prone players and yet still helped them play for a long time. Idk… I guess I am still sour even if the Raptors run was great and I was rooting for them.</p>

<p>On a side note - I trust nothing that S Jackson is spewing. The man is bitter and pure poison.</p>

<p>On another note - Murray wanted to leave to. It did not get better for him. At least Kawhi has a ring to show for leaving (although not to his preferred destination right away). I would not want Dejounte with Wemby, even though 2 years ago that might have seemed like a dream combo.</p>

      <label for="ljj06os" class="commentText"><p>I think this was exactly the issue.  Spurs knew the guy needed care, but Kawhi wanted to treat his injuries his own way.  You don&rsquo;t hear anything about Kawhi refusing to work with team medical staff with his teams now, so to the extent this is accurate this might have been a phase he and his ppl went through at that particular time which helped cause the rift.</p>

      <label for="ljijrkv" class="commentText"><p>Do you think that Derozan, Poeltl and a First for Kawhi and Danny Green was actually a fair trade for a prime Kawhi if not for these other issues?</p>

<p>The Spurs are clowned for that being a one-sided trade, but there is no evidence of there actually being anything better on the table.</p>

<p>So either you I think it was actually a good trade for the Spurs, OR you think that teams weren&rsquo;t offering full value for Kawhi (and have to accept there were reasons for this)? Which is it?</p>

      <label for="ljihzsf" class="commentText"><p>It wasn’t about the foul line booing, fwiw. Foul shots are just when Popovich had the time to do it. Crowd boos Kawhi every time he touches the ball, and it was annoying Pop, who still shares a good relationship with  Kawhi. </p>

<p>Pop has been in the business for a long time, he understands fans booing opposing players at the foul line.</p>

      <label for="ljic43i" class="commentText"><p>Who really knows. In the end what actually led to the departure was Kawhi wanted the max but the spurs, who had been trying to communicate with him about how he was progressing for months, weren&rsquo;t confident about giving him that much money if the dude was gonna pull the same stunt and basically ghost the team again. They still didn&rsquo;t even get an update when pop talked to kawhi, there was also rumors coming out about the spurs, that doesn&rsquo;t happen ever even for spurs fans. So it was assumed someone was leaking stuff to the media, pop meeting with kawhi was also supposed to be a secret. Not even an hour passes before a picture of pop and kawhi eating at a near completely empty restaurant appears on the internet</p>

The Lakers had no money and would&rsquo;ve had to make a trade to get him for the money he wanted even if he did take a decent discount.
