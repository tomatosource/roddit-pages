      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1foqy2i/i_feel_like_hypotheticals_are_fun_but_when/"><p>I feel like hypotheticals are fun, but when comparing players people get too carried away</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I saw a couple of posts comparing Tim Duncan and KG, and opinions that if you swap their careers then KG would be the best power forward of all time, and I thought that while possible, we can&rsquo;t just compare things this way.</p>

<p>First, I am not arguing about eirher of their talents, I think both Duncan and KG are amongst the most talented players of all time. And I understand that Tim&rsquo;s circumstances were much better from the get go, while Garnett was in a trash team.</p>

<p>But bringing the swap argument shouldn&rsquo;t be a big factor, since, well, it would open a whole another can of worms - other hypotheticals. If we can apply this argument to KG, then we can apply it to everyone else. What if Magic went to Bulls, and not Lakers, what if Kobe was drafted by Hornets and kept. What if Suns got Luka, what if Pistons took Carmelo or Wade. Trying to get some sort of objectivity becomes impossible, because you can always make up a million plausinble scenarios of what could have happened, an everything then just becomes &lsquo;I feel like this is player is better, and if this didn&rsquo;t happen, and that happened, it would have confirmed my opinion&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So, in this case, I think we have to acknowledge circumstances, overall talent of the player, and what actually happened. You could argue that KG had a higher peak, or Tim Duncan, that KG was a better defender, or vice versa. But in the end, Tim Duncan is the guy who has 5 rings. He had better longevity, and it&rsquo;s not like Duncan was always having best teams, and KG never had any good support. Tim Duncan had to carry too, and he did it successfully, while KG got a superteam in Boston.</p>

<p>Also, in terms of comparison, Tim Duncan and KG were in such different situations, that it&rsquo;s indeed difficult. But what would be in favour of Duncan is actually comparing Garnett to another Power Forward - Dirk. Both were drafted in bad teams, both had lackluster supproting cast (at least in the beginning), both won 1 MVP and 1 ring(both were finals MVPs). And you can argue that KG was better because of defence, but Dirk was a much better scorer, he won with the franchise that drafted him, in one of the greatest playoff runs of all time, and had a much longer peak. I think there is a legitimate argumemt for Dirk to be higher all time, just as there is a legitimate argument for KG.</p>

<p>So, in the end I feel like these sort of hypothetical are completely fine, and they can be very fun to discuss, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a major argument when discussing which player was or is better</p>

<p>If people are going to put Kobe down because he played with Shaq, then Duncan is equally deserving to be criticized for his fortunate draft situation</p>

      <label for="los07qb" class="commentText"><p>yep. most fans can’t do context. NBA fans might be the worst too. Obviously results are king but there‘s always context. Tim Duncan probably isn’t who he is without being drafted in San Antonio just like Mahomes probably wouldn’t be where he is now if Jacksonville or Cleveland got him instead of KC</p>

<p>The Spurs weren’t <em>really</em> a bad team. They were a good team that had to play without their superstar (Robinson) for an entire season.</p>
