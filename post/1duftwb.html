      <label for="lbhbc7g" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if $20 MM per year for a 18 ppg on 40% 3PT with average defense is &ldquo;taking care of him&rdquo; considering what some players are getting today.  Those numbers don&rsquo;t really warrant the KLANK Thompson meme.  I mean in the 2017 playoffs, 7 years ago, he averaged 15 ppg on 50% TS compared to this playoffs where he did 18 ppg on 52% TS.</p>

<p>That is just Klay, he can and will go cold.  I don&rsquo;t think a big guard shooter with those numbers is a dead weight at 34.  And who the Warriors got in place of Klay are not going to make them contenders.  Dallas on the other hand might get a few playoff series where Klay runs white hot especially with Luka feeding him.</p>

Then after their run with kd they gave him a max contract even tho he was injured at the time and he only played 3 years out of the 5. Now they trying to have klay take a paycut to grab another star but he still wants more money even tho they gave him his loyalty contract already (the max contract) klay just being greedy at this point</p>

They took a risk on him coming back and being the same guy. They also had no clue he would also get injured while rehabbing. Klay Thompson was worth the risk of a max in 2019 even while injured, in no way was that a loyalty contract.</p>

I think he still has a lot left to give to the game, but the amount of energy he had to expend to get decent looks at the hoop with the warriors spacing issues just isn’t viable for someone with his age and injury history.</p>

<p>Klay averaged the most minutes on the team that playoffs run while Poole played like 15mpg in the finals cuz of how bad his defense is.</p>

<p>This is the hard part; you want Klay for all he has done for the team. What he tried to do when he busted his knee, running on the sidelines, taking the free throws&hellip; That&rsquo;s the stuff that you want to reward.</p>

<p>But at the cost of the future?</p>

<p>But then I look and go, &ldquo;well, now you didn&rsquo;t tribute Klay, NOR did you improve for the future&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is like when the bulls traded Rose, and signed DWade. It&rsquo;s incompetence.</p>

Klay was an awesome defensive player before the injuries, there was a point he was in the convo of best two way player in the league, and he is getting a statue in front of Chase Center for a reason.</p>

<p>But I watch a lot of Warriors games and Draymond was always the 2nd most important piece of those Championship teams, even more important than KD imo.</p>

<p>IDK that there&rsquo;s a point in this that would have gotten Klay more money or a better situation than he had with that Warriors contract. Maybe he could have been the top guy on a bad team, but I don&rsquo;t see where he was some major bargain deserving of supreme loyalty.</p>

Immediately paying klay without getting those two needs addressed would be the same as essentially running it back.

<p>They gave him a 4 max deal to rehab for 2 and offered <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>48</sub> last year. Im sorry but the warriors owed nothing to klay at this point.</p>

      <label for="lbgi894" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. This discourse is all Klay. The Warriors stuck with him after the injury and did right by him. Paid obscene amounts of tax money to keep him and try to be competitive while he was out. And now when they ask him to take less and wait to see if they can improve for another shot at contending he felt &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo;. Not to mention all the complaining last season when he was playing like garbage.</p>

<p>That’s not really how free agency works though. Because the Mavericks weren’t going to wait a week to see if they could get Klay while every other available player ended up somewhere else.</p>

      <label for="lbgejyl" class="commentText"><p>Obviously both sides are in damage control, so I don&rsquo;t know what stock to put in this.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, if this was a conversation that happened before July 1st, there were really clear reasons the Warriors weren&rsquo;t ready to lock in Klay&rsquo;s money. <em>If</em> they were intending to guarantee a significant chunk of CP3&rsquo;s money in a trade for PG13 or someone else, they couldn&rsquo;t do that with Klay&rsquo;s money on the books, because that would have made them a 2nd apron team when the trade went down.</p>

<p>Granted, them making that kind of deal likely would have doomed Klay coming back anyway, but the order of operation the Warriors were looking at was clear. If Klay felt disrespected because of how cap rules dictated the Warriors needed to act to keep options open, then I guess it just kinda is what it is.</p>

<p>this is more or less the same logic behind Brunson not getting extended in january 2022&hellip;nico was very clearly focused on moving KP, and didnt make any extensions until after the trade deadline, in order to keep his options open (DFS didn&rsquo;t get resigned until after the deadline and he was more valuable to the Mavs than Brunson up until that point)</p>

<p>The Warriors would&rsquo;ve been happy as hell to do the same to Dlo cause that would&rsquo;ve been an even bigger TPE.</p>

      <label for="lbhidrk" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think this is the right take.</p>

<p>If the Warriors made the playoffs and then made it at least to the WCF this year, they give Klay the bag regardless of how Klay played.</p>

<p>If Klay played out of his mind this year but they still missed the playoffs after running the largest payroll in NBA history, they still have no choice but to let him walk. He gets a bigger bag but still on another team.</p>

<p>Klay&rsquo;s individual performance had nothing to do with this not working out. It&rsquo;s 100% about team performance and payroll.</p>

<p>Klay didn&rsquo;t bet on himself, he bet on the team. If his primary goal is to get another ring, he didn&rsquo;t lose. He has a better opportunity now than had he signed an extension.</p>

      <label for="lbh549t" class="commentText"><p>I think it also has to do with our unique situation. Our terrible cap situation plus our lack of a genuine 2nd scoring option meant we couldn&rsquo;t give him a big contract immediately. He&rsquo;s not good enough anymore to be a 2nd option and if we signed him, we would lose all flexibility and chance to get a 2nd option.</p>

<p>That being said, I think for Dallas and Klay this is a good decision. He won&rsquo;t need to be a 2nd option on that team, and he will be in a great situation with an offense led by Luka and Kyrie.</p>

      <label for="lbh3sb0" class="commentText"><p>Timing is everything. Last year they offered Klay and Green deals. Green took his. They were in &ldquo;run it back&rdquo; mode last offseason.</p>

<p>Then the season happened.</p>

<p>After a year where they had the biggest payroll in the history of the NBA and paid $200M in luxury tax they  missed the playoffs. They aren&rsquo;t going to be better next year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run it back&rdquo; is not an option anymore. They now have sobering reality.</p>

<p>Klay made his proposal offer only after they realized how screwed up their roster is and are in a low-key rebuild mode.</p>

<p>Their goal this season is no longer to compete but instead to shed payroll so they can potentially get in a competitive year before Steph retires.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see on the court for Klay but mentally, it is for the best he has moved on. It is for the best for the Warriors culturally. This team has a lot of young dudes now and the environment in San Fran has not been great the last few years, and that is not the kind of climate you want to develop young players in.</p>

      <label for="lbgm39v" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t blame Klay for feeling the way he does toward the split and the Warriors currently. I really don&rsquo;t. Because of what he&rsquo;s been through to get back to action at all. It does sting. He does lack self-awareness, which is a product of all the titles and the almost delusional ego that&rsquo;s necessary to be great. But I think it&rsquo;d sting for almost any human. It&rsquo;s a very humbling and hard way for things to end and he&rsquo;s clearly hurt by it.</p>

      <label for="lbhbtip" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not like the club didn&rsquo;t give him a max deal while knowing they&rsquo;d lose a season (ended up being 2) to injury. And yeah, they needed to see if there was a path to improvement as well. It sucks that Klay is gone, but Klay has been gone for a while now and what remains is probably a 7th man.</p>
