      <label for="lbhbc7g" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if $20 MM per year for a 18 ppg on 40% 3PT with average defense is &ldquo;taking care of him&rdquo; considering what some players are getting today.  Those numbers don&rsquo;t really warrant the KLANK Thompson meme.  I mean in the 2017 playoffs, 7 years ago, he averaged 15 ppg on 50% TS compared to this playoffs where he did 18 ppg on 52% TS.</p>

<p>That is just Klay, he can and will go cold.  I don&rsquo;t think a big guard shooter with those numbers is a dead weight at 34.  And who the Warriors got in place of Klay are not going to make them contenders.  Dallas on the other hand might get a few playoff series where Klay runs white hot especially with Luka feeding him.</p>

Anyone who&rsquo;s followed the Warriors knows Klay never wanted to be anywhere else.  He constantly said he&rsquo;d finish his career there.</p>

<p>I hope he balls out with the Mavs just because I don&rsquo;t want him to go out like a bitch.  He&rsquo;s been so great for basketball, not just his play but his attitude.  I wanna see him go out on top.</p>

Klay had no argument there, he didn’t stick with the Warriors he stuck with Kerr, Dray and Steph. It was a mutual benefit between both sides. Both sides made hundreds of millions of dollars while winning multiple championships.  Now Klay wants the Kobe treatment.

<p>This is the hard part; you want Klay for all he has done for the team. What he tried to do when he busted his knee, running on the sidelines, taking the free throws&hellip; That&rsquo;s the stuff that you want to reward.</p>

<p>But at the cost of the future?</p>

<p>But then I look and go, &ldquo;well, now you didn&rsquo;t tribute Klay, NOR did you improve for the future&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is like when the bulls traded Rose, and signed DWade. It&rsquo;s incompetence.</p>

      <label for="lbh7jk7" class="commentText"><p>I am a huge fan of Klay, my 2nd favorite Warrior ever after Steph, and he was super nice the time my daughter and I got to meet him. Klay was an awesome defensive player before the injuries, there was a point he was in the convo of best two way player in the league, and he is getting a statue in front of Chase Center for a reason.</p>

<p>But I watch a lot of Warriors games and Draymond was always the 2nd most important piece of those Championship teams, even more important than KD imo.</p>

<p>Klay is a better scorer but Draymond is better at basically everything else, by a decent amount too. Draymond is the one who’s been the defensive anchor. Draymond is the one who affects the team more with his absence. Draymond is the piece that makes everything click.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <em>nowhere</em> near that lol.  Average US CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 272-1 in 2022.  But I agree with your other point.</p>

<p>But with average NBA salary of about <span class="math inline">\(5mil, and David Stern making \)</span>25mil annually, NBA players are closer in the pay gap to their CEO by 1:5 ratio then us regular people who is 1:272. So the fact that OP was saying “off the backs of X players” is asinine.</p>

<p>Again I hate agreeing with corporations but people have to stop spewing fake info</p>

<p>IDK that there&rsquo;s a point in this that would have gotten Klay more money or a better situation than he had with that Warriors contract. Maybe he could have been the top guy on a bad team, but I don&rsquo;t see where he was some major bargain deserving of supreme loyalty.</p>

Immediately paying klay without getting those two needs addressed would be the same as essentially running it back.

Paid obscene amounts of tax money to keep him and try to be competitive while he was out. And now when they ask him to take less and wait to see if they can improve for another shot at contending he felt &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo;. Not to mention all the complaining last season when he was playing like garbage.</p>

<p>That’s not really how free agency works though. Because the Mavericks weren’t going to wait a week to see if they could get Klay while every other available player ended up somewhere else.</p>

      <label for="lbga750" class="commentText"><p>Klay clearly wasn&rsquo;t a #2 option material anymore so the Warriors waited to see if they could get a #2. And Klay left knowing that the Warriors were going to get him to wait as long as possible. And that&rsquo;s fair game from both sides.</p>

<p>Besides I think he just wanted a fresh start and I can&rsquo;t blame him either.</p>

      <label for="lbgomf1" class="commentText"><p>Another thing is that waiting too long could leave Klay without a team or taking worse offers. This off-season is pretty much the first in a while where a shitload of players didn’t sign contracts the minute it opens.</p>

      <label for="lbgejyl" class="commentText"><p>Obviously both sides are in damage control, so I don&rsquo;t know what stock to put in this.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, if this was a conversation that happened before July 1st, there were really clear reasons the Warriors weren&rsquo;t ready to lock in Klay&rsquo;s money. <em>If</em> they were intending to guarantee a significant chunk of CP3&rsquo;s money in a trade for PG13 or someone else, they couldn&rsquo;t do that with Klay&rsquo;s money on the books, because that would have made them a 2nd apron team when the trade went down.</p>

<p>Granted, them making that kind of deal likely would have doomed Klay coming back anyway, but the order of operation the Warriors were looking at was clear. If Klay felt disrespected because of how cap rules dictated the Warriors needed to act to keep options open, then I guess it just kinda is what it is.</p>

<p>this is more or less the same logic behind Brunson not getting extended in january 2022&hellip;nico was very clearly focused on moving KP, and didnt make any extensions until after the trade deadline, in order to keep his options open (DFS didn&rsquo;t get resigned until after the deadline and he was more valuable to the Mavs than Brunson up until that point)</p>

<p>It’s very obvious if Klay got what he wanted from the Warriors he would’ve stayed. He bet on himself to get the max / near max money and lost, and then focused on fit and chose Dallas (which I’m happy for because I wanted Klay on the Lakers but not at 4 years / 80 mill)</p>

      <label for="lbh549t" class="commentText"><p>I think it also has to do with our unique situation. Our terrible cap situation plus our lack of a genuine 2nd scoring option meant we couldn&rsquo;t give him a big contract immediately. He&rsquo;s not good enough anymore to be a 2nd option and if we signed him, we would lose all flexibility and chance to get a 2nd option.</p>

<p>That being said, I think for Dallas and Klay this is a good decision. He won&rsquo;t need to be a 2nd option on that team, and he will be in a great situation with an offense led by Luka and Kyrie.</p>

      <label for="lbh3sb0" class="commentText"><p>Timing is everything. Last year they offered Klay and Green deals. Green took his. They were in &ldquo;run it back&rdquo; mode last offseason.</p>

<p>Then the season happened.</p>

<p>After a year where they had the biggest payroll in the history of the NBA and paid $200M in luxury tax they  missed the playoffs. They aren&rsquo;t going to be better next year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run it back&rdquo; is not an option anymore. They now have sobering reality.</p>

<p>Klay made his proposal offer only after they realized how screwed up their roster is and are in a low-key rebuild mode.</p>

<p>Their goal this season is no longer to compete but instead to shed payroll so they can potentially get in a competitive year before Steph retires.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see on the court for Klay but mentally, it is for the best he has moved on. It is for the best for the Warriors culturally. This team has a lot of young dudes now and the environment in San Fran has not been great the last few years, and that is not the kind of climate you want to develop young players in.</p>

Because of what he&rsquo;s been through to get back to action at all. It does sting. He does lack self-awareness, which is a product of all the titles and the almost delusional ego that&rsquo;s necessary to be great. But I think it&rsquo;d sting for almost any human. It&rsquo;s a very humbling and hard way for things to end and he&rsquo;s clearly hurt by it.</p>

But what they&rsquo;ve done so far doesn&rsquo;t elevate them past what they were last season, unless they get 2nd-best-on-a-championship-team Wiggins back.</p>
