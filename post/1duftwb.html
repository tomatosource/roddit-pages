      <label for="lbhbc7g" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if $20 MM per year for a 18 ppg on 40% 3PT with average defense is &ldquo;taking care of him&rdquo; considering what some players are getting today.  Those numbers don&rsquo;t really warrant the KLANK Thompson meme.  I mean in the 2017 playoffs, 7 years ago, he averaged 15 ppg on 50% TS compared to this playoffs where he did 18 ppg on 52% TS.</p>

<p>That is just Klay, he can and will go cold.  I don&rsquo;t think a big guard shooter with those numbers is a dead weight at 34.  And who the Warriors got in place of Klay are not going to make them contenders.  Dallas on the other hand might get a few playoff series where Klay runs white hot especially with Luka feeding him.</p>

Then after their run with kd they gave him a max contract even tho he was injured at the time and he only played 3 years out of the 5. Now they trying to have klay take a paycut to grab another star but he still wants more money even tho they gave him his loyalty contract already (the max contract) klay just being greedy at this point</p>

      <label for="lbhj59s" class="commentText"><p>Disagree. Someone would’ve gave Klay a max even though he was injured. That wasn’t a loyalty contract. They took a risk on him coming back and being the same guy. They also had no clue he would also get injured while rehabbing. Klay Thompson was worth the risk of a max in 2019 even while injured, in no way was that a loyalty contract.</p>

      <label for="lbhe9mf" class="commentText"><p>Totally agree on Klay’s streakiness, but the one distinction I’ll make is that last year was the second postseason in a row where his legs looked completely shot. I think he still has a lot left to give to the game, but the amount of energy he had to expend to get decent looks at the hoop with the warriors spacing issues just isn’t viable for someone with his age and injury history.</p>

      <label for="lbi4v6c" class="commentText"><p>He’ll see so many open looks for Luka just by standing in the corner Reggie Bullock style. Mavs need the spacing he brings and a player to hit this big open 3s - Klay can still hit those. His athleticism is a shell of his prime, but he’s still a smart defender, and the Mavs defensive scheme is great at compensating for the backcourt as long as they hit their assignments. Bottom line - Klay is making Tim Hardaway Jr. money, so this should be a good move for Dallas.</p>

Klay had no argument there, he didn’t stick with the Warriors he stuck with Kerr, Dray and Steph. It was a mutual benefit between both sides. Both sides made hundreds of millions of dollars while winning multiple championships.  Now Klay wants the Kobe treatment. He wanted to be treated like Batman when he was <del>Robin</del> Alfred this entire time.</p>

<p>This is the hard part; you want Klay for all he has done for the team. What he tried to do when he busted his knee, running on the sidelines, taking the free throws&hellip; That&rsquo;s the stuff that you want to reward.</p>

<p>But at the cost of the future?</p>

<p>But then I look and go, &ldquo;well, now you didn&rsquo;t tribute Klay, NOR did you improve for the future&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like, that sounds great and all. But not every team has the luxury of having their superstar PG run around off ball to break defenses. Dray is old now and is a shell of himself, but there was a point where he was Giannis-light. His vision and passing were top notch for a big man, and the KD-era Warriors benefited from that immensely. Then he could turn around and protect the rim with the best of them.</p>

Klay was an awesome defensive player before the injuries, there was a point he was in the convo of best two way player in the league, and he is getting a statue in front of Chase Center for a reason.</p>

<p>But I watch a lot of Warriors games and Draymond was always the 2nd most important piece of those Championship teams, even more important than KD imo.</p>

<p>IDK that there&rsquo;s a point in this that would have gotten Klay more money or a better situation than he had with that Warriors contract. Maybe he could have been the top guy on a bad team, but I don&rsquo;t see where he was some major bargain deserving of supreme loyalty.</p>

<p>Klay wanted to lock in an extension, Warriors decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth automatically paying and wanted to shop. Klay decided that he didn&rsquo;t want that and left somewhere else.</p>

      <label for="lbg6i0b" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think warriors number 1 priority this season was to find a number two scoring option and then shore up defense. Immediately paying klay without getting those two needs addressed would be the same as essentially running it back. Don’t blame klay for not wanting to wait since it could have meant less money available across the board</p>

      <label for="lbgi894" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. This discourse is all Klay. The Warriors stuck with him after the injury and did right by him. Paid obscene amounts of tax money to keep him and try to be competitive while he was out. And now when they ask him to take less and wait to see if they can improve for another shot at contending he felt &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo;. Not to mention all the complaining last season when he was playing like garbage.</p>

      <label for="lbgejyl" class="commentText"><p>Obviously both sides are in damage control, so I don&rsquo;t know what stock to put in this.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, if this was a conversation that happened before July 1st, there were really clear reasons the Warriors weren&rsquo;t ready to lock in Klay&rsquo;s money. <em>If</em> they were intending to guarantee a significant chunk of CP3&rsquo;s money in a trade for PG13 or someone else, they couldn&rsquo;t do that with Klay&rsquo;s money on the books, because that would have made them a 2nd apron team when the trade went down.</p>

<p>Granted, them making that kind of deal likely would have doomed Klay coming back anyway, but the order of operation the Warriors were looking at was clear. If Klay felt disrespected because of how cap rules dictated the Warriors needed to act to keep options open, then I guess it just kinda is what it is.</p>

<p>this is more or less the same logic behind Brunson not getting extended in january 2022&hellip;nico was very clearly focused on moving KP, and didnt make any extensions until after the trade deadline, in order to keep his options open (DFS didn&rsquo;t get resigned until after the deadline and he was more valuable to the Mavs than Brunson up until that point)</p>

<p>Agree with this and if this article is to be believed, then a lot more went into the decision than just potential perceived disrespect.</p>

<p>Going to a lower media profile team was something that the article emphasizes, as it does much to explain not going with a Lakers offer for more money/years, despite the appeal of being a Laker.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also role and playing time. Not coming off the bench at GSW and starting for the Mavs.</p>

<p>Also the higher chance of contending for another title with the Mavs.</p>

That&rsquo;s not the Warriors saying HELL NO like you said, thats the Lakers not being able to find a 3rd team to make the deal work. And again, we don&rsquo;t even know if that&rsquo;s actually the case. All we know is the Lakers were rumored to have offered Klay something around <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>80</sub></p>

      <label for="lbhidrk" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think this is the right take.</p>

<p>If the Warriors made the playoffs and then made it at least to the WCF this year, they give Klay the bag regardless of how Klay played.</p>

<p>If Klay played out of his mind this year but they still missed the playoffs after running the largest payroll in NBA history, they still have no choice but to let him walk. He gets a bigger bag but still on another team.</p>

<p>Klay&rsquo;s individual performance had nothing to do with this not working out. It&rsquo;s 100% about team performance and payroll.</p>

<p>Klay didn&rsquo;t bet on himself, he bet on the team. If his primary goal is to get another ring, he didn&rsquo;t lose. He has a better opportunity now than had he signed an extension.</p>

      <label for="lbh3sb0" class="commentText"><p>Timing is everything. Last year they offered Klay and Green deals. Green took his. They were in &ldquo;run it back&rdquo; mode last offseason.</p>

<p>Then the season happened.</p>

<p>After a year where they had the biggest payroll in the history of the NBA and paid $200M in luxury tax they  missed the playoffs. They aren&rsquo;t going to be better next year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run it back&rdquo; is not an option anymore. They now have sobering reality.</p>

<p>Klay made his proposal offer only after they realized how screwed up their roster is and are in a low-key rebuild mode.</p>

<p>Their goal this season is no longer to compete but instead to shed payroll so they can potentially get in a competitive year before Steph retires.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see on the court for Klay but mentally, it is for the best he has moved on. It is for the best for the Warriors culturally. This team has a lot of young dudes now and the environment in San Fran has not been great the last few years, and that is not the kind of climate you want to develop young players in.</p>

      <label for="lbgjk8x" class="commentText"><p>As someone who watches the Warriors extensively. Klay is the point he is just a streaky shooter who is a defensive liability. Younger quicker guards blow by him. Sometimes it’s best for both parties to move on.</p>

      <label for="lbgm39v" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t blame Klay for feeling the way he does toward the split and the Warriors currently. I really don&rsquo;t. Because of what he&rsquo;s been through to get back to action at all. It does sting. He does lack self-awareness, which is a product of all the titles and the almost delusional ego that&rsquo;s necessary to be great. But I think it&rsquo;d sting for almost any human. It&rsquo;s a very humbling and hard way for things to end and he&rsquo;s clearly hurt by it.</p>

Maybe they felt it was time to test the waters in search of improvement. Both sides made an offer (maybe, this may be hard feelings), and the Warriors eventually helped him trade his way to Dallas.</p>

This guy led the league in 3pm last year and played great coming back from injury when they won the championship.  He probably knew the warriors didn’t want him and was dealing with that all season. People talking trash about his shooting but who on GS outside of Steph can make consistent 3s now. Good luck with that</p>
