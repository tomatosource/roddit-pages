      <p>I didn&rsquo;t get to see the series, but the Lakers were a 61 win team with 4 all stars and had the highest net rating. It seems surprising that they couldn&rsquo;t win even 1 game against the Jazz in the WCF. What went wrong?</p>

      <label for="loq0rmc" class="commentText"><p>Shaq was never good at defending the pick and roll. We beat them 4-1 the year prior either. You could replay that series 10 times and the Lakers probably don’t win a single one. The only real weakness of those Jazz squads was Ostertag at center but he was actually useful against Shaq (then completely useless in the finals).</p>

      <label for="loqcaom" class="commentText"><p>A combination of factors. Shaq struggled defending utahs bread and butter, which was the pick and roll. Ostertag couldn’t contain shaq but he did have the size to at least make shaq work for his points. John Stockton was a superior floor general vs van exel, which is not a knock on Nick since stockton is an all time great. Eddie Jones struggled mightily against the physical jazz defense, and he oddly couldn’t exploit his athletic advantage against hornacek. Horry was severely outmatched against malone, and Greg foster was able to coax elden Campbell out to the perimeter to negate campbells interior defense. And kobe was only 19.</p>

<p>The jazz were also better coached (Jerry Sloan rip) than the lakers were. They often ran plays for malone where either stockton or hornacek would get malone the ball in the low block, then they would run to the opposite baseline to give malone the space the abuse horry. The lakers had no answer for it.</p>

<p>One of those all stars was Van Exel and he and the coach were not getting along at all (this is the famous Cancun season.) In the Jazz series he was no longer starting and just played terribly.</p>

<p>That Laker team was just a chemistry mess. Kobe was not loved by the bets, Van Exel and the coach weren&rsquo;t getting along, and Shaq and a couple of those all stars were also rumored to have issues.</p>

<p>Couple that with the fact that the Jazz were really good and the Lakers weren&rsquo;t quite ready to be a championship team.</p>

      <label for="lopx2op" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was 19 years old</p>

<p>By the time he turned 20 and developed more, it was over for the league.</p>

<p>People need to be reminded that Kobe couldn&rsquo;t sign his NBA contract, and had his mother sign it for him because he wasn&rsquo;t 18 yet when he entered the league.</p>

<p>Kobe was raw and was rightfully drafted mid first round - so to start this dialogue of &ldquo;Kobe was drafted to a winning team!&rdquo; is not a point to make, especially when Tim Duncan was even more fortunate in this regard.</p>

<p>Nobody knew how Kobe was going to gel with Shaq, and Kobe&rsquo;s early development years were a testament to that.</p>

<p>If Kobe developed some years in college like Duncan did, and get drafted to a very competitive team as a first pick, he&rsquo;d also have a first team all nba in his first year</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t understand how fortunate of a career Tim Duncan had, to be drafted first pick to a 45-50 win team and possibly the goat organization.</p>

      <label for="loq0iy2" class="commentText"><p>Because draft position is supposed to correlate with whether or not you&rsquo;re a winning team</p>

<p>Being drafted at 13 to a winning team isn&rsquo;t out of the ordinary</p>

<p>Being drafted at 1 is</p>

<p>There is a reason why Adam Silver made the change so that the lowest record doesn&rsquo;t get the automatic first pick, because the Spurs abused that system, and many other teams tried to follow suit - honestly the spurs org was just one step ahead of everyone else</p>

<p>Even resting the players for the players like the Spurs big 3 - Adam Silver implemented a rule where you can&rsquo;t rest players just because you want them to rest for the postseason, you know why? because every other team started to follow suit with the spurs</p>

<p>Spurs org was just one step ahead of everyone else</p>

<p>Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Tim Duncan were the only first picks in modern NBA history to have been drafted to a competitive team.</p>

<p>All other first picks fell to a lottery team as it was designed.</p>

<p>This is the case for Wemby - If Wemby was drafted to the Tim Duncan spurs, he&rsquo;d also have a first team all nba, and a post season already in his rookie season</p>

<p>But Wemby was drafted first pick, to a lottery team, AS IT WAS DESIGNED.</p>

      <label for="loq72cw" class="commentText"><p>Kobe didn&rsquo;t get &ldquo;drafted by&rdquo; the Hornets. The Lakers traded up to the Hornets pick, and since in the NBA teams can&rsquo;t actually trade draft picks the day of the draft, the Hornets picked Kobe on the Lakers behalf. It didn&rsquo;t matter if it was the Hornets, or Bullets, or Wolves, or whoever. The Lakers / Jerry West wanted to get a top 10-ish pick to get Kobe.</p>

<p>How so many NBA fans don&rsquo;t even understand basic rules like draft day trades is crazy to me. Other sports fans at least know these things.</p>

<p>&lsquo;97 Spurs won 20 games and missed the playoffs (year before Duncan)</p>

<p>&lsquo;98 Spurs won 56 games and lost in 5 (to Utah) in the 2nd round (Duncan&rsquo;s first season)</p>

<p>Also you&rsquo;re making a first pick of a draft equivalent to the 13th pick of the draft.</p>

      <label for="lopytaf" class="commentText"><p>Phil Jackson had all time players fall into his lap and relied on their individual isolation skills.</p>

<p>Phil isn&rsquo;t a whiteboard coach, he&rsquo;s an ego manager.</p>

<p>Also, the organization as a whole, Spurs absolutely destroy the Lakers during this period, and the extension of the spurs dominance with the addition of Manu, Parker, and Kawhi Leonard is why you can&rsquo;t just credit Pop, but also RC Buford as well.</p>

<p>Small Market winning &amp;gt; Big Market winning</p>

<p>Spurs made Tim Duncan</p>

<p>You know the Spurs also lost to the Jazz (in 5) that season, too?</p>

      <label for="loq1smc" class="commentText"><p>Cool, I like Wemby&rsquo;s stats and potential better</p>

<p>Put him on those spurs and he&rsquo;d have quite the career as well</p>

<p>Too bad Wemby got drafted to a legit lottery team as a first pick as it was designed and couldn&rsquo;t budge the W/L column for the spurs.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait till Wemby forces a trade and Pop retired, it will bring a whole new discussion to Tim Duncan&rsquo;s boosted career</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you give Tim Duncan a winning career, but you can&rsquo;t do it for me&rdquo;</p>

<p>can&rsquo;t wait for the spurs not make the playoffs yet again this season.</p>

<p>and next</p>
