      <p>I didn&rsquo;t get to see the series, but the Lakers were a 61 win team with 4 all stars and had the highest net rating. It seems surprising that they couldn&rsquo;t win even 1 game against the Jazz in the WCF. What went wrong?</p>

Lakers did fine get to the West Finals; got a better coach and got the chip the next nonlockout season.</p>

You could replay that series 10 times and the Lakers probably don’t win a single one. The only real weakness of those Jazz squads was Ostertag at center but he was actually useful against Shaq (then completely useless in the finals).</p>

      <label for="lopx2op" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was 19 years old</p>

<p>By the time he turned 20 and developed more, it was over for the league.</p>

<p>People need to be reminded that Kobe couldn&rsquo;t sign his NBA contract, and had his mother sign it for him because he wasn&rsquo;t 18 yet when he entered the league.</p>

<p>Kobe was raw and was rightfully drafted mid first round - so to start this dialogue of &ldquo;Kobe was drafted to a winning team!&rdquo; is not a point to make, especially when Tim Duncan was even more fortunate in this regard.</p>

<p>Nobody knew how Kobe was going to gel with Shaq, and Kobe&rsquo;s early development years were a testament to that.</p>

<p>If Kobe developed some years in college like Duncan did, and get drafted to a very competitive team as a first pick, he&rsquo;d also have a first team all nba in his first year</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t understand how fortunate of a career Tim Duncan had, to be drafted first pick to a 45-50 win team and possibly the goat organization.</p>

<p>Phil isn&rsquo;t a whiteboard coach, he&rsquo;s an ego manager.</p>

<p>Also, the organization as a whole, Spurs absolutely destroy the Lakers during this period, and the extension of the spurs dominance with the addition of Manu, Parker, and Kawhi Leonard is why you can&rsquo;t just credit Pop, but also RC Buford as well.</p>

<p>Small Market winning &amp;gt; Big Market winning</p>

      <label for="loq0iy2" class="commentText"><p>Because draft position is supposed to correlate with whether or not you&rsquo;re a winning team</p>

<p>Being drafted at 13 to a winning team isn&rsquo;t out of the ordinary</p>

<p>Being drafted at 1 is</p>

<p>There is a reason why Adam Silver made the change so that the lowest record doesn&rsquo;t get the automatic first pick, because the Spurs abused that system, and many other teams tried to follow suit - honestly the spurs org was just one step ahead of everyone else</p>

<p>Even resting the players for the players like the Spurs big 3 - Adam Silver implemented a rule where you can&rsquo;t rest players just because you want them to rest for the postseason, you know why? because every other team started to follow suit with the spurs</p>

<p>Spurs org was just one step ahead of everyone else</p>

<p>Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Tim Duncan were the only first picks in modern NBA history to have been drafted to a competitive team.</p>

<p>All other first picks fell to a lottery team as it was designed.</p>

<p>This is the case for Wemby - If Wemby was drafted to the Tim Duncan spurs, he&rsquo;d also have a first team all nba, and a post season already in his rookie season</p>

<p>But Wemby was drafted first pick, to a lottery team, AS IT WAS DESIGNED.</p>
