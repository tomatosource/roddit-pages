      <label for="l6zra29" class="commentText"><p>Michael Jordan put up 28.2p/6.5r/5.6a/2.4s/0.8b on 109 TS+ as a rookie. He came into the league and scored 28.2 ppg on 9% higher efficiency than league-average and also had 2.4 steals per game. I think we need to keep it real here. Who else could it possibly be? There are several MVP-winning seasons with worse statlines than this</p>

<p>For context the MVP of that season was Larry Bird, his statline was 28.7p/10.5r/6.6a and 1.6s/1.2b on 108 TS+. In his <em>rookie</em> season, MJ was 3rd in PPG in the league behind Bernard King and Larry Bird. He was 4th in SPG, 2nd in Win Shares, 3rd in Win Shares per 48, 2nd in BPM, 2nd in VORP&hellip;he was basically a top 3 player by his rookie season</p>

Both finished 6th in MVP voting, but the Bulls won 11 more games than the previous season, while the Spurs won 35 more. Robinson&rsquo;s advanced stats were generally better across the board as well (so were his counting stats). Of course, Robinson had the advantage of being 24 years old.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also put Tim Duncan&rsquo;s rookie year ahead of MJ&rsquo;s (Duncan finished 5th in MVP voting). MJ is probably third for me. You might be able to argue for Shaq, but I&rsquo;d go with MJ.</p>

<p>edit: MJ is third of the players I&rsquo;ve seen. Kareem is probably first in the history of the game.</p>

<p>You are excluding a lot of things when you say this. </p>

<p>First, they traded away Robertson, a multiple time All-Star (including 3 in a row before the trade), DPOY winner, and one of 4 players ever to record a quad double for Cummings. It’s not like they got Terry Cummings out of thin air. Robertson was actually the better player at the time of the trade (Cummings was just the better scorer). </p>

<p>As for Cheeks and Strickland, they didn’t have both on the roster at the same time. They were literally traded for each other mid season, so it isn’t like they had both but rather just either Cheeks or Strickland. </p>

<p>Their only real addition was David Robinson, a rookie Sean Elliott, and one of Cheeks/Strickland. Robinson was responsible for at least 25 of the 35 win improvement. </p>

<p>This is because they were traded for each other mid season. They were never on the team at the same time. Thus, when you add up their games, it amounts to around a combined full season (or a missed combined full season as you put it). </p>

<p>But going back before the 80s just legacy wise, Wes Unseld won league MVP in his rookie year. He averaged 13.8 points and 18.2 rebounds his rookie year and won both ROY and MVP.

There were better players than him then like Willis Reed and Bill Cunningham. He had better seasons immediately after, but was never considered a top player again until his body broke down.</p>

<p>Wilt would probably be a better fit here as he was the traditional definition of a dominant rookie and won MVP as a rookie as well.</p>

<p>Because the dude knows deep down that he wasted his talents. I know that&rsquo;s hard to believe for a guy with 4 rings, but Shaq should have been the undisputed GOAT with 9-12 rings and at least half a dozen MVPs. He was THAT dominant in his prime. He&rsquo;s bitter now because he realizes that if he had a work ethic, he would have achieved those things.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Shaq is one of the few elite players who never developed additional aspects of his game as he got more experienced. If anything, his game regressed after the 3-peat. He never developed a great midrange. He regressed as a playmaker. He never got decent at free throws. Most importantly, he should have been an all-time elite defender, but barely achieved anything notable on D.</p>

<p>Shaq relied completely on his size and strength. That was enough for awhile. But he coulda been A LOT more. He knows this and it causes all his insecurities. I say this as a huge Shaq fan who has had to reevaluate the career since we&rsquo;re all prone to only remembering guys in their prime and Shaq&rsquo;s prime was far too short.</p>

      <label for="l73go14" class="commentText"><p>I think that people define the term &ldquo;athletic&rdquo; differently than how people use the word. When you <em>ask</em> people what athleticism is, they bring in all sorts of dimensions - speed, strength, hops, coordination, body control, balance, etc.. But then in practice, people <em>label</em> players who are exceptionally explosive and can jump really high &ldquo;athletic&rdquo; and people who don&rsquo;t have a quick burst or a lot of airtime are called &ldquo;unathletic&rdquo; even if they have the other qualities in spades. As an example, this conversation happens endlessly around Luka (like in this very thread) where the popular perception is he&rsquo;s unathletic and then someone goes, &ldquo;Well aktually&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>We either need a new word to describe just explosiveness/hops, or a word that more broadly means &ldquo;good at a lot of the physical skills used in sports.&rdquo; Like this is not a debate about skills, it&rsquo;s a debate about semantics.</p>

      <label for="l70h4kp" class="commentText"><p>Haven’t you noticed that a large number of people on this sub will put both Magic &amp; Kareem in their top 5 all time, but somehow the guy that went toe to toe with them without a top 30 all time teammate gets relegated to the end of their top ten?</p>

<p>For 7 years Jordan couldn’t get deep in the playoffs because bird was there.</p>

<p>Birds career was cut a little bit short by back injury and the help that was suppose to light in his minutes load dying (Len Bias), and so a medium length career rather than extended is really the only knock on him.</p>

<p>His peak beats just about any player out there after Jordan.</p>

<p>Anyone that doesn’t have him in their top 5 is crazy.</p>

      <label for="l714d8w" class="commentText"><p>Those Celtics teams were absolutely stacked with great players. You can&rsquo;t just count the top two players and say that&rsquo;s a meaningful comparison. Kareem was also in his mid 30s to early 40s for most of Magic&rsquo;s career. He was 40 and 41 when the Lakers won their last two championships.</p>

<p>Kareem was awesome when Magic was there but it&rsquo;s not like their primes perfectly overlapped. Kareem was 13 years older. The closest you had to both of them in their primes was maybe 22 year old Magic and 35 year old Kareem. But Kareem&rsquo;s stats were already starting to diminish and Magic was still before his prime.</p>

<p>And most advanced stats don&rsquo;t place Bird in the top 5 - certainly not some obvious top 5 placement. Bird&rsquo;s numbers and efficiency also fell off in the playoffs which is a legitimate knock against him, especially if you&rsquo;re comparing him to the greatest ever.</p>

      <label for="l70j5y9" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s a little crazy to have him top 5, but the 5-13 or 14 range is very close. I think it’s pretty clear he doesn’t get past the Mt Rushmore of Bron, MJ, Bill, and Kareem, but he could sneak into the 5th spot. I’ve got Timmy above him there, but think those two, Magic and Shaq all have really good arguments to be top 5. Much easier to say he’s a clear top 10</p>

Magic&rsquo;s name gets mentioned more than Bird&rsquo;s. But Bird consistently gets mentioned as an arguably top 5-10 player by people who know basketball</p>

Pretty early on kids started watching his warm-ups before his games and getting super excited about him as he put on acrobatic displays. Within like 5 or 6 weeks of the start of the season, he appeared the cover of Sports Illustrated with the headline &ldquo;A Star is Born&rdquo;. In the pre-internet and ESPN TV days, Sports illustrated was huge and the main source of national sports news for a lot of people. He just exploded onto the scene</p>

<p>Magic &ndash; FMVP in rookie year</p>

<p>Jordan &ndash; 28 ppg as a rookie. Literally insane</p>

<p>Shaq &ndash; 24ppg and improved his team&rsquo;s record by 20 wins</p>

<p>DRobinson &ndash; 24ppg and team improved 25 wins his rookie year. He should have been MVP over Hakeem in 94.</p>

<p>Maybe not as good as the above but still amazing: Duncan &ndash; AllNBA first year</p>

<li><p>Duncan arrived won ring and was best player</p></li>

<li><p>Jordan the scoring being third in the league very efficient as well</p></li>

<li><p>Lebron high school to a dysfunctional team and killed it. Not quite the numbers as jordan but hes 18.</p></li>

<li><p>Wemby. Prisoner of moment? maybe. But ive never seen rookie actively shock other pros like that. Plus argument for dpoty</p></li>

<li><p>Luka.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Magics numbers and season werent all that great he was good but he wasnt standout. He had the memorable game in the finals tho.</p>

      <label for="l7120n3" class="commentText"><p>Magic&rsquo;s rookie season was great but always a bit overrated. 18/8/7 on solid shooting and okay defense. 12th in PER and 12th in Win Shares. He rightfully got 2nd to Bird in Rookie of the Year.</p>

<p>He got FMVP but Kareem absolutely carried the team and got robbed of the award. Kareem had 33/14/3 with 5 blocks and great overall defense. Magic was 21/11/9 and not as dominant a defender. Kareem got hurt the last game and was generally disliked by the media, so they handed it Magic.</p>

<p>Obviously great for a rookie but I don&rsquo;t think it was the greatest ever performance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d put MJ, Duncan, David Robinson, Shaq and Bird all higher. Also Kareem if you go back a little.</p>

<p>MJ is just leaps and bounds above everyone at everything in basketball</p>

<p>Yea, I know there are really good big men, but the best big man is debatable</p>

<p>Lebron is the best small forward of all time, but a lot of people will debate this because of his personality</p>

<p>Nobody will debate that MJ is the best 2 guard of all time</p>

<p>Every position is debatable in who is the best, but shooting guard</p>

<p>MJ is the answer, including his rookie season. He just clearly stuck out with his talent, demeanor, and stats</p>

      <label for="l72a5e9" class="commentText"><p>On a per 36 minute basis Wemby easily. On a per 36 minute basis he averages these insane numbers:</p>

<p>Points: 25.9 to Jordan&rsquo;s 26.5
Rebounds: 12.8 to Shaq 13.2
Assists: 4.7 to Luka 6.7
Blocks: 4.5 to Robinson&rsquo;s 3.8
Steals: 1.5 to Jordan&rsquo;s 2.3</p>

<p>So on a per 36 minute basis you have a player who as a rookie scored almost as much as rookie Jordan, rebounded almost as much as rookie Shaq, only 2 assist behind rookie Luka, in a league of his own blocking and within 1 steal of Jordan.</p>

<p>When Wemby starts playing 36 minutes per game it&rsquo;s going to be insane watching his numbers.</p>

      <label for="l736z5i" class="commentText"><p>Frankly, way too many people are choosing Jordan based on ppgz and reputation and not looking at the guy in his own class who was arguably a better rookie&hellip;Hakeem!</p>

<p>In 1985, the Rockets retained most of their minutes leaders. 33 yr old Caldwell Jones, 2 yrs removed from being b2b All-D 1st team, left the team and was replaced by Hakeem. The result? A +4.5 jump in SRS, +19 wins, team defense improved by 2.2 points (from 17th in the league to 4th), and the team offense improved by 2.3 points (19th to 12th).</p>

<p>Comparatively, the Bulls also retained most of their minutes leaders as well. Their jump was +4.2 in SRS, +11 wins, team offense improved by 6 (!) points (22nd to 11th) but the team defense regressed by 1.8 points (10th to 20th).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very close. And if factoring in playoffs, Jordan probably takes the cake. But he was not the best in history by a huge margin when there&rsquo;s an equal the very same year.</p>
