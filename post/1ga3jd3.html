<p>Soccer, football, basketball, volleyball - it’s very common in every single sport.</p>

<p>It can be massively detrimental in certain sports - like soccer - where a lack of power in your kicks from a life of using flat balls will be evident almost immediately. I bet a lot of you have played a bit of soccer in your life and then watched it and you’re impressed by the keeper kicking it as far as they can.</p>

<p>You’re just kicking flat balls all the time so your power and technique are fucked from it.</p>

      <label for="ltblmlu" class="commentText"><p>It’s definitely not a great idea for everyone or for every sport.</p>

<p>If you’re just playing half court ball with your boys in a local park, why pump the ball? Just so every pass is a risk of a stubbed finger ruining the next 2 months for a blue collar worker? Now mans can’t even enjoy his time off playing video games. There’s really no reason to.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to play sports for a scholarship or professionally, you should pump your balls. Train as you play is the best advice any aspiring athlete can hear.</p>

<p>Like, I’ve seen otherwise talented kids who dream of playing soccer professionally who can’t kick a ball properly by 14 because nobody around them has ever forced them to step up to “real” balls.</p>

<p>Now that’s an issue. Adjust based on your goals and surroundings.</p>

<p>I play a lot of pickup in the city. I always bring one properly pumped ball to warm up with alone, and one under pumped ball that I pull out for pickup just because I know how mans are.</p>

<p>Also, I have quite literally dozens, if not hundreds, of examples of some random dude at the park touching my ball for the first time and being like “dude this thing is a rock” which leads me to have a conversation about it which eventually leads to me encouraging them to shoot it.</p>

<p>Next thing you know, my pump is out of my bag and I’m pumping their ball.</p>

Some say a fully aired ball hurts their foot or touch, but it’s mostly just because they’re not used to a real ball. Having it under inflated means the ball has more “give” when your foot makes contact, reducing the power transfer from leg to foot to ball.</p>

<p>My Sunday adult league team is always rolling out under inflated balls. Drives me nuts, as someone who played college soccer years ago.</p>

      <label for="ltc07xy" class="commentText"><p>Actually, they’re sent to China where kids in elementary schools bounce them in unison for 8 hours a day over the span of 2 months, via the Yao Ming foundation, before they are shipped to Florida. Once there, they are placed on a spacecraft and complete 2 full orbits around the edges of Earth’s ice wall. Upon reentry they are loaded onto an unmanned Cyber truck which may or may not make it to the Orlando Magic facility.</p>

<p>If the balls complete the trip to the facility they are then loaded into the “bounce machine” which proceeds to bounce the balls for 6 days straight until Adam Driver drives Adam Silver to the stadium where he and Adam Sandler put a single grain of sand and a microscopic piece of silver into each one. Then Adam (Silver) personally dunks every ball one time. This is both to test the balls viscosity as well as its propensity. And because Adam (Silver) says it’s fun.</p>

<p>Three months later, once the Cyber truck is out of the shop and back in service, the Adams’ hop in and head East towards Adam West’s house. Once there they meet Tom Brady for dinner whom inspects each ball’s air pressure with a tire gauge. If the balls are too buoyant then air is let out to his liking. Finally, after receiving their spice melange via a reverse enema, all four Adam’s put the finishing touches on the balls by giving them a little kiss and a whisper of sweet nothings.</p>

<p>Yea the life of a basketball is quite unique but it’s the only way to ensure the integrity of the game we have all come to know and love. I know this all doesn’t sound right but believe you me, this is, in fact, how the fate of our league is decided. Now the WNBA is completely different so don’t even get me started there cuz trust me, you don’t wanna hear how those balls are birthed.</p>

      <label for="ltcmch1" class="commentText"><p>while this may be a meme, the process for getting baseballs ready for MLB games is nearly this comical and absurd.</p>

<p>Besides being kept in special humidors for a minimum of 14 days before the scheduled game (which must be verified and certified in a signed form by the clubhouse manager and &ldquo;gameday compliance monitor&rdquo;), the balls are required to be rubbed down with mud (yes, actual mud) on their day of use.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t just your standard, run-of-the-mill, backyard mud either. It&rsquo;s harvested from a secret location on the Delaware River, by one guy/family (Jim Bintliff), who&rsquo;s been collecting it for generations. This specific mud has been used to make baseballs less slippery since the 1930&rsquo;s, when it was discovered by &ldquo;Lena&rdquo; Blackburne, a coach for the Philadelphia A&rsquo;s. Before he died, he passed his mud-knowledge over to the Bintliff family, and nearly 100 years later they&rsquo;re still out there digging up mud for the MLB.</p>

<p>instead of just like, you know, making the balls less slippery in general lmao</p>

I’ve already written a letter to the Lakers and we’re looking into it. There’s no place for this sort of recklessness in any workplace and that includes the NBA. I will keep all parties updates on our public notices section and we’ll be testing the Gatorade at an NRTL for further analysis. These people have no idea who they’ve fucked with. We are OSHA. We do not forget. We do not forgive. We are legion.</p>

      <label for="ltayryy" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s completely different in the NBA. NBA balls are real leather. They are very slippery and hard when they are new. After they are made, they are put into a bounce machine to help wear them in. Then they are sent to the G League practice facility before they are sent to the NBA for game use</p>

<p> It&rsquo;s much worse playing with a new leather ball than a Evo or something </p>

<p>Wisconsin under Bo Ryan used this really obscure basketball b/c he was loyal to the company for sponsoring his D3 team, so B1G teams had a stash of those balls that they passed around to each other for prepping to play at Wisconsin.</p>

      <label for="ltckwgv" class="commentText"><p>Yeah they seams were different but the surface was also a different material that gave a lot more grip. If you go back and watch clips of Chris Paul from that season it’s kinda crazy what he was doing with the improved friction dribble wise, stuff you couldn’t do with the balls they use now. However, the surface at a micro level was basically like shards of glass and so players skin would get absolutely shredded playing back to back games.</p>

      <label for="ltc305g" class="commentText"><p>The funniest thing about that game was the final score was 45-7. LaGarret Blount ran for 150 yards and 3 tds. Brady only had 220 yards passing.</p>

<p>The ball being deflated didn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p>

      <label for="ltazac6" class="commentText"><p> It&rsquo;s so much worse with nba balls too since they are genuine leather. It takes like 6 months of daily use to break in a real leather ball. It&rsquo;s why the NBA normally sends the balls to the G League practice facility before they are sent to the NBA for game use </p>
