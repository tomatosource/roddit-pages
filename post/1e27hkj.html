      <label for="lcz4ma4" class="commentText"><p>Applying for a DPE allows the Nuggets to at least sign someone to a minimum. They need depth all over and this is a huge loss for them. Saric was ahead of him on the depth chart but Daron could&rsquo;ve squeezed Nnaji out&mdash;brings some similar skills to the table but at a higher level&hellip;more grit, bigger, more awareness, and shot <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> from 3 last night before the injury.</p>

<p>Daron&rsquo;s fluidity is a major part of his game, really hope he doesn&rsquo;t lose anything athletically from this. That&rsquo;s a major part of his game. Nuggets will apply for a DPE surely just to not have a roster spot tied down with someone who can&rsquo;t play, but they&rsquo;re even thinner now than they were going into last night.</p>

<p>I do believe in Dario&rsquo;s fit with this roster. I think Dario will be a great fit in Denver, and he has looked good with Croatia, but unless an addition is made, looks like they may again have to hope Nnaji pulls it together or slide Cancar into the rotation after the ACL.</p>

<p>Shit happens and he wasnt a bad pick. Maybe in the future he ends up being great, but for now its looking like a wasted pick.</p>

Unless they trade one of Murray/MPJ for multiple depth pieces, there really isn’t much else they can do. Letting KCP walk in their situation was a bit weird, but that may have also come from the top due to the luxury tax.</p>

<p>Kings got significantly better, Mavs made moves, OKC made moves, Wolves did some things, and the Nuggets are just hoping and praying that Peyton Watson and Christian Braun made significant jumps? That ain&rsquo;t gonna cut it.</p>

      <label for="ld06937" class="commentText"><p>What the hell did you guys do lol. Like no seriously what did you giys actually do to make your roster better.</p>

<p>Mavs got Klay&hellip;which i dunno if its an actual upgrade. The Kings fit remains to be seen.</p>

<p>But Jesus i knew the Thunder front office was good&hellip;but even then they still managed to one up my expectations. That Giddey trade is an incredible steal.</p>

<p>As for Watson and Braun&hellip;well the Braun jump seems very realistic if you actually followed his game for a longer period of time and Watson has insane potential. Still insane potential doesnt mean its gonna be achieved and we really did need something more guranteed.</p>

<p>That said it would have required moving MPJ, whoch im guessing Booth probably didnt want or wasnt allowed to do anything with. That and he also probably didnt get good enough offers to trade him.</p>

<p>Remember MPJ is still one of the beat 3 point shooters in the league and you will have a hard time finding a 3 that rebounds as well as him, but he aint Max contract level good.</p>

<p>But i so fear the Lakers now with Bronny. Hes like a Lebron jr. Scary shit man.</p>

      <label for="ld0q6a0" class="commentText"><p>Considering our limitations with the second apron we had a huge off-season.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Replaced Kyle Anderson who played himself to the bench with Jingles, who is similar but shoots far better (worse on defense but neither were good), plus he&rsquo;s a great culture guy who played most of his career with Conley and Gobert.</p></li>

<li><p>Picked up Dozier who is more of a question mark, but used to be a top tier defender pre injury so lots of potential there in terms of keeping up the defensive pressure with the bench unit out.</p></li>

<li><p>Traded up to get Dillinguam, who will be our point guard of the future if he pans out, adds playmaking (and will learn to do it better under Conley), provides lots of energy off the bench where he&rsquo;ll at least start the season, supposedly a really positive culture guy too.</p></li>

<li><p>Managed to get one of the most NBA-ready players in the draft with the <strong>27th</strong> pick in Terrence Shannon Jr., which as a win now team is perfect and a major steal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Our top 7 were stellar last year and we had limited flexibility this off-season, but we managed to keep all of them and still managed to pick up 4 guys with lots of upside to fight for the 8th and 9th spot, with any one of them on the level that they could potentially move into our top 7 this year. It&rsquo;s been a great off-season if you follow the wolves.</p>

      <label for="ld0o8ao" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, but Joe Ingles is a decent vet replacement. Anderson’s lack of shooting was kinda killing them in the playoffs.</p>

<p>They have promising Forward prospects like Terrance Shannon Jr and Leonard Miller.</p>

      <label for="ld0oale" class="commentText"><p>So the bet is on a rookie PG, the position that has by far the highest learning curve of them all.</p>

<p>And for a team whose offense lives and dies for based on whether guys step up on any given day, somehow i dont think the Timberwolves should really be anymore confident than the Nuggets lol.</p>

<p>I thought they would prioritize finding a wing to replace KCP.</p>

      <label for="ld04we9" class="commentText"><p>Not KCP, but Braun. We need someone to replace Brauns minutes n the bench, not KCPs cause Braun was always gonna be KCPs replacment.</p>

<p>And trust me, Booth is incapable of getting actual centers. His belief is that big men are all centers.</p>

<p>People always say this, yet I don&rsquo;t think this is true. I feel like serviceable reliable bigs are pretty hard to find.</p>

<p>Wait&hellip; Did he play last season? I don&rsquo;t remember him on the Nuggets. Then again I don&rsquo;t remember what I wore yesterday.</p>

<p>No, he was drafted last month. The Nuggets traded for him.</p>

<p>I think the wording is weird but what he means is the nuggets figured to rely more on their “depth” not rely more on Holmes</p>
