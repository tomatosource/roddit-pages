    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As a Diehard Raptors fan mine is the 2013 season where we traded Rudy gay halfway through the season and we became elite with Grieves Vasquez, Patrick Patterson, and the boys. The team was so shocking up until that trade and it shifted the franchise forever. Ever since that season we’ve been one of the most winning franchises and made the playoffs almost every year. Also another favourite moment would be game 1 against the Brooklyn nets that same year. It was the first time in the playoffs in a minute and my first time after I had become a fan. Felt surreal and I was hyped the entire time. We lost that game but man it was a different level a hype. The team was so gritty and unselfish. Was nice seeing that after Rudy gay iso bricks for a couple years lmao</p>

      <label for="liioa41" class="commentText"><p>Revenge on Celtics in 2010. Historic NBA rivalry, a game 7 finals, Kobe getting his 5th to pass Shaq. That was the peak of being an early 90s-born Lakers fan who grew up watching 00s ball.</p>

<p>And while it’s always fuck the Celtics, 2008 and 2010 were finals of (I like to think) mutual respect as much as they were of hostility. Two great teams featuring some legends of the previous decade.</p>

      <label for="liioszr" class="commentText"><p>That game and whole series really was like theater. Lakers coming out looking strong as hell in game 1, Ray spoiling their spirited comeback in game 2, Fisher having his veteran moment in a grind-it-out game 3, Celtics&rsquo; bench/roleplayers carrying in 4 and 5, revenge of the Lakers&rsquo; roleplayers in game 6&hellip;</p>

<p>And then yeah, just an epic game 7. It was ugly as hell, which kind of added to the epicness. Kobe having such a sloppy game but still doing the dirty work with double-digit rebounds while Artest and Pau brought the team home was such a twist.</p>

      <label for="liiobtg" class="commentText"><p>The actual winning moment in 2021 is pretty hard to top. I&rsquo;ve seen so many teams have that exact moment where the opposing team is down like 5-9 points and they hoist up a 3, and if they make it, idk maybe they foul and continue to extend the game, but if they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll let it go. Seeing Tucker get that rebound and just dribble it into the front court while the rest of the team starts to high-five and hug behind him&hellip; Just the fact that it was finally our turn to have that happen was amazing.</p>

<p>But, the moment of winning a championship feels like kind of a lame/predictable answer. I think I&rsquo;d also pick Giannis&rsquo;s block on Ayton in game 4, because I had the fortune of being there live for that and I literally said during that play &ldquo;Oh shit, that&rsquo;s gonna&rsquo; be a lob&hellip; *brief pause* wait, did he block that? Did he actually block that clean!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another honorable mention that may seem super insignificant to most folks is Jrue&rsquo;s game-winner against Memphis in the regular season of 2020-21. I&rsquo;d been begging the gods for us to trade for Jrue for years, and we finally did, and then that felt like the moment of validation where all my friends also got on board with him.</p>

      <label for="liipu4o" class="commentText"><p>I have two, both related to having season tickets.  The first one wasn&rsquo;t at an NBA game; the second was.</p>

<p>(1) 2019, the team invited season ticket holders to come cheer for the Special Olympics Colorado kids as they did some training exercises and then some of them played mini-games. I&rsquo;m a full-time stay-at-home dad with, at the time, a 2 year old (he&rsquo;s now 7 and sitting one computer over from me playing Minecraft.) So I was like &hellip; OK, this seems like fun, I&rsquo;ll ride the train down there with the little guy and we can have a good time. There was a fluke snowstorm that day, and a lot of the youngest kids&rsquo; families cancelled, so the organizers were like &ldquo;hey bring your kid in to the group and he can participate.&rdquo;  So he joined the youngest kids, and sort of semi-participated-ish with me guiding him around.  At one point while I think Plumdog was showing the kids defensive stances, Jokic came up from the back of the group and picked up my kid and held him up high and told him a joke.  And then a little while later Jokic threw him a lob on a plastic mini-hoop.  (The team videographer caught part of the first, and all of the second, interaction on camera.)</p>

<p>(2) My mom has been a fan for a long, long time &ndash; she remembers listening to games on the radio when Byron Beck was playing (67-77).  I took her to finals game 5.  The moment KCP had that last rebound in hand and it was clear the Heat weren&rsquo;t going to foul, and the whole stadium erupted and my mom was crying and singing &ldquo;We Are The Champions&rdquo; &hellip; that was the best in-game moment.  Yeah, I know, &ldquo;the time my team won the title&rdquo; seems cheap, but &ldquo;&hellip; and I took my mom to the game&rdquo; is what makes it over the top for me.</p>
