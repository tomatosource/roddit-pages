    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As a Diehard Raptors fan mine is the 2013 season where we traded Rudy gay halfway through the season and we became elite with Grieves Vasquez, Patrick Patterson, and the boys. The team was so shocking up until that trade and it shifted the franchise forever. Ever since that season we’ve been one of the most winning franchises and made the playoffs almost every year. Also another favourite moment would be game 1 against the Brooklyn nets that same year. It was the first time in the playoffs in a minute and my first time after I had become a fan. Felt surreal and I was hyped the entire time. We lost that game but man it was a different level a hype. The team was so gritty and unselfish. Was nice seeing that after Rudy gay iso bricks for a couple years lmao</p>

<p>But if Kawhi hadn’t hit the shot I think we’d have lost to Philly in OT. They (mainly Jimmy Butler) had the momentum and were shredding the defense in the last couple of minutes of the 4th. Also, Marc Gasol was the true hero of that series with how he shut down Embid.</p>

Even as a relative neutral (I liked the Spurs mostly &lsquo;cause Manu was my favorite player at the time but didn&rsquo;t actually have an attachment to the team), that 2013 series was devastating. That run the Spurs had in the 3rd quarter of game 5 where Mills and Manu hit three straight 3s to essentially ice the game&hellip; That shit had to bring some tears to some eyes for y&rsquo;all I imagine.</p>

Having their last finals appearance be a heartbreaker would’ve left a dark cloud hanging around. Luckily things worked out.</p>

<p>Those daggers are what I think of first when I reminisce about that series.</p>

      <label for="liipu4o" class="commentText"><p>I have two, both related to having season tickets.  The first one wasn&rsquo;t at an NBA game; the second was.</p>

<p>(1) 2019, the team invited season ticket holders to come cheer for the Special Olympics Colorado kids as they did some training exercises and then some of them played mini-games. I&rsquo;m a full-time stay-at-home dad with, at the time, a 2 year old (he&rsquo;s now 7 and sitting one computer over from me playing Minecraft.) So I was like &hellip; OK, this seems like fun, I&rsquo;ll ride the train down there with the little guy and we can have a good time. There was a fluke snowstorm that day, and a lot of the youngest kids&rsquo; families cancelled, so the organizers were like &ldquo;hey bring your kid in to the group and he can participate.&rdquo;  So he joined the youngest kids, and sort of semi-participated-ish with me guiding him around.  At one point while I think Plumdog was showing the kids defensive stances, Jokic came up from the back of the group and picked up my kid and held him up high and told him a joke.  And then a little while later Jokic threw him a lob on a plastic mini-hoop.  (The team videographer caught part of the first, and all of the second, interaction on camera.)</p>

<p>(2) My mom has been a fan for a long, long time &ndash; she remembers listening to games on the radio when Byron Beck was playing (67-77).  I took her to finals game 5.  The moment KCP had that last rebound in hand and it was clear the Heat weren&rsquo;t going to foul, and the whole stadium erupted and my mom was crying and singing &ldquo;We Are The Champions&rdquo; &hellip; that was the best in-game moment.  Yeah, I know, &ldquo;the time my team won the title&rdquo; seems cheap, but &ldquo;&hellip; and I took my mom to the game&rdquo; is what makes it over the top for me.</p>

<p>And while it’s always fuck the Celtics, 2008 and 2010 were finals of (I like to think) mutual respect as much as they were of hostility. Two great teams featuring some legends of the previous decade.</p>

      <label for="liioszr" class="commentText"><p>That game and whole series really was like theater. Lakers coming out looking strong as hell in game 1, Ray spoiling their spirited comeback in game 2, Fisher having his veteran moment in a grind-it-out game 3, Celtics&rsquo; bench/roleplayers carrying in 4 and 5, revenge of the Lakers&rsquo; roleplayers in game 6&hellip;</p>

<p>And then yeah, just an epic game 7. It was ugly as hell, which kind of added to the epicness. Kobe having such a sloppy game but still doing the dirty work with double-digit rebounds while Artest and Pau brought the team home was such a twist.</p>

      <label for="liiobtg" class="commentText"><p>The actual winning moment in 2021 is pretty hard to top. I&rsquo;ve seen so many teams have that exact moment where the opposing team is down like 5-9 points and they hoist up a 3, and if they make it, idk maybe they foul and continue to extend the game, but if they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll let it go. Seeing Tucker get that rebound and just dribble it into the front court while the rest of the team starts to high-five and hug behind him&hellip; Just the fact that it was finally our turn to have that happen was amazing.</p>

<p>But, the moment of winning a championship feels like kind of a lame/predictable answer. I think I&rsquo;d also pick Giannis&rsquo;s block on Ayton in game 4, because I had the fortune of being there live for that and I literally said during that play &ldquo;Oh shit, that&rsquo;s gonna&rsquo; be a lob&hellip; *brief pause* wait, did he block that? Did he actually block that clean!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another honorable mention that may seem super insignificant to most folks is Jrue&rsquo;s game-winner against Memphis in the regular season of 2020-21. I&rsquo;d been begging the gods for us to trade for Jrue for years, and we finally did, and then that felt like the moment of validation where all my friends also got on board with him.</p>

        <div>1 | 2 hours ago </div>
      </div>
      <label for="liiqqb1" class="commentText"><p>The Nuggets run in 2023.  All the in-season nonsense about the the Embiid vs. Jokic debate.  Seeing Embiid win the regular season MVP after all the controversy and then Jokic calmly leading the Nuggets to their first ever championship and winning finals MVP as Embiid bowed out in the second round again will forever be cherry on top.</p>

<p>The Nuggets have been viewed for decades like many fellow mid market franchises as a team that merely exists because larger market franchises need someone to play on their way to another title.  We rarely are able to make an impact in free agency as top tier free agents almost never wanted to play here.  National media rarely talked about us, local media shit on us for decades.  In the 1990s we were bought and sold multiple times by ownership groups who wanted nothing to do with us and the results showed on the court, bottoming out with an 11 win season in 1997-1998 and we nearly lost the team until a last minute investment to get what is now called Ball Arena built at the time.</p>

<p>Finally, after yet another 20 something win season in 2002-2003, we were tied with Cleveland in the draft lottery with LeBron James set to go #1.  Our closest chance to draft a franchise changing player since David Thompson.  We got #3 and it was pure dumb luck that Joe Dumars took Darko #2 because GM Kiki Vandewheghe was set to draft him over Carmelo.</p>

<p>Carmelo instantly turned us into a perennial playoff team, but the writing on the wall was there.  He wasn&rsquo;t going to lead us to the promised land.  7 first round exits in 8 seasons and then his demand to be traded.  We had our one run to the WCF in 2009, our deepest playoff run in 25 years but yet Kobe and Pau&rsquo;s Lakers were too good.  The following season Denver came back and was near the top of the Western Conference.  Then George Karl misses the remainder of the season due to his second bout with cancer in his Denver tenure, another first round exit and then Carmelo demanding a trade that summer.</p>

<p>Carmelo&rsquo;s exit 9 months later left a bitter taste in the mouths of long time Denver fans and many (including myself).  However only 3 years later, Jokic is drafted, and the rest as they say is history.</p>

<p>Before the Nuggets won in 2023 they had a record for the most post season appearances for a franchise without a championship in the 4 major sports (MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL).  There was a NYT article about it in 2023.</p>

<p>Even in Denver, the Nuggets have been shit on by the local news media coverage as even a 5 win Broncos team or a 60 win Rockies team will garner more air time than anything the Nuggets have accomplished.</p>

<p>This is an inelegant way of saying, forgive us r/NBA, we Nuggets fans can be salty because damnit the chip on our shoulder is the size of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>I would say my second favorite is the 1993-1994 team that upset the Sonics.  Best playoff series I&rsquo;ve ever seen to this day.  A lot of people forget those same Nuggets nearly did the same to the Utah Jazz in the next round, taking them to 7 games.</p>
