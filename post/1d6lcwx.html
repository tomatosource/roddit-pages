In his 22 season. For a player who has more minutes on his body than any other in history. For whom physicality is a large part of their game. It&rsquo;s beyond ridiculous. It&rsquo;s unheard of in any sport.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re playing at an all NBA level with a career longer than rookies are older, it&rsquo;s bonkers.</p>

      <label for="l6whinm" class="commentText"><p>A lot of it must come down to physique. He&rsquo;s been able to maintain a nearly perfect balance of having enough muscle mass to be incredibly strong, but not so much that it overloads his body ala Zion. His strength probably helps with joint stability, and he had so much athleticism to spare that he has lost a step but matured into an oldman game beautifully. Lebron is in the conversation for being the most all around athletic person ever, so I&rsquo;m not sure thats something that can be easily replicated. </p>

<p>Hes also avoided soft muscle injuries throughout his career though. How hes managed to do that might be a worthwhile case study. </p>

      <label for="l6wicss" class="commentText"><p>Agree with everything you’ve said. Also adding his bio mechanics are incredibly sound. He doesn’t land on his feet awkwardly, doesn’t run with any discernible favoring of a leg, consistently has his weight above his hips, and falls to the ground in a very considered and controlled manner. He’s been doing this since he was a rookie, and it’s a huge skill that gets overlooked</p>

      <label for="l6uspwt" class="commentText"><p>LeBron&rsquo;s still more than a season&rsquo;s worth of games away from breaking Robert Parish&rsquo;s games played record. Parish averaged 78.4 games over his first 20 regular seasons, and TIL he played 74 games and started 34 for the 95-96 Hornets. Parish certainly doesn&rsquo;t come close to LeBron&rsquo;s productivity, but also played 4 years of college ball, (and lots of playoff games as well) so LeBron has some more youthful years as he crosses the 20 year mark.</p>

He has 16 seasons of playing 82 games, one of the seasons he couldn&rsquo;t because the season was shortened, so that one and two other seasons (64 and 78) are the only seasons he didn&rsquo;t play every game. Played 113 more regular season games than Kidd in the same amount of seasons, and 24 more playoff games.</p>

In his 8 straight finals run, if you count all his playoff minutes there&rsquo;s two full seasons worth of basketball. And that&rsquo;s not even counting that in the final year of that run he played all 82 games before going into one of the most dominant playoffs runs ever. I think the man has earned his rest.</p>

Instead of using 82 games as a season, if you only used 65 or 70, LeBron would have more like 4.1 - 4.4 seasons worth of playoff games played.</p>

However, he disagreed when I said (cant remember the guy) someone who had a 10ish year career as like the 7th guy in the rotation is still better than even 75% of nba players in history. Just playing 15 mins a night for a decade in the nba is a major major accomplishment for pro basketball players</p>

<p>I’ll look at 2007-2016 because I feel like that’s the start of the modern era of draft classes and the first year where the median first round pick isn’t playing anymore</p>

<p>Edit: Median for seasons is 8, Median for games it’s 470-490 somewhere hard to determine because there are active players under the median</p>

      <label for="l6tzyfc" class="commentText"><p>In years it’s 8 years</p>

<p>In games it’s about 470</p>

<p>This is a median</p>

<p>This is slightly impacted by some active players being slightly under the median but it’s only like 5-10 players who have missed time to injury or came over from Europe later</p>

<p>Like Kristaps, Embiid, Jamal Murray, Dejaunte Murray, Bojan, and Ben Simmons</p>

<p>So I am guessing the median is like 480 games for a first round pick</p>

<p>570-600 games</p>

<p>With the sample I used those numbers are a bit more questionable because I used a year (2015, 2016) that was below the average so they haven’t had time yet to set the average, like Jaylen brow, myles Turner, DRuss and KAt are all right around the “Average”</p>

<p>It could honestly be as high as like 650 games 11 years once everything ends up shaking out</p>

<p>The question is whether he wants to&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one question, above everything else, is simply whether his back ultimately recovers from the surgery.  That, and whether it holds up, if so.</p>

<p>As we saw last year, when he&rsquo;s healthy, his per-36 numbers average a skinny-3D.  Plus, he&rsquo;s still a very good, versatile defender, and adds fairly unique, fast playmaking skills.</p>

<p>Sadly, I&rsquo;m skeptical that his back will ever fully recover, but the guy&rsquo;s a beast when healthy&hellip; even when it&rsquo;s completely obvious he&rsquo;s playing to protect his back or knees.  FWIW.</p>

      <label for="l6tpudh" class="commentText"><p>Well, notice my flair.</p>

<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t really Simmons&rsquo; decisively recovering or not.  The open-endedness and ongoing frustration of the situation is that at times he seems almost fully recovered, and at other times, it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s back to square one.</p>

<p>As long as he&rsquo;s in that kind of stasis, then most teams in future would be smart to give him the minimum (or a little more) just for his healthy periods, even as unpredictable as his health is.</p>

<p>The situation isn&rsquo;t without precedent either.  Brook Lopez for example went through years of operations, long layoffs and general uncertainty about his foot health before eventually becoming solid as a rock in that way.  Todd McCullough, not so much.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just no predicting this stuff, sometimes.</p>

      <label for="l6u5344" class="commentText"><p>This subreddit is so weird about Ben Simmons.</p>

<p>They were convinced he was &ldquo;faking it&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t actually have any back issues when he was playing poorly, and he had his family accuse eachother of sexual assault while he&rsquo;s trying to rehab.</p>

<p>Couple surgeries later Redditors can&rsquo;t accept they were wrong about whether he was injured, so now they just lay it on thick about how little he &ldquo;cared&rdquo; and how &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; he was. For what? Breaking his back? He was All-NBA when he was healthy.</p>

<p>The only reason this guy still gets dogged on is the hubris of R/NBA and being unable to admit they were wrong, which is crazy.</p>

I don’t think players leave in one fell swoop. It’s probably more of a slow churn where a guy goes from having a roster spot, to roster churn guy, to playing outside the league. And some of the FRPs go to the G-League, play overseas for a few years, etc…</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only 450 NBA roster spots and 60 guys come into the league every year. A lot of these guys aren&rsquo;t awful, they&rsquo;re just mediocre and teams would rather give the roster spot to a 22yo on a rookie deal than a 27yo.</p>

      <label for="l6v4th9" class="commentText"><p>Most NFL players are too short. The ones that could are guys like Lamar that are athletic enough to probably make it work. All the tall NFL players are huge linemen, but they are also like 300lbs. Doubt a 6’-8” 300lb LT could keep up with a 6’-8” 230lb SF. They would get run off the court.</p>

<p>The opposite is true though. Many NBA players would probably do really well in the NFL. And it’s been proven with guys like Gates and Graham who played at an All-Pro level despite never playing college football but playing college B-ball and not being good enough for the NBA. Although Gates could have made the NBA if he were like 3-4” taller, he was very good in college.</p>

<p>Edit: Graham did play one year of football in college.</p>

<p>Simmons is not the consensus #1 anymore (although some may still put him up there). Would it be Brown, Ingram, Sabonis or Siakam?  All of them (except Ingram) have been an all-NBA selection. And Siakam (and now Brown) have shown themselves to be capable of playing amazing in the playoffs (although both would be #2s).</p>

      <label for="l6t67gw" class="commentText"><p>The problem is players actually try to do that and then become washed players with no tools that an NBA team can actually use. If they tried to focus on the less flashy skills like defense, rebounding, shooting, even being a good locker room presence, they would maybe able to find a spot in the league.</p>

<p>Most people don’t realize that after the top 25-30 players (depending on the season there is quite a lot of talent in the league right now) there’s a big drop off. The remaining 250 players in the league are a combination of role players that found a niche skill that can keep them in the league, vets that are kept around for the locker room presence or just to run out contracts that were given to them when they were good.</p>

<p>When you spend your entire upbringing being your hometowns or even home state’s version of Lebron it’s hard to get to the NBA and become Luke Kornet. However if you’re tryna make a bag you take a step back and focus on the parts of your game that a team can use.</p>

      <label for="l6tjb7a" class="commentText"><p>But at the same time, is it?</p>

<p>Yes, OP is saying <em>just</em> be a great role player and focus on role player things. The guy you are replying to exaggerates with superstars as a joke.</p>

<p>But OP is seriously underrating the only two examples he used. Caruso is an elite athlete and is a toolsy player with fantastic defensive awareness, but he is limited due to his size and isn’t a creator. We all know why he used Caruso as an example and example as someone who doesn’t have the tools. Whiteside is an even more egregious example and is a better example of someone who should have embraced the role player side. There isn’t a single person on that list more talented than Whiteside.</p>

<p>Most those guys just couldn’t cut it, it wasn’t there decision to refuse being a role player. Wade Baldwin played pretty good on-ball defense, he just wasn’t elite enough to carry his other weaknesses.</p>

<p>Chriss was never a good basketball player. Not even in college, just a great athlete. He didn’t have the technique or awareness or skills to become a good player.</p>

<p>I could go on and on, but the idea of “they could have just been Hassan Whiteside or Caruso if they had half a brain” is a brain dead take.</p>
