You give your bookie an envelope with some cash in it and tell him you want the Under on steals that night. Then you&rsquo;re carefully watching the game on TV, counting the steals in your head, and after the game you see the box score shows x2 what you thought it was lol.</p>

I can usually find what the box score tells me happened (though I haven&rsquo;t worked with much pertaining to Jordan blocks and steals).</p>

<p>One of the biggest examples of statistics <em>not</em> holding up in my experience is a Celtics-Bucks playoff game from 1983 that supposedly featured 29 blocked shots between the two teams. In that case, the only way I could get to 29 was to count blocked shots that occurred during fouls, which I don&rsquo;t think was ever an official way to count a blocked shot.</p>

      <label for="l9mjsao" class="commentText"><p>People gonna hate but the story is actually insane. 4 steals per game and 2 blocks per game at home. 2 steals per game and 1 block per game away.</p>

<p>At home they have evidence of a game where the Hawks had 10 TOs total and 10 steals credited to the Bulls, which meant the Hawks never committed an offensive foul, traveled, or threw the ball out of bounds. Instantly they saw many times the ball did go out, they counted 2 steals and MJ ended with 5 on the stat sheet. Many times they believe balls tipped by Jordan that went back to the Hawks, were credited to MJ with no change of possession.</p>

<p>The NBA never confirmed his stats (nor did they care). These stat inflations go further than MJ, Wilt and Bill Russell were credited with 26 40+ rebound games, all 26 were credited at Home.</p>

Their respective teams traded accusations that the opposing scorekeeper padded the stats to help their giant. Looking back, the numbers are indeed startling. Between them, Russell and Chamberlain registered 26 games with 40-plus rebounds. None of the 26 games were tabulated on the road, per Stathead.com tracking</p>

The NBA didn’t care due to stars bringing more viewership and money to the league. Obviously these are all still all-time greats, but some records may never truly be broken and we can’t validate how much they were inflated (if they were).</p>

      <label for="l9mvg66" class="commentText"><p>It would have been very easy to do for Rondo. He liked to just call out a set, dribble at top of key when team ran some guys off screens and then pass to a player that went to work.  Lot to wiggle room as to what you consider an assist and Rondo was very ball dominant without driving and kicking as much as other PGs.</p>

<p>Post-ACL tear Rondo was pretty much no longer any good at offense cause he completely stopped putting pressure on the rim and just dribbled up top all game, I still remember that season he killed Dallas’s league best offense.</p>

The elevation is a real home court advantage. When Stockton set the assist record in 1990 the Jazz were 36-5 at home and 19-22 on the road. Yeah Stockton averaged ~10% more assists at home but the Jazz also scored about that many more points at home. Home cooked stat keeping can’t just give teams more points.</p>

<p>He also had less than 100 more steals at home than on the road over his career. He leads in all time steals by well over 500. The only stat of his that’s suspiciously better at home were blocks where he had 203 at home vs 110 on the road. That I’ll give you is definitely home cooking. But you could use his road average for his home games and he’s still way ahead of everyone in steals and assists.</p>

<p>Edit: just to contextualize how insane the 88 Jordan numbers are, Stockton recorded 87 more steals at home than on the road over his career. Jordan had 71 more steals at home vs on the road <em>in 1988 alone</em>.</p>

      <label for="l9neapg" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d imagine that Stockton&rsquo;s assist numbers are probably padded a little bit, most star players got that treatment, but the reason he owns the assist record is not because of smudged record keeping, it&rsquo;s because he played like 16 years in a near perfect system where he got to feed Karl Malone all day.</p>

<p>Nobody is bold enough to flat out make an assist up, atleast probably not often.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Rucker landed the Vancouver job in 1995, he says he traveled to Detroit for a training session attended by other NBA professional scorekeepers who had held their positions for a number of years. Rucker, however, was just 19 years old while working for the expansion Vancouver franchise, the new kid on the block. He was eager to prove he could score a game as accurately as anyone in the room.</p>

<p>But then they reviewed a video clip of John Stockton getting an assist on a Karl Malone bucket, and things got weird. ”There was no causal connection between the pass and the basket,” Rucker told me on PTFO. “And the majority opinion by a mile was, ‘Oh no, that’s definitely an assist.’”</p>

<p>According to Rucker, the scorekeepers told him in no uncertain terms that it was an assist because it was John Stockton. Rucker soon realized what was expected. In Rucker’s view, it was inferred that part of the scorekeeper’s job was to give hometown stars the star treatment.</p>

      <label for="l9mrggu" class="commentText"><p>the nba doesn&rsquo;t have to do that. The media &amp; fans will do it for them.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dkdjki/a_closer_look_at_michael_jordans_1988_dpoy_award/" target="_blank"> The article was posted yesterday on reddit and it was heavily downvoted</a>. And in the media, nick is the only person who has talked about it.</p>

<p>The reality is, most of current media came up around that time so this is going to be excused as just something &ldquo;that was of its time&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Even in the article,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bob Ryan isn’t shocked by the possibility that Jordan might have benefited from homer-biased statistics. Ryan, the longtime writer for the Boston Globe who was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame for his basketball coverage dating back to the 1960s, says questionable statkeeping was an unfortunate stain on the game.</p>

<p>He remembers similar controversies surrounding Wilt Chamberlain’s and Bill Russell’s rebounding numbers in the 1960s. Their respective teams traded accusations that the opposing scorekeeper padded the stats to help their giant. Looking back, the numbers are indeed startling. Between them, Russell and Chamberlain registered 26 games with 40-plus rebounds. None of the 26 games were tabulated on the road, per Stathead.com tracking.</p>

<p>As hard as it is to fathom now with fiery &ldquo;First Take&rdquo; debates and social-media wars of modern-day media, Ryan emphasized how insignificant the league-wide awards were back then — especially a second-tier award like Defensive Player of the Year. Voters back then almost certainly didn’t fill out ballots with the same rigor as modern-day voters when a single vote can amount to tens of millions of dollars in a player’s supermax extension because a player won Defensive Player of the Year.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that big a deal,” Ryan says now in an interview with Yahoo Sports. “Nobody focused much on it. This is pre-internet takeover. It’s pre-talk-show dominance. I may be wrong, but for me, I don’t remember anybody fretting about it ever. Ever.”</p>

Back then stocks were a lot more valued, and there&rsquo;s no way he got that DPOY with his away numbers, and even assuming the home numbers are better, they definitely are way overblown.</p>

<p>Btw this isn’t just based off some home/away averages. There’s clips of clearly fraudulent steals being awarded. Sometimes <strong>dead ball turnovers</strong> were awarded to Jordan as steals. Go look at some of his home games with a bunch of steals, like his 10 steal game</p>

      <label for="l9ne8h7" class="commentText"><p>He averaged 4 steals and 2 blocks at home that year. The most steals he averaged away was 2.5 and blocks was 1.5. This was a notable increase, especially for steals. In fact, Jordan averaged 3+ steals at home for 5 different seasons. Again, his highest away season was 2.5, which indicates pretty consistent inflation at home.</p>

<p>He had 0.5 or ~25% more steals at home over the course of his career. Not sure how that compares to other players, though certainly seems significant.</p>

<p>/r/nba when MJ gets his stats padded for a DPOY: well ackshually who cares</p>

<p>edit: this section from the article is funny as fuck the league had to step in to stop Jordan getting signals from the Bulls stats guy because Jordan wanted to stat pad so badly</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rosenberg and Jordan dynamic was written about in the press, and reportedly at one point drew scrutiny from the league office. According to a 1989 report from the San Francisco Examiner, <strong>Rosenberg would flash hand signals to inform Jordan how close he was to a triple-double. The league reportedly stepped in and told Rosenberg to cut it out.</strong></p>

<p>Rosenberg admitted to signaling to help Jordan chase stats during Chicago’s 1988 All-Star Game, a game in which Jordan scored a game-high 40 points, just shy of matching Chamberlain’s then-record of 42. As the site’s official scorekeeper, Rosenberg worked the game and remembered a postgame exchange he had with Jordan. In 2013, Rosenberg shared the following anecdote with the Chicago Tribune:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me I was two points short of Chamberlain?” Rosenberg recalled Jordan asking him.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘Look, every time you went by, I kept putting up two fingers. You didn’t understand that?’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>edit: I said this in reaction to how hard this got downvoted and buried when it was posted yesterday, it isn&rsquo;t entirely accurate now that this has hit the top of /r/nba and it seems like the majority on here are taking it seriously.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re downvoted, acknowledging the haters is what they want from you. If you don&rsquo;t engage with them and just downvote them, they&rsquo;ll seethe.</p>

<p>And blatantly generalizing the sub using these bottom feeders is also exactly what they want from you.</p>

      <label for="l9n4a3v" class="commentText"><p>Jordan was a generational stat padder, a fact everyone likes to downvote. But stat padding while still being one of the winningest players of all time — who cares?</p>

<p>LBJ has explicitly admitted to similar padding, and I’ve also seen him stay in and get a bunch of end of game gimmes in playoff games that were clearly out of reach. KD efficiency padder, who doesn’t take end of quarter heaves — a shot with mathematical positive expected value 100% of the time.</p>

<p>Contrast that with Steph, who sat out tons of 4q, and takes every heave. Kobe who shoots until he’s 8-30 and leaves the game with 62 pts in 3Q. Bird who left like one or two stats shy of a QD.</p>

<p>Doesn’t really matter as long as you’re winning because no one will remember anything but aggregate stats records and wins / chips at the end of the day.</p>

The only stat that most people might know is his ppg average and that&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s the best all time and a nice round number (30). Unless it turns out Steve Kerr and John Paxson were actually getting buckets and they just gave MJ all their points I&rsquo;m pretty sure his legacy will be fine.</p>

      <label for="l9nfa0r" class="commentText"><p>This sub hates on Nick and Brou, but I think behind Inside the NBA, First Things First is the next best sports talk show on TV. It’s the right blend of nuanced and bad faith takes, self awareness (their behind the scenes content on YT is gold), and lack of toxicity that I appreciate compared to the likes of First Take or Undisputed or McAfee. I watch it feeling entertained rather that dumbfounded by the likes of Stephen A or Skip, who very much feel like the old era of morning sports talk tv that’s not aged as well, imo.</p>

      <label for="l9mx29z" class="commentText"><p>The only thing I’m hoping this story achieves is to finally bury the narrative that Jordan was only interested in winning - and that personal accolades or stats weren’t important to him.*</p>

<p>*I’m well aware that this story is primarily about scorekeepers inflating his stats. But the original article also makes it clear that Jordan was chasing the steal record and the DPOY award (also see The Jordan Rules and how Jordan would also check that scorekeepers would credit him with assists during his run as PG in 1989).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always weird to me how rarely big-time sports have revewed and double-checked stats, even in playoffs/finals. E.g. Tim Duncan got robbed of at least one block in the 2003 Finals in a game he was 2 blocks short of a quadruple-double, and in the famous 2005 Texas/USC game, Vince Young&rsquo;s winning TD is in the box as an 8-yard run, even though the ball was exactly on the 9-yard hash to start the play. Also, on the previous drive on 3rd down, LenDale White lost the ball and had a teammate recover it, but this fumble and recovery aren&rsquo;t in the official stats at all.</p>

<p>They may review things better now, but it&rsquo;s still not consistent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vzw3n27K1o" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vzw3n27K1o</a> This was considered an assist by Marcus Smart, for example.</p>

<p>When there is real money riding on player props, there is a financial incentive to get it right.  While sports betting has always existed, the league is now actively partnering with sports books like DK, so there is now a very obvious financial incentive to record stats.</p>

<p>Of course, everything being recorded and available from multiple angles also helps tremendously.</p>
