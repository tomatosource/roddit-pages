</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Hiring Ham’s replacement took almost two months, and sources close to the Lakers say Redick was the choice for the vast majority of that time, outside of that wild weekend in which the Lakers made that infamous and polarizing offer to Dan Hurley.</p>

<p>“Hurley leaked the kind of offer it would’ve taken to hire him,” an Eastern Conference executive told me. “They knew what it was going to take and still came in well below that line. If you do that, are we sure they ever really wanted to hire him? So was JJ just always the guy?</p>

<p>Many around the league have been scratching their heads on everything the Lakers did or weren’t able to do this summer.</p>

<p>A major factor this offseason compared to previous ones was the involvement at the top of the organization. Sources say Linda Rambis was more vocal in Redick’s hiring than with previous coaches. Kurt Rambis was heavily involved in putting together Redick’s coaching staff — a process that took up until the end of Summer League.</p>

<p>In an effort to keep closer tabs on information running through the front office, sources say every decision involved Pelinka, the Rambises, Jeanie Buss and Tim Harris throughout the process, which led to far more conversation about each move and wound up gumming things up to the point of complete ineffectiveness.</p>

<p>“Rob is a smart dude,” said a Western Conference scout in the halls of the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas. “You aren’t going to get fired for decisions you don’t make. If you involve your bosses in those decisions, you’re that much safer.”</p>

<p>Another major factor in the Lakers’ stagnant summer: a league that feels it can take advantage of what it considers an inept and desperate organization.</p>

<p>For years, fans have decried a “Lakers tax” that raises asking prices in trade negotiations. While it’s certainly true teams don’t like helping the Lakers if they can avoid it, league sources say the focus is more on getting the Lakers to pay up with the understanding eventually Pelinka will have to save his job with some kind of move.</p>

<p>All summer, Pelinka’s primary trade targets were:</p>

<p>Jerami Grant, Portland Trail Blazers</p>

<p>Kyle Kuzma, Washington Wizards</p>

<p>Bruce Brown, Toronto Raptors</p>

<p>Cameron Johnson and Dorian Finney-Smith, Brooklyn Nets</p>

<p>Wendell Carter Jr., Orlando Magic</p>

<p>In each case, sources close to the Lakers and around the league feel the executives on the other side of negotiations inflated the asking price in the hopes of taking advantage of a front office that needs to do something.</p>

<p>“Joe Cronin asking for two first-rounders for Jerami Grant is hilarious,” said the same scout. “Portland traded one first for him and then gave him that terrible contract. Why would he be more valuable now than he was when they landed him two years ago? But it’s what you can do when you feel like the other team is desperate.”</p>

<p>Finally, the last factor that’s affected each set of negotiations the Lakers have had is D’Angelo Russell’s reputation around the league.</p>

<p>Portland has no interest in Russell, according to sources close to that situation. League sources also say Washington is wary of pairing Russell with fellow space cadet Jordan Poole. Toronto and Brooklyn are more open to acquiring the nine-year veteran, but more for his expiring contract than for what he’d do on the court.</p>
