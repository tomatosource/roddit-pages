      <p>I’m a two-decade veteran of Sports Business Journal, and I cover the intersection of sports and business for <a href="https://puck.news/author/john-ourand/" target="_blank">Puck</a>—from the leagues and the agencies to the media deals, marketing apparatus, and titanic egos fueling it all.</p>

<p>I’m here to answer all your questions about the NBA’s new media rights deals. Topics I’m keen to delve into include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where will fans be able to watch games starting in the fall of 2025?</li>
<li>What’s the strategy behind why ESPN, NBC and Amazon cut these deals?</li>
<li>What happens next with Warner Bros. Discovery, and why was it left on the outside looking in?</li>
<li>What does this type of deal mean for the future of media, from traditional TV networks to streaming companies?</li>
<li>What will the NBA do with their local rights? (Especially as regional sports networks are struggling so much.)</li>
</ul>

      <label for="lexeeie" class="commentText"><p>Hey John, I really enjoyed your podcast with Marchand.</p>

<p>I feel like Disney got a good bargain in comparison with <span class="math inline">\(2.62 billion and NBA finals exclusivity. Did the NBA know that Comcast was gonna swoop over the top and make a wild \)</span>2.45 billion bid for a package without the finals? I feel like the NBA could have put the screws on Disney and made them split the NBA finals with Comcast.</p>

<p>Did the NBA ever seriously consider carving out a 4th package, or was that never going to happen?</p>

<p>Some questions that I suspect haven&rsquo;t been worked out yet, but I&rsquo;ll ask anyway -</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I assume that NBC Sunday night games will have the best matchups. Will the ABC Saturday/Sunday games remain the same way, or will they be relatively diminished in stature?</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of which, which TV windows have exclusivity or near-exclusivity? (i.e. like the current TNT Thursday night games).</p></li>

<li><p>I think each team currently has a limit of roughly 26 games they could appear on ABC, ESPN, TNT entering the season - 6/10/10. Does that go up in this TV deal?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for answering!</p>

      <label for="lex6hx8" class="commentText"><p>I’m especially interested in the last topic - the fate of the local networks and Bally Sports. To me it’s the elephant in the room of the new media rights deal, not just in the NBA, but college sports, NHL, and MLB especially. Would love to read your view on the long term future of it, as to me Bally Sports as a standalone product is destined for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>To put it simply; what is the eventual destiny of Hornets-Pistons on a Tuesday night? Where will it be broadcast, to whom, and for how much?</p>

<p>What are the contingency plans for this? Is there a path for one of the 3 larger partners to subsume these local games in something like “Amazon Prime League Pass”?</p>

<p>do you anticipate higher resolution NBA broadcasts (ie higher than 720p) to be introduced at some point over the course of these new deals?</p>

<p>Why do you think the Amazon deal comes in at a much lower annual fee than the other two deals, especially  compared to the NBC deal?</p>

<p>It makes sense that Disney got a better deal than NBC (similar price to NBC but with Finals every year, Conference Final ever year, etc.) given Disney had an exclusive negotiating window. But I&rsquo;ve been unable to find a reason why Amazon&rsquo;s deal is a lot cheaper (1.8 vs 2.5 billion annually) than NBC&rsquo;s when Amazon seems to have a pretty great regular season package (In-Season Tournament, Thursday and Friday games, etc.) and a pretty similar playoff package to NBC. The 1.8 is even lower than the reported amount the NBA asked for from WBD during the exclusive window.</p>

      <label for="leyj2or" class="commentText"><p>In the US, to watch all 82 of a team&rsquo;s games (or 83, should they make the IST Final), you need a linear cable/satellite subscription or similar streaming equivalent (including local ABC), and access to regional broadcasts, either through the local channel the games air on or via League Pass (pending any blackouts)</p>

<p>Once the new TV deal kicks in, you&rsquo;ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>access to ESPN (via cable or a future standalone streaming offering)</li>
<li>access to Peacock</li>
<li>access to Amazon Prime Video</li>
<li>access to regional broadcasts</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the new deal, what (if anything much) can the NBA and/or their broadcast partners do to provide the same &ldquo;one-stop&rdquo; offering fans can access now to purchase?</p>

      <label for="ley23uk" class="commentText"><p>Considering these deals have international components to varying degrees (as a Brit I&rsquo;m actually surprised Sky are picking up games again), it now seems even more interesting that Apple weren&rsquo;t in the mix, especially given that NBA feels like the last real property available for the foreseeable future (happy to be corrected there but seems like a lot of consequential sports rights, especially in the US &amp; Europe, are pretty much locked up through the end of the decade).</p>

<p>Is there any real indication that they ever kicked the tires in regards to the NBA? Or do you think their sports ambitions are going to be limited to smaller properties where they can pick up an entire inventory globally, much like the MLS (or the Club World Cup deal which fell through)?</p>

<li><p>I’m curious what the happens now for WBD and TNT Sports. I’ve seen other sports broadcasting nerds advocating that WBD should go after more minor sports rights (the FIFA World Cup, Formula One) to build out a “long tail”, in addition to their MLB and NHL rights. Do you think this will be a viable strategy for WBD across the next decade?</p></li>

<p>First, love your twice-weekly private e-mail from puck dot news.</p>

<p>What can commercial venues expect with regards to availability of NBA content on Amazon?</p>

<p>Currently, NFL Thursday Night Football on Amazon Prime is made available to most commercial cable and satellite providers on a special business-only channel.  Will that process continue with the NBA?</p>

<p>Will NBA content on Peacock for commercial accounts remain behind the extremely expensive EverPass paywall, preventing nearly every small and medium-sized business from being able to enter the space to show content to their customers?</p>

      <label for="lexh6vi" class="commentText"><p>Hey John, I’ve been a big fan and I have a bit of a nerdy question for you. I’ve been following the Diamond Sports stuff pretty closely. I thought the first lien letters mentioning that they wanted to renegotiate was pretty interesting. Does that mean that Diamond is going to be cutting more teams? Or profits don’t look as good? Thanks in advance!</p>

      <label for="lexuya0" class="commentText"><p>I feel like alot of coverage of the WBD loss here has mainly centered on both zaslav&rsquo;s continuing status as a villain and disliked studio CEO in Hollywood, as well as the charles barkely angle of TNT having the strongest and most well known sports broadcast currently on the air. But were there other personal factors that drove the NBA away here?</p>

How will the NBA determine which network gets which conference final in the new deal now that NBC and Amazon are alternating one of the slots while ESPN (mostly) has the other?</p>

<p>As for the NBA deal, I believe I read somewhere (can’t remember where) that WBD and the NBA were only a couple hundred million apart before their exclusive negotiation window expired. I know money is tight at WBD right now but considering the massive ramifications losing the NBA does to the company do you think WBD could have afforded that price and kept the rights?</p>

<p>Finally what happens to NBAtv. WBD was running the network for them and now it looks like its future is in doubt</p>
