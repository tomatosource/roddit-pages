      <p>I’m a two-decade veteran of Sports Business Journal, and I cover the intersection of sports and business for <a href="https://puck.news/author/john-ourand/" target="_blank">Puck</a>—from the leagues and the agencies to the media deals, marketing apparatus, and titanic egos fueling it all.</p>

<p>I’m here to answer all your questions about the NBA’s new media rights deals. Topics I’m keen to delve into include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where will fans will be able to watch games starting in the fall of 2025?</li>
<li>What’s the strategy behind why ESPN, NBC and Amazon cut these deals?</li>
<li>What happens next with Warner Bros. Discovery, and why was it left on the outside looking in?</li>
<li>What does this type of deal mean for the future of media, from traditional TV networks to streaming companies?</li>
<li>What will the NBA do with their local rights? (Especially as regional sports networks are struggling so much.)</li>
</ul>

      <label for="lexeeie" class="commentText"><p>Hey John, I really enjoyed your podcast with Marchand.</p>

<p>I feel like Disney got a good bargain in comparison with <span class="math inline">\(2.62 billion and NBA finals exclusivity. Did the NBA know that Comcast was gonna swoop over the top and make a wild \)</span>2.45 billion bid for a package without the finals? I feel like the NBA could have put the screws on Disney and made them split the NBA finals with Comcast.</p>

<p>Did the NBA ever seriously consider carving out a 4th package, or was that never going to happen?</p>

<p>Some questions that I suspect haven&rsquo;t been worked out yet, but I&rsquo;ll ask anyway -</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I assume that NBC Sunday night games will have the best matchups. Will the ABC Saturday/Sunday games remain the same way, or will they be relatively diminished in stature?</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of which, which TV windows have exclusivity or near-exclusivity? (i.e. like the current TNT Thursday night games).</p></li>

<li><p>I think each team currently has a limit of roughly 26 games they could appear on ABC, ESPN, TNT entering the season - 6/10/10. Does that go up in this TV deal?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for answering!</p>

      <label for="lex6hx8" class="commentText"><p>I’m especially interested in the last topic - the fate of the local networks and Bally Sports. To me it’s the elephant in the room of the new media rights deal, not just in the NBA, but college sports, NHL, and MLB especially. Would love to read your view on the long term future of it, as to me Bally Sports as a standalone product is destined for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>To put it simply; what is the eventual destiny of Hornets-Pistons on a Tuesday night? Where will it be broadcast, to whom, and for how much?</p>

<p>What are the contingency plans for this? Is there a path for one of the 3 larger partners to subsume these local games in something like “Amazon Prime League Pass”?</p>

<p>do you anticipate higher resolution NBA broadcasts (ie higher than 720p) to be introduced at some point over the course of these new deals?</p>

      <label for="lexmf9x" class="commentText"><p>I have two things to ask:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How much did Zaslav’s “we don’t need the NBA” comments hurt the relationship between WBD and the NBA? If those comments were Silver’s first impression of the new WBD management, I imagine it wasn’t a good one.</p></li>

<li><p>I’m curious what the happens now for WBD and TNT Sports. I’ve seen other sports broadcasting nerds advocating that WBD should go after more minor sports rights (the FIFA World Cup, Formula One) to build out a “long tail”, in addition to their MLB and NHL rights. Do you think this will be a viable strategy for WBD across the next decade?</p></li>
