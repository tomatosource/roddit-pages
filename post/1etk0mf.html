      <label for="lidoc7n" class="commentText"><p>He should have warned him about attending Diddy parties more, if anything because the potential for that association could bite him in the ass more than the USADA investigations.</p>

<p>Lebron being a graceless douche showing off dancing during blow outs and crowning himself to grow his brand is what started pissing people off.</p>

<p>Him ramming people and traveling all over the place while being praised for his high basketball IQ when he had some of the highest turnovers per game early in his career was also exasperating but not as much as him acting as a douche in Miami with counting rings that they have not even earned or mocking Dirk&rsquo;s illness in the finals while he choked in the big moments.</p>

<p>If he had actually tightened up his ball handling and not rely on stiff arming smaller defenders, he would probably be looked at more fondly by people (me included) but he did not. Watching him elbow Danny Green to the chest as he loses the ball in the finals and then demanding a foul to be called annoyed me so that him elbowing Siakam&rsquo;s jaw on the fast break was unsurprising.</p>

<p>He has a terrible history of being super dirty and physical if he is the one doing it but would complain to no end about the slightest contact.</p>

      <label for="liecbra" class="commentText"><p>Funnily enough, him protecting his and the NBA&rsquo;s interests with what happened with Morey might not be as significant to a lot of his former fans that actually pays attention to how he plays from disliking him. Although I am sure there were many people that hated him for it.</p>

<p>I, however, understood where he is coming from considering the Lakers and the Rockets were in China at that time and he was probably scared of being involved in possible repercussions which is implied when he says Morey could have timed it a week later (when the Lakers and Rockets have already returned home)</p>

<p>He was not instantly hated. 2003 to 2008 he was well liked. 2009 he was slowly acting more of a douche but he was still tolerable.</p>

<p>Him jumping to Miami in 2011 significantly had people disliking him but the douchebaggery in the finals and the aftermath with him dissing on people making fun of him choking and flexing his wealth generated more hate.</p>

<p>Then Lebron incorporated incessant flopping started that he is probably one of the main reason rules were imposed against it. And that added to the hate.</p>

<p>Then the egomaniacal lying he makes the correct play everytime? Yeah that was not going to make people aware of his career and not living vicariously off his success a fan.</p>

      <label for="lidypnk" class="commentText"><p>My guy, I was not even aware of it because I was busy with Graduate school at that time. I only learned about it about two years after the fact.</p>

<p>I already started to dislike Lebron in 2009 but that was because of his douchey dancing and puffing his chest in blow outs which was the exact opposite of who he appeared to be in 2003 to 2008. But I still liked him even with his cocky attitude.</p>

<p>I can only say I strongly dislike him in 2012 when he started flopping like a fish while throwing his shit eating smile which was infuriating. Prior to that, I preferred him to Kobe but I never understood why people keep on insisting he has a high basketball IQ when the guy was living off the fast break by cherry picking and in broken plays.</p>

<p>I used to play in NBA Live 05 to 08 and trade for Lebron because I liked the guy. He was not as obnoxiously egotistical as he is now.</p>

<p>Something happened to Lebron, maybe it was the taste of successfully getting to the finals at a very young age or he finally got tired of playing it humble. He was very likable at first that I even ignored the chosen 1 tattoo as a possible sign he would be an egomaniac.</p>

<p>Or do you suffer from lack of social graces and ask questions out of the blue in professional settings?</p>

<p>If you paid attention you would know I asked who (male or female) look like they stink. You fantasizing about me having a smell fetish is weird, man.</p>

<p>Just the amount you’ve written in this post alone is insane lol</p>

<p>His game has never been my favorite and he destroyed us too many times to count, so the mere fact I’m here defending him should tell you how much of a hater you are.</p>

<p>My guy, want to get elbowed by a guy that is taller than you and outweighs you by 40 pounds? Want to see the same guy flail with you 2 feet away with your hands to your side and get called for violating his space?</p>

<p>Want to see another person constantly praised for the most basic of stuff because they are allowed to cut corners but still be rewarded for it because they are a favorite?</p>

<p>Hate? I used to like him but I dislike him now when his cockiness and desire for admiration does not match the effort he is expected to do.</p>

<p>You coming in here and joining the current dogpile in a topic about the fans potentially turning against Lebron (which ended up true) is you crying for and defending a guy that likely doesn&rsquo;t know who you are.</p>

<p>It is as simple as this: Former fans hated Lebron because of some combination of his playing style, his obnoxious cockiness, self aggrandizement and his fake ass personality. That is not me crying or making up stories or me being a hater as if I am the only person that took notice of this.</p>

<p>Face it, not everyone is going to like you. I just happen to not like Lebron the more I am exposed to him that his glaring flaws cannot be ignored anymore. I probably will dislike other athletes and celebrities more if I paid enough attention to them but I happened to be exposed to Lebron&rsquo;s gradual heel turn and desperate self praise hence the dislike.</p>
