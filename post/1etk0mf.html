      <label for="lidoc7n" class="commentText"><p>He should have warned him about attending Diddy parties more, if anything because the potential for that association could bite him in the ass more than the USADA investigations.</p>

<p>Lebron being a graceless douche showing off dancing during blow outs and crowning himself to grow his brand is what started pissing people off.</p>

<p>Him ramming people and traveling all over the place while being praised for his high basketball IQ when he had some of the highest turnovers per game early in his career was also exasperating but not as much as him acting as a douche in Miami with counting rings that they have not even earned or mocking Dirk&rsquo;s illness in the finals while he choked in the big moments.</p>

<p>If he had actually tightened up his ball handling and not rely on stiff arming smaller defenders, he would probably be looked at more fondly by people (me included) but he did not. Watching him elbow Danny Green to the chest as he loses the ball in the finals and then demanding a foul to be called annoyed me so that him elbowing Siakam&rsquo;s jaw on the fast break was unsurprising.</p>

<p>He has a terrible history of being super dirty and physical if he is the one doing it but would complain to no end about the slightest contact.</p>

      <label for="lidr4in" class="commentText"><p>Someone that actually sees the reason  why people disliked him?</p>

<p>He was not instantly hated. 2003 to 2008 he was well liked. 2009 he was slowly acting more of a douche but he was still tolerable.</p>

<p>Him jumping to Miami in 2011 significantly had people disliking him but the douchebaggery in the finals and the aftermath with him dissing on people making fun of him choking and flexing his wealth generated more hate.</p>

<p>Then Lebron incorporated incessant flopping started that he is probably one of the main reason rules were imposed against it. And that added to the hate.</p>

<p>Then the egomaniacal lying he makes the correct play everytime? Yeah that was not going to make people aware of his career and not living vicariously off his success a fan.</p>

      <label for="lidypnk" class="commentText"><p>My guy, I was not even aware of it because I was busy with Graduate school at that time. I only learned about it about two years after the fact.</p>

<p>I already started to dislike Lebron in 2009 but that was because of his douchey dancing and puffing his chest in blow outs which was the exact opposite of who he appeared to be in 2003 to 2008. But I still liked him even with his cocky attitude.</p>

<p>I can only say I strongly dislike him in 2012 when he started flopping like a fish while throwing his shit eating smile which was infuriating. Prior to that, I preferred him to Kobe but I never understood why people keep on insisting he has a high basketball IQ when the guy was living off the fast break by cherry picking and in broken plays.</p>

<p>I used to play in NBA Live 05 to 08 and trade for Lebron because I liked the guy. He was not as obnoxiously egotistical as he is now.</p>

<p>Something happened to Lebron, maybe it was the taste of successfully getting to the finals at a very young age or he finally got tired of playing it humble. He was very likable at first that I even ignored the chosen 1 tattoo as a possible sign he would be an egomaniac.</p>
