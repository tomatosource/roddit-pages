Although I am sure there were many people that hated him for it.</p>

<p>I, however, understood where he is coming from considering the Lakers and the Rockets were in China at that time and he was probably scared of being involved in possible repercussions which is implied when he says Morey could have timed it a week later (when the Lakers and Rockets have already returned home)</p>

<p>He was not instantly hated. 2003 to 2008 he was well liked. 2009 he was slowly acting more of a douche but he was still tolerable.</p>

<p>Him jumping to Miami in 2011 significantly had people disliking him but the douchebaggery in the finals and the aftermath with him dissing on people making fun of him choking and flexing his wealth generated more hate.</p>

<p>Then Lebron incorporated incessant flopping started that he is probably one of the main reason rules were imposed against it. And that added to the hate.</p>

<p>Then the egomaniacal lying he makes the correct play everytime? Yeah that was not going to make people aware of his career and not living vicariously off his success a fan.</p>

<p>Lebron could cure cancer and solve global hunger, this man would find a reason to still hate him lmao&hellip;.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with hating LeBron, but this isn&rsquo;t hate&hellip; this is obsession.</p>

      <label for="lidypnk" class="commentText"><p>My guy, I was not even aware of it because I was busy with Graduate school at that time. I only learned about it about two years after the fact.</p>

<p>I already started to dislike Lebron in 2009 but that was because of his douchey dancing and puffing his chest in blow outs which was the exact opposite of who he appeared to be in 2003 to 2008. But I still liked him even with his cocky attitude.</p>

<p>I can only say I strongly dislike him in 2012 when he started flopping like a fish while throwing his shit eating smile which was infuriating. Prior to that, I preferred him to Kobe but I never understood why people keep on insisting he has a high basketball IQ when the guy was living off the fast break by cherry picking and in broken plays.</p>

<p>I used to play in NBA Live 05 to 08 and trade for Lebron because I liked the guy. He was not as obnoxiously egotistical as he is now.</p>

<p>Something happened to Lebron, maybe it was the taste of successfully getting to the finals at a very young age or he finally got tired of playing it humble. He was very likable at first that I even ignored the chosen 1 tattoo as a possible sign he would be an egomaniac.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not sure if you ever paid attention to how Kobe and Jordan conducted themselves towards the media, they stuck to that (possibly fake) humility in public as much as they can. Jordan and Kobe were talking trash and beating their chest. Lebron is crowning himself and flexing on phantom fouls.</p>

<p>It is not the same.</p>

<p>Way to make a strawman but this is his delusional self praise which has been reported:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/i-make-the-right-play-every-single-time-lebron-james-calls-out-the-critics-following-cam-reddish-s-game-sealing-three-against-the-suns/ar-AA1jKTtQ" target="_blank">https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/i-make-the-right-play-every-single-time-lebron-james-calls-out-the-critics-following-cam-reddish-s-game-sealing-three-against-the-suns/ar-AA1jKTtQ</a></p>

<p>No sensible person is going to claim they make the right play everytime least of all a person that has been blown out repeatedly and swept and carried the stigma of being a choker for the first half of his career.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know how you can make that connection to him saying that about <strong>every game.</strong></p>

<p>I doubt you even read the rest of the article&hellip; and chose to interpret it as him being a &ldquo;non-sensible person&rdquo;</p>

<p>You found one example of him saying that, yet I can bring up other examples of him admitting to make mistakes.. To call him an &ldquo;egomaniac&rdquo;, sounds like projection.</p>

<p>No one is laughing at you <strong>because</strong> you hate LeBron, it&rsquo;s your own reasoning of it and the space this man takes in your head rent free. It must be exhausting.</p>

<p>Skip Bayless over here lmao. I&rsquo;m not even the biggest LeBron fan, but it&rsquo;s just hilarious to me the hate LeBron gets and how much space he takes up in people&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>

<p>edit. Also appears you didn&rsquo;t even hear the full context of the AI interview. Just like they didn&rsquo;t take the full context of him saying &ldquo;we talking about practice&rdquo; and the narrative people had about his game and his &ldquo;ego&rdquo; lmao</p>

<p>Does it matter if I am a realtor, a lawyer, a medical doctor, a military official or a public official (not confirming which, if any, I am)?  Does it change the fact that Lebron was not hated as much as he is now for his first few years?</p>

      <label for="lifem4e" class="commentText"><p>LeBron James? The so-called “King” of basketball? Please. The man is the most overrated, overhyped player in the history of the game, and I’m not even sure he’s in the top 50 all-time. Let’s be real: LeBron is nothing more than a stat-padding, media-manufactured product who got lucky by riding the coattails of better players and better teams. He’s built his entire career on flashy dunks and highlight reels, fooling casual fans into thinking he’s something special.</p>

<p>You know what he’s really good at? Whining. The guy has turned complaining into an art form. Every time he doesn’t get his way, he’s flopping around on the court like a fish out of water, begging for fouls like it’s a charity auction. The refs might as well hand him a whistle because he’s been officiating his own games for years. The NBA’s golden boy, protected by the league at every turn—he couldn’t even carry a team on his own until he formed a superteam in Miami. Oh yeah, let’s talk about that! “The Decision?” What a joke. He needed two future Hall of Famers to finally win a ring, and people still call him the greatest? Please.</p>

<p>Don’t get me started on his so-called “clutch” moments. Everyone wants to talk about his game-winners, but what about all the times he disappeared in the fourth quarter? What about the times he’s been afraid to take the last shot? The man has more missed game-winners than anyone in history, but let’s just ignore that, right? And sure, he’s been to ten NBA Finals, but what’s his record? 4-6? How is that supposed to be impressive? Michael Jordan didn’t need ten tries to win six titles.</p>

<p>Then there’s his off-court persona. This guy pretends to be some kind of social justice warrior, but let’s be honest—he’s only in it for the PR. He’s out here building schools like he’s Mother Teresa, but it’s just a tax write-off and a way to keep his name in the headlines. And don’t even mention his so-called business acumen. Owning a piece of the Red Sox? Big deal. He’s just another athlete trying to play businessman, using his fame to make deals that real entrepreneurs would never get.</p>

<p>LeBron is the definition of a media creation—propped up by ESPN and his buddies in the press, who are too afraid to criticize him because they’re all in his pocket. And don’t get me started on the fans who worship him like he’s some kind of basketball god. They’re the worst. Completely delusional, acting like the guy invented the sport. Just because he’s put up big numbers doesn’t mean he’s the best. Hell, if you let me play 20 seasons and cherry-pick my teammates, I’d have a few rings, too.</p>

<p>So yeah, keep calling LeBron the GOAT if you want, but just know you’re living in a fantasy world. When the history books are written, people will see through the smoke and mirrors and realize that he was just another overrated player who got way too much credit for doing way too little.</p>

      <label for="lief9m2" class="commentText"><p>Crying? Lame?</p>

<p>My guy, want to get elbowed by a guy that is taller than you and outweighs you by 40 pounds? Want to see the same guy flail with you 2 feet away with your hands to your side and get called for violating his space?</p>

<p>Want to see another person constantly praised for the most basic of stuff because they are allowed to cut corners but still be rewarded for it because they are a favorite?</p>

<p>Hate? I used to like him but I dislike him now when his cockiness and desire for admiration does not match the effort he is expected to do.</p>

<p>You coming in here and joining the current dogpile in a topic about the fans potentially turning against Lebron (which ended up true) is you crying for and defending a guy that likely doesn&rsquo;t know who you are.</p>

<p>It is as simple as this: Former fans hated Lebron because of some combination of his playing style, his obnoxious cockiness, self aggrandizement and his fake ass personality. That is not me crying or making up stories or me being a hater as if I am the only person that took notice of this.</p>

<p>Face it, not everyone is going to like you. I just happen to not like Lebron the more I am exposed to him that his glaring flaws cannot be ignored anymore. I probably will dislike other athletes and celebrities more if I paid enough attention to them but I happened to be exposed to Lebron&rsquo;s gradual heel turn and desperate self praise hence the dislike.</p>

<p>He is human and not perfect, so obviously he’s going to have SOMETHING to do with it.</p>

<p>Everyone likes the underdog until they hit the top and then they pray on the downfall. Doesn’t surprise me those people end up with a chip on their shoulder because less than average people criticize their mistakes and try to downplay success.</p>

<p>Dude, I will give you a single example, seeing Lebron leading with his off arm to clear space and even outright pushing defenders so he can get to the rim easier is objectively bad and disliking it is not envy.</p>

<p>Another is defaulting to thinking that an opposing team is applauding you because you have a gargantuan ego that you crown yourself: <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/other/lebron-james-mistakenly-thinks-crowd-is-cheering-for-him-in-viral-olympics-moment/ar-AA1ooR1u" target="_blank">https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/other/lebron-james-mistakenly-thinks-crowd-is-cheering-for-him-in-viral-olympics-moment/ar-AA1ooR1u</a></p>

<p>Bring some objectivity to your life even with people that you like, it must be exhausting lying to yourself that the dislike is unwarranted.</p>
