<p>Like every forum back then, there were off topic and topic specific sub forums. There was one for the NBA.</p>

<p>Some dude back then made a post about Manu Ginobili. He was in the middle of his rookie year and this dude was saying he could be the MVP, the dunk contest champ, all this shit about just how amazing he is offensively.</p>

<p>His career turned out differently, but with just as great a legacy. It’s one of the few discussions I vividly remember about my time there and on the MLG forums while Halo 2 was THE video game to play when I was in high school.</p>

      <label for="lbt0t1e" class="commentText"><p>That series, to me, shows why Harden hasn&rsquo;t won a championship. The Spurs best player got injured partway through the game, but the Rockets still couldn&rsquo;t quite capitalize and the next game Harden just gives up and they lose the elimination game by 40.</p>

<p>Nobody pouts harder than James Harden.</p>

      <label for="lbuardb" class="commentText"><p>Give me a fucking break. 2016 was def a down year for him, but in a six year stretch from 2015-2020 he finished top three in mvp voting five times and was objectively the most valuable player in the league three years straight. He never averaged less than 25 in <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> playoff series in Houston. This series he had a concussion and still averaged <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.</p>

<p>He never won a chip because as soon as he hit his prime he had to play the warriors, spurs, kd warriors, kd warriors, championship lakers, then got a career altering injury when that nets team would’ve stomped the whole league.</p>

<p>He took the kd warriors to 7 in 2018, in 2019 he averaged 35 against them and clearly outplayed Steph to take them to six while his “second option” was “worst contract in the league cp3”. Then in 2020 he has an incredible playoffs, the third most efficient scorer out of anyone who made it out of the first round behind only lebron and ad, despite being doubled any time he crossed half court because he was playing with Westbrook and the lakers straight up ignored Westbrook to double harden at all times. Harden still put up an efficient 29 ppg and Westbrook shot them out of the series on like low 30s ts%.</p>

<p>So he’s taken more games off the kd warriors in a single series than lebron ever has in total, twice.</p>

<p>He doesn’t have a ring because he was largely dragging dogshit rosters into series with way better teams. Like if your best player has to score 36 ppg while the second leading scorer is at 28 (I’m not sure you guys realize what an absurd gap that is) while also being an all time great floor general just to carry them to 53 wins your supporting cast sucks.</p>

<p>Even in Brooklyn after he had a grade three hamstring tear he went out and played 53 minutes as a decoy, and it was an inch away from working, that’s how scared defenses were of prime harden.</p>

<p>Over the past 25 years harden is tenth in eFG% in clutch playoff points ( so not even counting free throws) ahead of kd and way ahead of guys like Kobe and dirk.</p>

<p>Over the past 15 years he’s fourth in clutch playoff points scored, behind only Steph, Lebron, and butler, and he’s more efficient on them than guys like Lebron, kd, and jokic.</p>

<p>His elimination game numbers are better than Kobe’s, people just move the goalposts and say well it wasn’t to beat the best team ever with a bunch of trash so it doesn’t count.</p>

<p>Harden had probably the hardest path to a ring any all time great has ever had, and he hard carried those teams more than anyone since first cavs stint lebron.</p>

<p>If he got traded to the East after okc he would have cruised to at least the conference finals every year, and probably gets a ring. The one time he had a superior roster he got a severe injury, after playing at or near the top in minutes for like 10 years.</p>

<p>The only reason he’s considered a playoff “choker” is because he absolutely dragged crappy rosters into real series with the best teams in the league.</p>

<p>Meanwhile lillard is considered clutch by this sub basically for one shot that gave him the opportunity to get absolutely spanked by the warriors. Lillard just never gets a chance to choke because outside of the first round he almost never makes it a real series.</p>

<p>If you switched prime harden and prime Steph on the warriors Steph would have no rings and harden would have multiple.</p>

<p>Any actual fact or metric has harden as an all time great playoff performer. Just admit you hate him and it’s all based on that. That’s at least more tolerable than the blatant hypocrisy</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed all the arguments against harden are specific bad games (which every player has had, Lebron was afraid to have the ball in a finals series ffs) and not anything real?</p>

      <label for="lbvk540" class="commentText"><p>You lost me with if you switched prime Steph and prime harden the warriors wouldn&rsquo;t have won a ring. The entire point of the warriors were they were built to combat teams playing the style of basketball James harden plays. Harden is an elite talent but his skill set similar to guys like Luka and LeBron require certain guys to play with him, not alot of guys in the NBA can be effective while a guy isos 90% of time and then kicks the ball out.</p>

<p>To your other point cp3 in 2017 was actually more effective than harden he sadly has the body of glass in the playoffs which killed their chances. An lastly harden is not considered clutch like Lillard just because NBA fans cling to moments and James doesn&rsquo;t really have a lot of moment plays. He&rsquo;s obviously a way better player than lillard</p>

<p>The Spurs were still favored to win the series regardless of the game 6 odds.</p>

<p>the odds also didn&rsquo;t think the Rockets were gonna win 2 games but they did. single game upsets happen all the time. Point is the Rockets were never favorites in the series.</p>

<p>Nobody expected them to get anywhere in the playoffs, then they didn&rsquo;t go anywhere in the playoffs and people decide to lose their shit. Their preseason odds were +16000 and before the playoffs started they were over +3000.</p>

<p>The Spurs were favored to win this series the entire way through, even after Kawhi went down, largely because everyone knew Harden was gassed after that regular season and first round. People have just been really loud about Harden&rsquo;s losses and all the context of his career has gotten ignored to meme</p>

      <label for="lbt1we5" class="commentText"><p>2018 was the only great season for those Rockets because it&rsquo;s the only season Harden wasn&rsquo;t slacking off on D.</p>

<p>And doing that for the full season got him the MVP and his team the best record in the league, plus they were the only team to really challenge a healthy Warriors team while KD was there.</p>

<p>Harden actually giving a crap about defense during the regular season so that he&rsquo;s actually got the well honed skills to crank up the pressure for the playoffs is a dang scary good player that would have won at least one championship if he had actually done it for more than one season.</p>

<p>The Rockets before 2018 had just as much of a chance of being a dangerous team, but Harden didn&rsquo;t have somebody like Chris Paul who was willing to hold him accountable for his crap effort on D.</p>

<p>Harden was their biggest problem in that series against the Spurs, not the roster construction.</p>

      <label for="lbt2qu0" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s not even accurate. What changed about their defense was that they no longer had Dwight or Ryan Anderson (who they benched in 2018 and let go in 2019 to duck the tax lol) playing drop and it allowed Harden to switch into the post where he was actually a positive. He was never good against guards and most of the time they had to think about Curry, so when they were able to let him guard the post instead of be on an island with Steph their team defense got a ton better.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>And yes the roster construction was a problem what the fuck lmao. Their preseason odds were +16,000. Obviously everybody thought their roster was a problem.</p>

<p>Using pre-season odds for a team in the second round is not a solid foundation for an argument.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be like using Barkley&rsquo;s predictions in the same way, because at pre-season, that&rsquo;s just a guess.</p>

      <label for="lbtjiou" class="commentText"><p>I mean it was the Spurs minus Kawhi and Tony though&hellip;. An old Lamarcus Aldridge, extremely old Manu and Pau, Danny Green, Patty Mills, one-hit-wonder Jonathan Simmons and a bunch of young guns in Dejounte, Kyle Anderson, and Davis Bertrans. The Rockets had Harden, Clint Capela, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Pat Bev, and an old Trevor Ariza and Lou Williams. Not terrible by any means. The next year they made the WCF by adding pretty much just Chris Paul and PJ Tucker and only lost because CP3 got hurt when they were up 3-2.</p>

      <label for="lbtkaxk" class="commentText"><p>The Spurs were literally favored before and after Kawhi went down. The Rockets that year had +16,000 preseason odds to win the finals, and only +3300 before the playoffs started despite their record.</p>

<p>The guys you&rsquo;re listing were all guys on the roster when those preseason odds were released. That&rsquo;s what they thought of them. It was pretty much just Harden&rsquo;s heroics that had them overachieve and everyone expected it to fan out in the playoffs because of the lack of help.</p>

<p>Also, adding CP3 and Tucker was <em>massive</em> and Capela was a lot less green that year. You can&rsquo;t just say they &ldquo;pretty much&rdquo; just added those two lol. If anything, how important it was to finally just bring in a secondary ballhandler for James was proven with the addition of CP3 and if he had one in years prior none of his bad games woulda looked so bad because he couldn&rsquo;t have been doubled all game long</p>

Even if Harden plays well and we win G6 Kawhi would absolutely return for G7 in San Antonio (would have been played the same day as G1 of the Warriors series, where Kawhi was dominating until Zaza stepped under). It&rsquo;s really not as world-ending as people try to make out. We already massively overachieved in a retooling year after losing Dwight and our &lsquo;big&rsquo; summer additions were Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon lol. Had absolutely no business being a 3 seed much less taking a 61 win stacked Spurs team to 6 games if not for Harden. Most of the league understood that even if redditors don&rsquo;t, including CP3 who saw the potential and joined us that offseason.</p>

<p>He had a 33 pt triple double in this game being doubled all game with no secondary ballhandler to share those duties with.</p>

<p>Harden got them to 12 more wins in the regular season than they were expected to win and had nothing left for the playoffs.</p>

<p>His legacy is damaged because people never add the positive context to his seasons. People reference years where the Rockets just flat out sucked and got further than they should have because of Harden, but only want to bring up the bad from those runs.</p>

<p>Dude had no legs left after having to carry as hard as he did all season to get them there. It&rsquo;s an excuse plenty of stars get, but for some reason Harden never does.</p>

<p>it would he one thing if people ever mentioned how much he carried before the losses, but his 2015 and 2017 runs are exclusively summarized by a couple of bad shooting games when those were some insane 1 man carry jobs all season long and the lack of help is why his bad games were amplified.</p>

<p>when he plays really well and wins an upset, nobody cares to mention it (see game 6 vs game 7 against LAC) or if he plays insanely well and loses (see 2018 vs the warriors) all people want to mention is that KD missed a game.</p>

Their best player in over a decade and their primary ball handler, even if he was old at that time. The context was that they lost in overtime and then got demolished the next game by 40 points with a shorthanded Spurs. Harden was then seen at the club the next night.</p>

<p>Basically the stain on his legacy is very, very well deserved even if he took a team was supposed to not do as well to the semis. Remember, the year before they had +1500 odds and just finished 8th in the WC with Harden playing every game. The next season they added Chris Paul and PJ Tucker and then immediately took the champs to the brink of elimination and basically only lost because CP3 got injured. They didn&rsquo;t get blown out by 40 by the Warriors those games, did they?</p>

The Rockets were never at any point favorites to win that series because anyone with a brain knew that Harden had to carry too much that season and didn&rsquo;t have enough help to make it multiple playoff rounds.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea what point you are trying to make about the following season, but the year before was a disaster for all kinds of reasons and if you&rsquo;re just going &ldquo;harden bad hah&rdquo; I have no idea what to tell you.</p>

      <label for="lbu1kmy" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you&rsquo;re getting at because the Spurs were not favored to win that game, they were <a href="https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/san-antonio-spurs-houston-rockets-betting-may-11-2017-790094" target="_blank">7 point underdogs</a>. Remember, Houston was at home and the Spurs were without 2 players, 1 being their best player. They might&rsquo;ve been without both too for Game 7, at least Tony Parker.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like the previous series went 7 games either, Houston handled OKC easily in 5 - their only loss was by 2 points. Regardless of &lsquo;anyone with a brain&rsquo; knowing that Harden had to &lsquo;carry too much,&rsquo; losing a Game 6 at home by 40 when you were favored by 7 is pretty bad no matter how you try and sugarcoat it.  Hence why people view it as a stain, not sure why are trying to rewrite history so badly. No one is saying Harden is bad, in fact, he&rsquo;s genuinely viewed as a HoF player with some bad luck and some pretty bad clutch moments like a lot of other stars.</p>

      <label for="lbtljv3" class="commentText"><p>That doesn&rsquo;t pain me as much because we only had the lead to begin with because of Manu. He had the 3rd highest game score after Tim and Dirk. But boy, we would&rsquo;ve beat the Heat for sure that Finals. I wonder if that would&rsquo;ve made us less hungry to 3-peat in 2007 and maybe lost to Phoenix.</p>

      <label for="lbtxn20" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it’s really just in Manu’s blood. Objectively speaking, trying to block Dirk up 3 points at the end of the game doesn’t make any sense. But he just plays on competitive instinct. I’ll take the 4 championships with him any day though 🤌🏻 I miss watching Manu play</p>

Just an absolute joy to watch. Between this and Kawhi’s game-winner to block on Harden,  some of my fav memories as a Spurs fan are from that era</p>

<p>This Rockets team sucked. Team didn&rsquo;t have any expectations after the dogshit off-season and year they had. Harden dragged them to wins but they were set at  <strong>+16,000</strong> to win the title. Not 1600. 16,000.</p>

<p>Find me one other team with those preseason odds that anyone cares about losing in the playoffs lol</p>

This guy team up with Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon to challenge 67 win spurs. This particular game Harden had 33 points, same as Kawhi and Manu combined. The soft fans don’t bother to fact check and mock at him for losing by 3 points.</p>

As for fact checking, the rockets won 55 games and the Spurs won 61. 67 was the year before. People also ridicule him for game 6 where again, they lost by 30+ without kawhi even playing when harden was at home.</p>

<p>And if you watched the game 6, effort would be hard to see</p>

      <label for="lbs6ezv" class="commentText"><p>You think wrong. Who would pick Harden, Gordon, and Ryan Anderson over the 61 Spurs? Nobody even picked them to beat MVP led Thunder in the first round. They were not even projected to be in the playoffs before the season started. Yes game 6 is atrocious, but can you say they under delivered in that season overall? How confident are you that Curry can team up with Gordon and Ryan Anderson to beat the Spurs that season? First 5 games Harden averaged 27+11. No Harden, no game 6.</p>
