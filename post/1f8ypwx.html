</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The NBA move to Amazon has been derided as a kind of disloyal business move in the pursuit of money. Which, sure—all the businesses (TNT included) are in it to make money. But I’m curious what made Amazon more financially attractive than TNT? It’s a company with insane resources, yes, but TNT matched their <span class="math inline">\(1.8 billion offer and brought in tons of NBA viewers with Chuck and the Inside the NBA guys. I can’t think of another NBA crew that brought in viewers to watch a game in large part because of the broadcast team. If the money is the same and the viewership is likely higher under TNT, what am I missing here? Are there some unrealized financial boons from Amazon that aren’t captured in that \)</span>1.8 billion figure?</p>

<li>Longterm play that Amazon&rsquo;s streaming tech, ubiquity and audience reach will far exceed WBD/Max.</li>
<li>With Amazon getting in the NFL business w/ Thursday Night Football, they are training sports fans (much like Peacock has recently done) that Amazon Prime Video is a place for sports. You can&rsquo;t say the same thing is widely understood for Max.</li>
<li>Partnership w/ Amazon = access to Amazon&rsquo;s analytics and audience research, which are surely better than anyone outside of Netflix in the streaming space. This is gold for the NBA.</li>

<p>But also 60% of your audience purchased chicken nuggets through Amazon, 32% bought a grill in the summer, 40% bought Kia accessories.</p>

<p>NBA can now go to Tysons, Traeger and Kia saying “Hey, this is our audience data. This is who, this is where. We’re selling ads at X amount per minute.”</p>

<p>But it gets taken to the next level when teams/locality gets taken into account. 70% of Knicks viewers buy Tysons nuggets, while 60% of Lakers fans buy Perdue. The NBA can go to both companies, and sell each of them as space specific to the team.</p>

<p>Being tied to Prime accounts/account data is huge for the NBA versus relying on Nielsen or polling data.</p>

<p>This situation is super complicated and you&rsquo;re trying to simplify it.</p>

<p>Amazon did not directly take over TNT&rsquo;s contract.  TNT&rsquo;s contract morphed into something different involving both NBC and Amazon and streaming.  TNT tried to match the Amazon part of the deal and said &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a match!&rdquo;, while the NBA said &ldquo;no that&rsquo;s not a match, you&rsquo;re just picking the parts of the deal you like piecemeal and you can&rsquo;t do that&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And now we&rsquo;re at a lawsuit that will take many years to resolve.  Both sides probably have validity in their arguments, and it will be up to the courts to decide how the financials go if they can&rsquo;t settle.</p>

<p>But either way, the ship is sailing and the games will be on Amazon.  TNT can only recover financially.</p>

      <label for="llhw5kq" class="commentText"><p>Per the NBA, the attempt by WBD to match wasn&rsquo;t a 1:1 match as required by the previous rights deal which gave WBD matching rights. The NBA wants expansion onto streaming services since the majority of households are subscribed to at least one when compared to linear television. The NBA&rsquo;s argument is that WBD had the ability to match the more expensive NBC deal which involved linear television but instead chose to try and &ldquo;match&rdquo; the cheaper Amazon deal while changing it&rsquo;s terms which effectively just makes it a counteroffer that the NBA is free to reject. Furthermore, WBD did not include the fact that Amazon is paying the rights fees upfront which is something WBD doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to do.</p>

<p>I know we all love the TNT guys but the reality is they are not singlehandedly bringing in viewers. Viewer access is much more important to the NBA and the reality is that a substantial portion of US households have access to an Amazon Prime account and they want to see that viewership expand.</p>

So if you want to supplant Soccer as the biggest sport you have to have people watch your product. So when you get Amazon prime you automatically get Prime TV. So with Amazons potential growth projections your going to be able for more people across the globe to watch your product. There is no way TNT was ever going to get as close.</p>

You can argue that I get Amazon TV if I already have a prime membership but Amazon outside US isn’t exactly that great.

<p>We have to sit through 50000 ad breaks every game. It’s no different than when we had cable. Amazon better be streaming games and I need to have access to EVERY game.</p>

<p>Beat out the illegal streams. Stream at better resolution with higher stability (please buy good cameras for every stadium you bald fuck). Collect data about the ads watched for your advertisers. You stupid old white haired suit fuckers. How stupid can you moron executives be - it’s fucking 2024. Stream34st can VANISH for half a year of Michael Porter Jr.’s contract.</p>

      <label for="lli3m8p" class="commentText"><p>Everyone acts like Inside the NBA can&rsquo;t continue, but it easily can. Amazon could simply hire tnt to produce it for their games, or NBC could. Or amazon could just buy TNT, or they could hire the inside the NBA team. There are a lot of things that can happen and people are far too closed minded in their thinking about this.</p>

<p>An no, &ldquo;Why would TNT produce a show for their competitor?&rdquo; and &ldquo;NBC/Amazon can just create their own show!&rdquo; are not good responses to what I am saying. There is more than a year for these companies to decide how to handle everything, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if inside the NBA continues. As for the answer to those statements, the answer is always they will do it because making a deal will make everyone more money than not making a deal.</p>

      <label for="lli0ejw" class="commentText"><p>First, the leagues/owners/players (NBA included) are of the ilk that every rights deal should greatly exceed the previous. (With live sports still being the most valuable marketing broadcast property) So the leagues need entities willing and able to bid up each successive rights rounds. Linear/Cable networks are seeing their profits/budgets dwindle massively as people continue to migrate to other methods of consumption. That means not as much war chest/coffer to bid. Who has that type of money? The big streamers (Amazon, Netflix, Apple (although it seems they are tempering their strategy after somewhat failures to launch/not very well received entries via MLS &amp; MLB, and Google (via YouTube.) These are the leagues best bets moving forward for getting the type of money they seek. (Also those entities tend to have MUCH more liquid cash on hand which was a big point of contention in this deal. Amazon put all the money is escrow up front, WBD (Turner) offered a letter of credit. MASSIVE difference especially when considering long term solvency.)</p>

<p>Secondly, there is massive amount of data that can be harvested via Amazon as a streaming partner. The Terms &amp; Conditions (which no one reads and most don&rsquo;t opt out of parts) will allow the NBA massive pass thru sale and target ad opportunities. With linear, you have no idea about the eyeballs on the other side. That&rsquo;s why Nielsen was created. With people watching on Amazon, can literally know what type of clothes they wear, their pets favorite toy, that they just made a wedding/baby registry etc etc.</p>

<p>Third, they don&rsquo;t really care about the product, just the money. TNT doing a &ldquo;good job&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t very high on their list. Unfortunately, the leagues don&rsquo;t necessarily care about quality of product, just quantity.</p>

<p>Last, another player in the mix makes the NEXT rights round negotiations better for the league to garner even more money.</p>

<p>It was on the list, just not as high as money. Keep in mind that TNT had an exclusive negotiating period and decided to play hardball, so the NBA took their ball and left. They would have loved to keep it on TNT but they either overplayed their hand or didn&rsquo;t have the money to meet the NBA&rsquo;s demands.</p>

      <label for="llihvgd" class="commentText"><p>Others have said a lot more, but another thing to add is that the number of US households with cable went from 80+ million in 2019 to 58 million in 2023. Meanwhile, the number of US amazon prime memberships went from 125 million in 2019 to 184 million in 2024. While comparing households vs individual prime memberships is comparing apples to oranges a bit, the fact remains that cable numbers will only go down while streaming numbers will only go up. Like it or not, streaming is the future of broadcasting.</p>
