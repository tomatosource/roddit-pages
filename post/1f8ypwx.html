      <p>The NBA move to Amazon has been derided as a kind of disloyal business move in the pursuit of money. Which, sure—all the businesses (TNT included) are in it to make money. But I’m curious what made Amazon more financially attractive than TNT? It’s a company with insane resources, yes, but TNT matched their <span class="math inline">\(1.8 billion offer and brought in tons of NBA viewers with Chuck and the Inside the NBA guys. I can’t think of another NBA crew that brought in viewers to watch a game in large part because of the broadcast team. If the money is the same and the viewership is likely higher under TNT, what am I missing here? Are there some unrealized financial boons from Amazon that aren’t captured in that \)</span>1.8 billion figure?</p>

<li>Longterm play that Amazon&rsquo;s streaming tech, ubiquity and audience reach will far exceed WBD/Max.</li>
<li>With Amazon getting in the NFL business w/ Thursday Night Football, they are training sports fans (much like Peacock has recently done) that Amazon Prime Video is a place for sports. You can&rsquo;t say the same thing is widely understood for Max.</li>
<li>Partnership w/ Amazon = access to Amazon&rsquo;s analytics and audience research, which are surely better than anyone outside of Netflix in the streaming space. This is gold for the NBA.</li>

      <label for="llhvnx9" class="commentText"><p>No pre/post game broadcast team in the world is beating the reach that a growing streaming product like Prime Video can support. That is the future, not cable. Same reason TNT started streaming their stuff on HBO Max. As a streaming service, Prime Video is on the way up interms of live content (which is the big thing streaming services now want, i.e. Netflix getting WWE).</p>

      <label for="llhw5kq" class="commentText"><p>Per the NBA, the attempt by WBD to match wasn&rsquo;t a 1:1 match as required by the previous rights deal which gave WBD matching rights. The NBA wants expansion onto streaming services since the majority of households are subscribed to at least one when compared to linear television. The NBA&rsquo;s argument is that WBD had the ability to match the more expensive NBC deal which involved linear television but instead chose to try and &ldquo;match&rdquo; the cheaper Amazon deal while changing it&rsquo;s terms which effectively just makes it a counteroffer that the NBA is free to reject. Furthermore, WBD did not include the fact that Amazon is paying the rights fees upfront which is something WBD doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to do.</p>

<p>I know we all love the TNT guys but the reality is they are not singlehandedly bringing in viewers. Viewer access is much more important to the NBA and the reality is that a substantial portion of US households have access to an Amazon Prime account and they want to see that viewership expand.</p>

<p>This situation is super complicated and you&rsquo;re trying to simplify it.</p>

<p>Amazon did not directly take over TNT&rsquo;s contract.  TNT&rsquo;s contract morphed into something different involving both NBC and Amazon and streaming.  TNT tried to match the Amazon part of the deal and said &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a match!&rdquo;, while the NBA said &ldquo;no that&rsquo;s not a match, you&rsquo;re just picking the parts of the deal you like piecemeal and you can&rsquo;t do that&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And now we&rsquo;re at a lawsuit that will take many years to resolve.  Both sides probably have validity in their arguments, and it will be up to the courts to decide how the financials go if they can&rsquo;t settle.</p>

<p>But either way, the ship is sailing and the games will be on Amazon.  TNT can only recover financially.</p>
