</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The NBA move to Amazon has been derided as a kind of disloyal business move in the pursuit of money. Which, sure—all the businesses (TNT included) are in it to make money. But I’m curious what made Amazon more financially attractive than TNT? It’s a company with insane resources, yes, but TNT matched their <span class="math inline">\(1.8 billion offer and brought in tons of NBA viewers with Chuck and the Inside the NBA guys. I can’t think of another NBA crew that brought in viewers to watch a game in large part because of the broadcast team. If the money is the same and the viewership is likely higher under TNT, what am I missing here? Are there some unrealized financial boons from Amazon that aren’t captured in that \)</span>1.8 billion figure?</p>

<li>Longterm play that Amazon&rsquo;s streaming tech, ubiquity and audience reach will far exceed WBD/Max.</li>
<li>With Amazon getting in the NFL business w/ Thursday Night Football, they are training sports fans (much like Peacock has recently done) that Amazon Prime Video is a place for sports. You can&rsquo;t say the same thing is widely understood for Max.</li>
<li>Partnership w/ Amazon = access to Amazon&rsquo;s analytics and audience research, which are surely better than anyone outside of Netflix in the streaming space. This is gold for the NBA.</li>

      <label for="lljtpkc" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;d be surprised. Some of their tech is better, some is worse. Comparatively, they&rsquo;re new to the game. (e.g. Disney purchased BAMtech back in.. 2016?) They actually just announced the sunsetting of their &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; adserver (Sizmek) today, with a sunset of EOY. A <strong>huge</strong> thing is, Amazon will have no issues scaling to an int&rsquo;l footprint and load balancing concurrent viewers across a fragmented footprint.</p>

<p>It is probably more #1 and #2 IMO. WBD has a cobbled-together history both content, tech, and leadership-wise. Many of their child companies have never been particularly tech-forward (Discovery-Scripps). I think they gambled on either:</p>

<p>1.) Resigning the NBA deal.</p>

<p>2.) Aligning with Venu Sports (Disney, FOX) as they had the AEW contract in the bag.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, TNT gets to tout a highly-viewed live sport either way. Money&rsquo;s money.</p>

I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Amazon knew the physical attributes and personalities of my whole family. Like, why show a Wingstop ad if you know the viewer is a vegan? I think that&rsquo;s the kind of thing Amazon can give that TNT can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>If I’m a car dealership with a budget, yeah sure: maybe I can get away with “Boss, Amazon says it is targeted.” </p>

<p>Outside that deep nepotism, a purchaser of ads has to have a framework.</p>

<p>See, e.g., Snapchat. The best analytics in the world doesn’t change your still going to market asking advertisers to pay a premium to target demographics advertisers don’t need to slice that finely. </p>

      <label for="llitjuq" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not an expert at this at all, but I feel like the point is that there&rsquo;s potential for the super targeted ads - regardless of if the NBA has the variety of advertisers to use it. Companies will pay for ad space with the NBA regardless. It&rsquo;s just a matter of if the NBA can better target their ads.</p>

<p>Back to the vegan example, if Amazon can tell the NBA that the person watching is a vegan, then the NBA can run an ad for a Whole Foods or something instead of an ad for Wingstop. That, of course, is dependent on the NBA having a variety of ads to make that happen. If they don&rsquo;t have a good ad for a vegan, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter and they run whatever ad they want, but if they do, then they now have the option to better target their ads in ways they didn&rsquo;t before.</p>

      <label for="lljve1k" class="commentText"><p>All media companies have ad targeting capabilities to an extent. But that&rsquo;s generally not how this works.</p>

<p>Media companies sign with certain adtech companies, who offer different types of ads, targeting, audience data, etc. For the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; offering, you can just check out the <a href="http://iab.com" target="_blank">IAB</a>.</p>

<p>Also, tightly targeted ads don&rsquo;t always correlate to high CPMs. A lot of crappy programmatic ads you see at 3am with robovoices are highly targeted. The real money &ndash; especially in live sports &ndash; is sponsorships and custom ad units.</p>

<p>The question to answer isn&rsquo;t whether vegan ads targeting vegans improve sales. The question to answer is why that spend to target vegans is better than paying for a better product that is better for vegans.</p>

      <label for="llixci1" class="commentText"><p>Like, why is the value for Amazon&rsquo;s ad analytics higher than the value for a TNT broadcast?</p>

<p>The answer seems simple to me. Money. More targeted ads mean advertisers will be willing to pay more because they know their ads are going to people who will spend money.</p>

<p>A company might be willing to spend <span class="math inline">\(1000 for an ad on TNT that gets blasted to everyone, but that same company would probably spend \)</span>1500 to have that same ad go out to people they know it would be effective against. The extra money coming in probably outweighs the money that could have come in from the typical TNT broadcast with its current audience.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m no marketing agent. That just seems like what would be the case to me.</p>

      <label for="llkjnnz" class="commentText"><p>Cause it&rsquo;s a lot cheaper to spend on ads than it is to spend on the product.</p>

<p>For instance - if you had a product that sold 10 million units and you wanted to increase sales by 10% you might spend 1 million dollars to get 1 million new units of sales. If you you instead spent that money on RnD and increased the production cost of your product by 10 cents per unit - all of a sudden you have actually spent 2.1 million dollars to increase your sales by the same amount. Spending more on your product costs you mroe the more established you are.</p>

<p>Amazon probably already does this through twitch though it&rsquo;s probably far less useful because twitch is so dominated by males and people under the age of 30 that Almsot all the ads are just gaming or food related.</p>

<p>With the right analytics they can get, as the other commenter said, “hyper specific.” This can mean knowing things like what snacks you eat and the products you use and how often/at what rate. They can know the games you play and whether or not you have pets or what kind of shampoo you use or if you use condoms and probably even your gender and your sexual orientation, etc. etc. etc. they can and want to know just about everything about you, and Amazon has a hold on far more than you might think. <a href="https://www.smbcompass.com/everything-owned-by-amazon/" target="_blank">Look at this for an idea.</a> And it isn’t the subsidiaries themselves that worry me, but the breadth of it… from the pharmacy to music selection… they have their hand in so many cookie jars. Hell, some of their products are just eyes and ears directly into people’s homes… I’m sure they never use that to gather data/information…</p>

<p>NBA can now go to Tysons, Traeger and Kia saying “Hey, this is our audience data. This is who, this is where. We’re selling ads at X amount per minute.”</p>

<p>But it gets taken to the next level when teams/locality gets taken into account. 70% of Knicks viewers buy Tysons nuggets, while 60% of Lakers fans buy Perdue. The NBA can go to both companies, and sell each of them as space specific to the team.</p>

<p>Being tied to Prime accounts/account data is huge for the NBA versus relying on Nielsen or polling data.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better viewership data on how people are watching games. On streaming, you can get more precise data on metrics like total viewership, duration of viewership, when viewers are tuning into (or out of) games, which games a certain consumer is more or less likely to watch, etc etc</p></li>

<li><p>Amazon can probably cross-reference your buying behaviors on your account and share it with the NBA to target advertising for other products like team merchandise</p></li>

<li>There was probably language in the contracts that Amazon&rsquo;s bid couldn&rsquo;t be used as a stalking horse and any replacement bid would have to be materially better for the NBA. Matching the money just isn&rsquo;t materially better. This is aside from the 1:1 match deal in the previous media rights deal. That was kind of always out the window as TNT just can&rsquo;t offer the same thing Amazon can (my opinion at least, courts will determine if it only had to be 1:1 money).</li>

<p>The advertisers that partner with the NBA surely value that. Not only can they show you a Nike commercial, but also they can sell you Nike products.</p>

<p>TNT and cable providers can’t sell you the products advertised on their content</p>

<p>This situation is super complicated and you&rsquo;re trying to simplify it.</p>

<p>Amazon did not directly take over TNT&rsquo;s contract.  TNT&rsquo;s contract morphed into something different involving both NBC and Amazon and streaming.  TNT tried to match the Amazon part of the deal and said &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a match!&rdquo;, while the NBA said &ldquo;no that&rsquo;s not a match, you&rsquo;re just picking the parts of the deal you like piecemeal and you can&rsquo;t do that&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And now we&rsquo;re at a lawsuit that will take many years to resolve.  Both sides probably have validity in their arguments, and it will be up to the courts to decide how the financials go if they can&rsquo;t settle.</p>

<p>But either way, the ship is sailing and the games will be on Amazon.  TNT can only recover financially.</p>

      <label for="llhw5kq" class="commentText"><p>Per the NBA, the attempt by WBD to match wasn&rsquo;t a 1:1 match as required by the previous rights deal which gave WBD matching rights. The NBA wants expansion onto streaming services since the majority of households are subscribed to at least one when compared to linear television. The NBA&rsquo;s argument is that WBD had the ability to match the more expensive NBC deal which involved linear television but instead chose to try and &ldquo;match&rdquo; the cheaper Amazon deal while changing it&rsquo;s terms which effectively just makes it a counteroffer that the NBA is free to reject. Furthermore, WBD did not include the fact that Amazon is paying the rights fees upfront which is something WBD doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to do.</p>

<p>I know we all love the TNT guys but the reality is they are not singlehandedly bringing in viewers. Viewer access is much more important to the NBA and the reality is that a substantial portion of US households have access to an Amazon Prime account and they want to see that viewership expand.</p>

So if you want to supplant Soccer as the biggest sport you have to have people watch your product. So when you get Amazon prime you automatically get Prime TV. So with Amazons potential growth projections your going to be able for more people across the globe to watch your product. There is no way TNT was ever going to get as close.</p>

      <label for="lli3m8p" class="commentText"><p>Everyone acts like Inside the NBA can&rsquo;t continue, but it easily can. Amazon could simply hire tnt to produce it for their games, or NBC could. Or amazon could just buy TNT, or they could hire the inside the NBA team. There are a lot of things that can happen and people are far too closed minded in their thinking about this.</p>

<p>An no, &ldquo;Why would TNT produce a show for their competitor?&rdquo; and &ldquo;NBC/Amazon can just create their own show!&rdquo; are not good responses to what I am saying. There is more than a year for these companies to decide how to handle everything, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if inside the NBA continues. As for the answer to those statements, the answer is always they will do it because making a deal will make everyone more money than not making a deal.</p>

      <label for="llj2zhe" class="commentText"><p>I think it comes down to how rational everyone involved chooses to act. Being contracted to produce the Amazon broadcast is a win for TNT and is an additional revenue stream. However, if Zaslav or the TNT execs demand some exorbitant fee for that service, Amazon will just do it themselves. Same goes for NBC.</p>

<p>I know we&rsquo;re all sad that Inside the NBA is ending, but I am not expecting it to continue (at least based on what we know right now).</p>

      <label for="lli0ejw" class="commentText"><p>First, the leagues/owners/players (NBA included) are of the ilk that every rights deal should greatly exceed the previous. (With live sports still being the most valuable marketing broadcast property) So the leagues need entities willing and able to bid up each successive rights rounds. Linear/Cable networks are seeing their profits/budgets dwindle massively as people continue to migrate to other methods of consumption. That means not as much war chest/coffer to bid. Who has that type of money? The big streamers (Amazon, Netflix, Apple (although it seems they are tempering their strategy after somewhat failures to launch/not very well received entries via MLS &amp; MLB, and Google (via YouTube.) These are the leagues best bets moving forward for getting the type of money they seek. (Also those entities tend to have MUCH more liquid cash on hand which was a big point of contention in this deal. Amazon put all the money is escrow up front, WBD (Turner) offered a letter of credit. MASSIVE difference especially when considering long term solvency.)</p>

<p>Secondly, there is massive amount of data that can be harvested via Amazon as a streaming partner. The Terms &amp; Conditions (which no one reads and most don&rsquo;t opt out of parts) will allow the NBA massive pass thru sale and target ad opportunities. With linear, you have no idea about the eyeballs on the other side. That&rsquo;s why Nielsen was created. With people watching on Amazon, can literally know what type of clothes they wear, their pets favorite toy, that they just made a wedding/baby registry etc etc.</p>

<p>Third, they don&rsquo;t really care about the product, just the money. TNT doing a &ldquo;good job&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t very high on their list. Unfortunately, the leagues don&rsquo;t necessarily care about quality of product, just quantity.</p>

<p>Last, another player in the mix makes the NEXT rights round negotiations better for the league to garner even more money.</p>

<p>It was on the list, just not as high as money. Keep in mind that TNT had an exclusive negotiating period and decided to play hardball, so the NBA took their ball and left. They would have loved to keep it on TNT but they either overplayed their hand or didn&rsquo;t have the money to meet the NBA&rsquo;s demands.</p>

While comparing households vs individual prime memberships is comparing apples to oranges a bit, the fact remains that cable numbers will only go down while streaming numbers will only go up.

These apps were cool at first, but now it’s all costing way more then just one cable bill that use to carry all these channels and games. I’m not into it</p>
