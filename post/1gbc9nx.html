      <label for="ltktou7" class="commentText"><p>Still, it was wild that he torpedoed a team that was coming off of 67 and 61 win seasons and was built to win now.  The Spurs weren&rsquo;t in a position to just flip the switch into rebuild mode.  They had to endure the franchise&rsquo;s worst stretch since the 80s.  I guess you could say that it worked out in hindsight with their getting Wemby.  But that&rsquo;s more a credit to the Spurs and to luck.  Doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Kawhi fucked the Spurs over pretty hard and deserves the hate he might get from that.</p>

      <label for="ltkxut0" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re just so damn wrong on this. The Spurs diagnosed him with a chronic condition that was going to involve load management, the rest of his career. Him and his camp disagreed and thought it was a more traditional injury that Could permanently heal with rest.</p>

<p>Spurs allowed him to get a second, third , Fourth opinion&hellip; All of which came back supporting the Spurs diagnosis of it being a chronic degenerative condition. The Spurs didn&rsquo;t want him to come back and just start playing and force him To play in a situation that hurts his career, like are you freaking kidding me?</p>

<p>This is the same team that invented load management. That was fined for it. That historically sign out their superstars when they had even a tiny bump and bruise.</p>

<p>They wanted him to come back and start working on a pain and load management (sound familiar?) plan for the rest of the season and moving forward because&hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t something that was ever going to go away&hellip;</p>

<p>Eventually he found a doctor that agreed with him and his camps diagnosis and tried to parade that around That the Spurs had misdiagnosed him&hellip; San Antonio never forced him to come back and play. San Antonio never made its condition worse lmao The Spurs simply wanted their star player to stop ghosting their staff (He famously checked out of his hotel room and hid in a different room when pop went out to see him in New York City trying to meet with him and discuss what was going on) And start accepting the fact that he was never going to fully be able to play high-level basketball without some amount of care and load management the rest of his career.</p>

<p>He had a degenerative condition&hellip; He still has a degenerative condition&hellip; Him in this camp were trying to hide it because they were severely concerned it would affect his ability to get a Max contract And the years since then have done nothing but further prove, what was already fact, that Leonard and his camp lied and twisted the entire situation.</p>

<p>You trying to act like his career going exactly how the Spurs predicted (That he would have to be load managed and never fully be over his pain) As proof that they are somehow responsible is insanity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Privately, officials within organization had hoped Leonard would let the Spurs declare him out for the season due to his injury, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. Believing he’d eventually return, Leonard declined each time</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Spurs had medically cleared Leonard to return to action, but left the decision to return up to Leonard. &hellip;If Leonard returns, it will be because he has decided he can manage the discomfort of the injury, according to the sources.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In August, Leonard traveled to New York for a second opinion, an option permitted in the NBA’s collective bargaining agreement and one the Spurs supported. &hellip;“Lots of players go get second opinions,” Popovich said during the season. “Lots of players have trainers. Second opinions are good. It doesn’t indicate anything except for due diligence, making sure you’re doing everything you can to get a player back.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Spurs were cautious with Leonard, declining to play him on fewer than two days’ rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Jan. 17, the morning of the game against the Nets, the Spurs announced they were shutting down Leonard indefinitely. &hellip;“It hasn’t responded the way we wanted it to,” Popovich said of Leonard’s injury. “He’s given it a shot. He’s frustrated as hell. He wants to play badly. But if we’re going to err, we’re going to do it on the side of health.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what sucks is that there are always morons like you who will still insist the big bad Spurs were pressuring him to play.</p>

The Spurs wanted to shut him down for the season, not force him to play.</p>

<p>Kawhi refused to communicate with the team and it got to the point where the spurs were done and wanted to shut him down so the rest of the team can focus.  But Kawhi refused that.  (You have to understand that there was still a relationship to be had here, so Spurs had to just keep getting dragged along)</p>

<p>There was a famous players only meeting, this was because the players were so god damn confused with what’s up with Kawhi.  The players only meeting happened on the ONE DAY he happened to be in the city with the team.</p>

<p>In all the player interviews when they were asked about Kawhi, it was always confusion from the players.  “We don’t know.” And they just have to proceed with the unknown.</p>

      <label for="ltkv56d" class="commentText"><p>You know the Spurs knew he needed load management right? The whole issue was Kawhi wanted a max but the Spurs knew he couldn&rsquo;t play all 82 games and he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play more than 30 mpg consistently. They weren&rsquo;t going to give him the max and that&rsquo;s when everything went south. It&rsquo;s annoying that everyone still goes with this narrative that the most health conscious team, the team that was load managing way before Kawhi, was actually trying to rush our franchise player back. It&rsquo;s mind boggling</p>

      <label for="ltkytlo" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re straight up wrong on this. The Spurs diagnosed him with a degenerative condition that required him to be load managed. Yeah they thought he could play. But no they weren&rsquo;t trying to force him to play 35 minutes a game. They were trying to get him to accept the fact that he did not have a condition that Would permanently heal like him in his camp Wrongfully believed. You really think the most conscious pro-rest organization in basketball history was just trying to force a guy to play without any kind of game plan or management plan? You&rsquo;re either ridiculously naive on San Antonio&rsquo;s history and how that whole situation went down, or you&rsquo;re being disingenuous just to dunk on them.</p>

<p>They said he would have to be load managed his entire career And infamously trying to get him to come back to San Antonio so they could work on a load management plan when he decided to literally block everyone&rsquo;s number and it ghost the entire staff (including him and his camp moving Leonard around different hotel rooms when Papa flew out to New York to try to meet with him and discuss their plans for managing his playing time and injury)</p>

<p>The fact that people keep twisting this and making stuff up is insanity. Toronto literally did what the Spurs were trying to get Leonard to let them do but him in his camp Did not want it to come out that he had said degenerative condition And potentially risk not getting a Max contract</p>

<p>for the Record multiple medical professionals diagnosed him with that. That diagnosis has been held up with the clippers as well.</p>

      <label for="ltkt1tb" class="commentText"><p>The patient doesn’t necessarily know what treatment is most effective all the time. Not saying Kawhi wasn’t informed, but he has had 3 major knee injuries (counting the Quad as it’s directly connected). Microfracture surgery was common, D Rose/Staudamire notably, but teams and players went away from it when they realized it had worse outcomes after a shorter recovery.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen anything about if Kawhi did a traditional/non-traditional surgery or therapy but it absolutely could play a part in his repeat injuries</p>

To me (with the full understanding that I am an outsider and have no knowledge of my own) that kawhi would have been the one to push him away/out.</p>

<p>I could be wrong but I doubt that kawhi didn&rsquo;t make the decision to have his boy gone if he was still tight with him. Now the illegal stuff or non traditional treatments (not saying they are equal in anyway) yeah I could see kawhi trying anything to get back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hope that our client’s lawsuit will serve as a wakeup call to the Clippers organization that their players are not just dollar values, but are humans requiring proper - and not hastened - health and recovery treatment for the careers and lives afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;hastened&rdquo; treatment is kinda wild with him being load managed since he got here. can&rsquo;t imagine was &ldquo;non-hastened&rdquo; treatment would be.</p>

<p>If Kawhi and his people didn’t trust the Spurs then what do you think now.</p>

<p>I have heard rumors of the same.
Kawhi and his people aren’t listening to the professionals. Professionals aren’t always right, but they have the most knowledge and Kawhi and his people aren’t letting the clipper touch him.</p>

Damn. So he was injured in college more than once.<br>
 I couldn&rsquo;t find any info on what those injuries were, but I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if him not rehabbing in college is what started this.</p>
