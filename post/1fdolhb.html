      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fdolhb/the_best_twoway_seasons_ever_the_only_players_in/"><p>The best two-way seasons ever? The only players in NBA history to ever make All Defense while also averaging 30ppg+: Michael Jordan (7x), Kobe Bryant (3x), Jerry West (1x), Kareem Abdul Jabbar (1x), Dwyane Wade (1x)</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>These are the only times in NBA history where a player averaged 30ppg and was named to an All Defense team in the same year</p>

<p>Jerry West - 1970</p>

<p>Kareem Abdul Jabbar - 1971</p>

<p>Michael Jordan - 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant - 2003, 2006, 2007</p>

<p>Dwyane Wade - 2009</p>

<p>Surprisingly Giannis has NOT accomplished this feat. Giannis has made All Defense 5x and has averaged 30ppg twice, but never in the same season has he done both. Similarly Joel Embiid has done both three times but never in the same season.</p>

      <label for="lmho5jx" class="commentText"><p>That’s a good question. I was initially inclined to give it to Kawhi because defense is what he’s known for but LeBron during his Miami stint was monstrous on defense while being the most valuable offensive player in the world.</p>

<p>Not only that, I think Bron was a more versatile defender in that he can guard 1-4. Not true 5s though like many often suggest. However, he can guard almost ANYONE for a few possessions.</p>

It was under FIBA rules, and he&rsquo;s almost 40, while Jokić is in his prime, and arguably the best player in the world currently. He definitely could guard 5s, at least those in current NBA.</p>

MJ played only as SG and as PG as a Bull, so I don&rsquo;t consider him a wing.</p>

<p>But yeah, of course LeBron is a better two-way player than Kawhi, even Kawhi being the better defender, the offensive gap is too big when someone considers LeBron play-making ability.</p>

      <label for="lmijgmv" class="commentText"><p>Everyone who played against Wilt said he was a defensive force.  Not as good on defense as Russell doesn&rsquo;t mean Wilt wasn&rsquo;t a great defender.</p>

<p>Teams strategies included having guys try and block his path back on defense so they had a better chance of getting a shot up before he was there to wall off the rim.</p>

<p>His defense on Abdul-Jabbar is said to be the difference maker in the 72 conference finals (the two best teams in the league facing off).</p>

<p>But for the sake of argument even if we accept your premise about team strategies to block him and his defense in 72, that still doesn&rsquo;t make him the &ldquo;by far the best 2 way big&rdquo; or &ldquo;defensive goat&rdquo; that the other poster is claiming.</p>

Mostly due to awful coaching+supporting casts but still I think his actual offensive impact is sadly overrated for the majority of his career.

<p>Wade&rsquo;s numbers were insane. That&rsquo;s why the Heat announcers would call him the best player in the NBA in his prime. It was him, Bron, and Kobe at the top for a few years.</p>

<p>But Kobe getting All-Defense a lot of those years was just dumb. He could still lock in but between age, load, or both he was taking off way too much on that end to deserve several of them. That&rsquo;s not a knock against him though, it&rsquo;s just the reality of his role and physical capabilities. We&rsquo;ve been talking about the same thing with LeBron for years. The same is true for Kawhi, his defense took a step back as he got older/more wear and tear <em>and</em> became the go-to offensive engine of his teams.</p>

Just like he won his rings and they didn’t. Hardware talks and you can be salty about it all you want, doesn’t change the fact that he was the best defender at his position</p>

<p>You don’t accidentally win the most 1st team all defensive selections in history lmfao 🤣</p>

<p>And he did accidentally win the most in history. That&rsquo;s the reason people frequently point it out&hellip;</p>

<p>You can be a Kobe stan all you want, but it doesn&rsquo;t change that he was in no way deserving of several of the selections. Between guys like Rondo, Tony Allen, Raja Bell, Sefolosha, and others Kobe can&rsquo;t take off every other play and avoid guarding the other teams best player and somehow still be one of the two best defensive guards in the game.</p>

In stretches he is, but he has to save too much energy and pull it out in key moments.  He is a good team defender though.  I rank his defense as more like Shaq - could be elite but usually isn&rsquo;t due to lower effort.</p>

      <label for="lmix01v" class="commentText"><p>they switch them because thats what everyone wants to try vs jokic if they have personal anywhere near good enough.  Putting your best post defender and rebounder on him makes him even more dangerous as a passer and rebounder.</p>

<p>Everyone already cant handle him 1v1 in the first place but Embiid is a player that can put up probably the best fight in the league.  That and having the ability to free up embiid to roam as a freelance defender and rebounder are the two most common looks the sixers show.</p>

<p>PJ Tucker guarded Jokic a few years ago for half the possessions and Embiid the other half.  If Ben Simmons or Robert Covington were still on the team they would do it too.</p>

<p>Ben could have been one of the best Jokic defenders now that i think about it.  Would have been really cool to see</p>

We’ve been a top 2-12 defense (by Drtg, not perfect obv) since ~2020 (looking at the post-Ben era) despite not terribly good defensive personnel imo!</p>

<p>He looks lazy on a lot of possessions but his sheer size, strength, and defensive IQ pays massive dividends even when he’s not bending his knees and slapping the floor</p>

      <label for="lmj4na9" class="commentText"><p>Because the case should also be made based on the individual and quoting team stats doesn&rsquo;t remotely do that. DPOY really requires people actually watch the games if they want to get as accurate a picture as possible and based on watching the games, either player was deserving. Watching also highlights the play styles of the teams that directly contribute to a lot of those stats. Posting them in a vacuum is evidence of absolutely nothing.</p>

      <label for="lmhlanm" class="commentText"><p>Defense is way more narrative based because offensive stats usually paint a fairly accurate picture. Efficiency, points per game, assists etc. are all pretty easy to understand and use to determine offensive ability. Steals and blocks are the only defensive stats and they&rsquo;re way less useful to determine defensive ability. Hassan Whiteside was the best shot-blocker in the NBA but no way in hell was he the best defender. So, narrative takes over because the eye test is subjective and voters don&rsquo;t watch that much basketball.</p>

<p>The criteria of every single award is subjective in an of itself. Everyone disagrees on how much those stats matter, which matter most, which players stats are inflated in a way that isn’t representative of how good they are, how much team success matter, etc</p>

<p>When you do, Kobe deserves none of those selections. His best defensive year was 1999-2000 and it only went down from there.</p>

Offense is more than just scoring Lebron 2013 season was probably better than most of the guys you listed. I think a we should all change offense to points contributed so we can truly see how much offense is being generated which could combine scoring plus assists and often time the hockey assist(aka the steph curry assist) could be added as well.</p>

<p>And I say that as a Jordan fan that&rsquo;s got 88-91 as the best basketball ever played in history.</p>

<p>Giannis was a defensive monster who still was dominant on offense. I don&rsquo;t think it quite hits Jordan or LeBron, but it&rsquo;s absolutely evidence of two way dominance that doesn&rsquo;t reach an arbitrary cut off of 30 ppg. It highlights it even better because it&rsquo;s only 0.5 points away.</p>

      <label for="lmife2z" class="commentText"><p>Kobe getting 35.4 with 1.8 steals for 80 games is insane. That’s the best modern 2-way season imo.</p>

<p>Nobody is saying that Gianni’s didn’t have an amazing year, these guys may have had a slightly better year? Especially considering the fact he missed a good chunk of games that season compared to the others. And his defense actually fell pretty hard that season in particular.</p>

<p>Giannis defense has suffered considerably since he has taken on a bigger offensive role imo.</p>

      <label for="lmifot3" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re joking right? That&rsquo;s not even Kobe&rsquo;s best two-way season&hellip; Steals are not a barometer for defensive value or impact.</p>

<p>Lol, how are you going to respond and then block me? And no, I&rsquo;m not thinking of only his best defensive years. I&rsquo;m thinking of his two-way impact that necessarily encapsulates high end defensive impact. Something that was lacking that year for Kobe because his offensive load was so huge that he could not consistently be a defensive force.</p>

<p>Taking most ppg and most steals doesn&rsquo;t equate to greatest impact. Jesus that&rsquo;s dumb&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lmhd466" class="commentText"><p>I feel like All Defense matters alot less for guards. Like for instance MJ in his DPOY season was less defensively impactful than alot of centers that didnt make all defense just because how important rim protection is.</p>

<p>That means that answer is probably Hakeem Olajuwon in like 1994 or 1995.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lmhimld" class="commentText"><p>The reason for that is because interior defense affects a whole team while perimeter defense is more contained. For example, lets say you beat a perimeter defender off the dribble, well its not the end of the world because you have your interior defender behind them to clean it up. If your interior defender gets beat, thats generally done and thats a score.</p>

<p>Also the paint is the most efficient shot in the league, if you can make an entire team shoot 5% worse in the paint thats way more valueable mathematically than making 1 guy shoot 10% less.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that for alot of these seasons Kobe, Wade and Jordan were not guarding the opposing teams best players night in and night out unlike someone like Jrue Holiday or Gary Payton for instance. How valueable is your defense if its almost exclusively contained to 1v1 while also not being on the best oppossing player.</p>

      <label for="lmhv3fk" class="commentText"><p>These are great points and an excellent assessment, although I disagree about your last paragraph. To not include Jordan&rsquo;s and Kobe&rsquo;s perimeter defense in the success of those all-time great teams doesn&rsquo;t make much sense imo.</p>

<p>I have personal experience seeing what one on one on ball perimeter defense does for an entire team as watching the Detroit Pistons go to 5 consecutive Eastern Conference Finals and 3 straight NBA Finals after rookies John Salley and Dennis Rodman were drafted, but mostly due to Dennis Rodman perimeter defense and ability to guard every player 1-5 all by himself on the perimeter.  The Pistons had not won a playoff series during Isiah Thomas&rsquo;s career until he came to the team.</p>

<p>Scottie Pippen 6 championships.</p>

<p>Michael Cooper 5 championships</p>

<p>Pre injury Klay Thompson</p>

<p>Kawhi Leonard</p>

<p>John Stockton 2 Finals Appearances</p>

<p>Jason Kidd 3 Finals Appearances</p>

      <label for="lmicfl3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah thats a great point. They are absolutely key, specially those guys that can be thrown into whoever is the best player on the opposing team. I just feel like for MJ for example, he has a DPOY while Pippen doesnt and I feel like Pippen was a more valueable and greater defender. Obviously to win a championship you need all of them and not saying that MJ, Kobe and Wade were not impactful defensively.</p>

      <label for="lmiekfg" class="commentText"><p>Uh yeah? Stockton was an elite offensive player, one of the best of his era.</p>

<p>Are you saying someone like Melo is a better offensive player than someone like Jokic?</p>

      <label for="lmhauk5" class="commentText"><p>Why 30 ppg? If we want 2 way players it should be 50 offense 50 defense. It should be players like pippen and kawhi. The MJs and Hakeems where they won mvp and dpoy are the best seasons overall. Not making this distinction makes classifying 2 way players completely obsolete.</p>

      <label for="lmhcnyw" class="commentText"><p>As Celtics fan I am glad that people are dumb enough to measure things this way. I can assure you that Bill Russell did more things to win any of these folks. Equally dumb is Jabbar only being on this list once, another great two way player, and Gerry, the logo, West. All three were truly winning players. Keep undervaluing Tatum and Brown who have bought into team basketball, which doesn&rsquo;t lead to eye popping numbers. Keep your numbers and we&rsquo;ll keep hanging banners.</p>

<p>Both MJ and Kobe are on that list of 30+ points a game elite defenders and both have a lot more rings than the Celtics had in the last 40 years.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your point really ? What are you proving about team basketball ?</p>

      <label for="lmho80s" class="commentText"><p>Read more closely, I gave props to two great Lakers who were also not on the list. TBH I was annoyed that Tatum doesn&rsquo;t get more props, but I&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s better that way. The more people who focus on gaudy stats the fewer people who will construct teams correctly.</p>
