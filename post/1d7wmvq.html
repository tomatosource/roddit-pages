      <label for="l729m85" class="commentText"><p>I get your frustrations I do. But you have to keep in mind a few things. We made the commitment to Dirk as OUR guy. The league looked wayyy different even 10 years ago where you didn‚Äôt have a bunch of hopping around by these stars and Donnie held onto his commitment to his own downfall. Now that‚Äôs not to say he didn‚Äôt make some bone headed moves but for every one he did make, we also got burned by free agents because A, they didn‚Äôt want to come play in Dallas or with Dirk. Aka, things that were just out of Donnie‚Äôs control. You have to remember up until like 2017 the man gave us like 10+ 50 win seasons.¬† It was his time to go and Nico has been great but we mavs fans are a little spoiled with our expectations that things always need to be figured out immediately.¬†</p>

      <label for="l72rsg9" class="commentText"><p>He wanted to draft Giannis. Wasn‚Äôt his fault that Rondo quit on the team so bad that Carlisle didn‚Äôt want to coach him anymore.</p>

<p>Remember 2014 playoffs, Mavs pushed that spurs team that won to 7 games. Dejuan Blair getting himself suspended in game 5 didn‚Äôt help.</p>

<p>2015 Mavs had the best offense in the league until they traded for Rondo.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know if you think top free agents sign for the Mavs because they historically haven‚Äôt and just use the Mavs to increase their contract demands with the teams they do want to play for.</p>

<p>In short, Donnie Nelson was probably the best GM for the Mavs until we got Luka. Sad that KP got injured and didn‚Äôt workout, but they looked pretty amazing in their first playoffs together against the Clippers. KP getting suspended for standing up for Luka sucked and hearing about his injury afterwards was a double blow.</p>

During the hold out year in 2012 Donnie&rsquo;s attention went to the G-League team that he is still a partial owner in.</p>

<p>If Donnie was the best GM for them then why was Cuban the one doing all the work (i.e Howard, Jordan, Deron).</p>

      <label for="l75fvue" class="commentText"><p>I gave out several examples how he was not as bad as people think.</p>

<p>2014 Mavs pushed the Spurs to 7 games. Had a pretty good chance at beating them had DeJuan Blair not been ejected. No other teams challenged them as hard in the postseason</p>

<p>2015 Mavs had the best offense in the NBA until we traded away some players for Rajon Rondo and Dwight Powell. Rondo quit on the Mavs and Rick refuses to coach him.</p>

<p>If you can name moves he‚Äôs able to do that would have made the Mavs better, I‚Äôm open to hearing it.
Keep in mind, Mark Cuban didn‚Äôt want to draft Giannis because he wanted to preserve cap space.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs not forget that he almost signed Deandre Jordan away from the clippers. Can‚Äôt think of any free agents who would actually consider coming to Dallas other than using the Mavs to get more money from other teams.</p>

<p>Had Kyle Kuzma said yes to the trade to the Mavs, i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if everyone here would have a different opinion on Nico Harrison</p>

<p>Edit: Dwight Howard was a solid between his agent and Cuban and it didn‚Äôt get done.</p>

      <label for="l75n5ze" class="commentText"><p>2014 - We should have fully expected to push the Spurs.  Division rival that the coaching staff has several years to have a book on.  All credit there goes to Rick.   Look at the roster and tell me where Donnie succeeded?  Ricky Ledo, Sam Dalembert.  Shoot Donnie&rsquo;s drafted player on the rise was Sarge.   So in 2014 all credit should go to the coaching staff.  The roster was abysmal and that&rsquo;s on Donnie.</p>

<p>2015 -  Right we did have the best offense because Barea cam back.  Ray Ray showed up to redeem his career and Jefferson.  So sure give Donnie credit for some bargin moves.  But Rondo.  Everyone knew he was a shitbag.   That guy only wanted to play in Boston and again everyone knew it.  Boston was ready to get rid of him because they were sick of his shit.  But Donnie had the bright idea to trade for a guy who didn&rsquo;t want to listen to any coach.  Rick should have won that battle and he did.  Rondo says Rick didn&rsquo;t want to coach him.  My guess of what we all know of Rick is more than likely Rondo didn&rsquo;t want to be coached.</p>

<p>14 other teams didn&rsquo;t draft Giannis either.  We hold not drafting him as a failure.  Where does it say from anyone other than Donnie that the Mavs wanted him?  Again hindsight is 20-20 and all but just because Donnie says it doens&rsquo;t make it true.</p>

<p>Donnie didn&rsquo;t do shit to sign DeAndre.  That was all Cuban.  Same with Howard and Deron.  That was all Cuban.  The obvious team plan for those years was a big fish.  Cuban AND Donnie were on board with that.  If Donnie wasn&rsquo;t on board then he had multiple years where he could have quit.</p>

<p>Truth is that in 2012 during the lockout Donnie checked out.  At that time he wanted to run the Legends because that was the only way people were going to blow smoke up his ass.  Because like so many others Donnie was an egomaniac who continually lived off of the Dirk draft (to his credit).   Cuban should have fired him then.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the thing though.  If Donnie hadn&rsquo;t been on board with that way of building a team through top tier free agents, he had multiple years of doing something about it.   If you&rsquo;re working for someone as a GM and they are not listening to you then why the hell do you stick around all that time?  Either 1. You are on board or 2. You&rsquo;re just a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; man to save your cushy job.  My guess is Donnie chose both.</p>

      <label for="l75hjnv" class="commentText"><p>Let&rsquo;s be honest about that draft.</p>

<p>Suns - Were always going to take the hometown kid.  I don&rsquo;t believe for one second they considered anyone else.  Their fanbase would have rioted if they picked anyone but Ayton.</p>

<p>Kings - The Kings had Fox already.  They were building around him.   If they drafted Luka, Fox would have been gone within a year just like Dennis Smith Jr was.  Sactown was all in on Fox.  Vlade is a moron as well obviously but at the time Kings fans were slotting Luka in as a SG/SF because Fox was their guy at the point.</p>

<p>Hawks - Imagine the Hawks taking a white guy from Europe.  Have you seen the Hawks demographic at games.  No way they were going to take Luka.  Trae was a great pick for the team and the fanbase.  The surrounding players since then not so much but Trae is great in ATL.  They&rsquo;ll regret him being gone when he leaves.</p>

<p>We all like to jump on a bandwagon after a player hits big.  Hindsight is 20-20 right?   Two teams passed on Jordan.  Redo that draft and Jordan is winning rings in Houston.  Portland is relevant with Akeem.  The Bulls go from the team of the 90&rsquo;s to bottom dwellers because Bowie is injured.</p>

<p>You do know Brunson wasn‚Äôt looking great in his first 2 years as a Mav. Brunson also disappeared in the 2021 playoffs which made the Mavs reconsider resigning him.
He was willing to sign a smaller contract than what he got in the offseason with the Knicks at one point during the 2022 season before the trade deadline until he started playing amazing when Luka was out for a bit. Jalen scored +5.3 points in the playoffs of 2022 than he did in the regular season. He was also played off the floor defensively a few times in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt act like everyone knew Brunson would be the player he is today had he not left the Mavs for the Knicks. He needs the ball in his hand as much as Luka and doesn‚Äôt fit as complimentary as Kyrie.</p>

<p>Brunson has even said on his own podcast that the Mavs never made an offer in the offseason. That‚Äôs probably more on ownership than a GM.</p>

It&rsquo;s just moronic to do it, if Brunson was a RFA, the Knicks don&rsquo;t dump numerous salaries, trade picks and sign him. Since there is the chance of the Mavs just matching anyways.</p>

      <label for="l743k7l" class="commentText"><p>As I mentioned before, no one knew how good Jalen Brunson would be. Mavs weren‚Äôt interested in extending his contract after his 2nd year. His 3rd year, he played better but disappeared in the playoffs which lead the Mavs to not giving him a serious offer. He was rumored to be on the trading block for a bit in his 3rd or 4th year, and then he made it big in his 4th year after the trade deadline.</p>

<p>Most 2nd round picks contract are structured that way to get an extra year of cheap cost than letting them go a year early and having to match.</p>

<p>In retrospect, a lot of things are moronic. Jalen Brunson was the 33rd pick which means every team had passed him at least once. Some teams more than twice.</p>

<p>Even still it&rsquo;s GM malpractice to even give out that contract in the first place. If literally every other GM had figured out that it&rsquo;s a bad idea to structure it that way why didn&rsquo;t Donnie? He was a good GM early in his career, but he was clearly slipping by the end.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just Cuban excuse for being cheap though? Cuban Words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s my biggest mistake ever. Not even close, my biggest mistake ever. He had been injured the year before and his minutes were declining, and our doctor was like, &lsquo;He may have some issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When in reality Nash missed only 4 games in his last 3 seasons with the Mavs, without his minutes declining. Nash left, reluctantly even, because Cuban offered him only about 2/3rd the money the Suns offered, which was less than the 4th highest paid player on the Mavs too.</p>

<p>That was Cuban though, cheap to pay guaranteed talent already on his team (Dirk only became Mavs highest paid player in his 12th season), but willing to pay heavy money to guys like Antoine Walker, Keith Van Horn, and a 34 years old JKidd. 2011 made most fans think it worked out at end, maybe it did (like let Brunson walk maybe will), but most of the times, the way the front office did things, left me with a sour taste in my mouth.</p>

      <label for="l756ayc" class="commentText"><p>I would rather have Raef, with his big contract, in a wheelchair on the side of the court than Antoine Walker being the highest-paid player on the team. <sup>2003</sup>&frasl;<sub>2004</sub> was my second season following most of the Mavs games, and I still remember how much Walker sucked (I just searched his stats and can&rsquo;t believe how decent they look).</p>

<p>I understand taking on a big expiring contract to make room to re-sign your All-Star PG while trying to sign some good defenders, but no, besides letting Nash walk for free, they signed Van Horn, another mediocre player with a massive contract. The Mavs&rsquo; only good acquisition that postseason was Jason Terry. Having a winning team makes things look different though.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m being overly critical here. The Mavs built some really good rosters by being great at getting really good role-players in smaller trades. My issue is that they never got a second guy after not paying Nash while overpaying questionable players.</p>

Insane draft record, great trades, and he seems to be very levelheaded with his team building philosophy. Only a few blunders like Harden to Houston</p>

      <label for="l72ympg" class="commentText"><p>I think Presti is definitely top 3 just in the long term for what he‚Äôs done and is doing, but this year I think he kept the powder too dry in exchange for future dreams. I think a big move would‚Äôve had OKC with a shot at the conference finals with how close that Dallas series was, and with how minny struggled with Dallas anything could‚Äôve happened from there.</p>

<p>Championship windows are very small these days and also take luck to be on your side. I think OKC and presti had the assets this season to make a formidable move without significantly impacting their war chest and ability to make more moves this offseason and the future beyond. Just my 2c though.</p>
