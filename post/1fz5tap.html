      <label for="lqzev0w" class="commentText"><p>Wemby I understand because of age and upside and physical tools, and Jokic because he’s clearly the best player in the NBA who has won a ring, but I’m with you that SGA over Luka makes no sense really. Luka is younger, more accomplished, and has proven he can lead a team in the playoffs. SGA has a few years where he underperforms and he’s Embiid. There’s a lot less variance with Luka who has shown he can take his team on deep runs and beat great teams (Suns in 2022, Thunder in 2024). If SGA can prove that, sure we can give it to him, but I agree it makes little sense.</p>

<p>The only other player I’d even consider taking over Luka all things considered (age, versatility, ceiling, availability, proven playoff track record) is Tatum but even then I’m willing to concede Luka is an individually better player than Tatum at this stage that you’d take him first starting a new team.</p>

<p>Luka still has to be 3rd to me on that list</p>

      <label for="lqzmk2n" class="commentText"><p>Even being 4 years younger, Jokic at 29 isn’t really old. He’s in his prime, one of the most durable stars in the league, and super easy to build around where he’s proven he needs 0 All Star talent to win at a high level. You can basically put any guards and forwards around him (shooters, non shooters) and it will translate to winning which he’s proven the last 5 years or so. He’s been top 2 in MVP voting the last 4 years and I feel like the only argument Luka has over him is age, which I feel isn’t enough to justify it.</p>

<p>If you start a team from scratch, Luka wouldn’t feel like a bad pick, but I still feel like Jokic has to be number 1 for me, all things considered. But difference of opinion. I don’t think there’s any terribly wrong picks because it’s a hypothetical with no way to make future projections.</p>

      <label for="lr0wr8h" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it’s hard to say for sure, here’s my optimistic comparison of Jokic with LeBron:</p>

<p>2018 Bron was when he was 33. You could argue 2013 MVP Bron (age 28) was his athletic prime, but in 2018, the playoff level he displayed while playing 82 games in the regular season is arguably the best ball he played.</p>

<p>Jokic could have a similar future if he somehow keeps improving his understanding of the game like LeBron did between 2013 and 2018.</p>

      <label for="lr37zcf" class="commentText"><p>Personally I&rsquo;d take Tatum over Luka because I think Tatum has better defense and intangibles (attitude, effort, injury risk, etc), which I think are harder to recreate in the aggregate than the scoring Luka gives you. His playmaking is great sure but the playmaking gap between Tatum and Luka is narrowing and it isn&rsquo;t as big as everyone likes to pretend. Just watch the Finals. Luka is a sensational offensive superstar but until he can do better on defense I don&rsquo;t think he contributes to team winningness as much as Jayson Tatum.</p>

The Nuggets lost Bruce Brown last offseason while we got Jrue and Kristaps— this year we brought everyone back, so it&rsquo;s not really <em>that</em> surprising.

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that surprising. Knicks still have some question marks with their roster (primarily depth) and certain matchups, and Sixers (primarily Embiid and PG) have to prove they can stay healthy for the most important stretch of the year.</p>

<p>Even if you engage full skeptic mode the Celtics have the least amount of questions of any team in the East so it makes sense they&rsquo;re the overwhelming favorite to make the Finals. Of course, everything can start to look different come April.</p>

      <label for="lqz5cld" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;ll see how it plays out but imo that&rsquo;s not really that much of a concern at this time. The Sixers already ran pretty much the offense they&rsquo;re likely to run last year. You get the ball to Embiid in the post, Maxey on the strong side a pass away, and plenty of off ball movement. This was already an extremely efficient play whenever they ran it last year (1.14 PPP). It&rsquo;s just now you&rsquo;re replacing Tobias with PG so the help defense is less likely to want to stick to Embiid and Maxey, particularly when the latter drives. Then when Embiid sits you can let PG do his thing.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll obviously mix and match more than just that (like having Maxey in the corner with PG one pass away instead) but like how the offense between the three of them works is maybe the thing to least be concerned about, and Nurse is more than capable of adapting.</p>

      <label for="lqz9jlt" class="commentText"><p>Ehh, I don&rsquo;t really see the issue. Embiid and Maxey showed really solid chemistry last year and PG&rsquo;s an excellent off-ball player— it might take a little bit to gel but I don&rsquo;t really see a ton of risk there stylistically. The question&rsquo;s more about health and the supporting cast— Philly did a great job of scooping up guys off the bargain bin, but it&rsquo;s still kind of a crapshoot with those sorts of guys</p>

      <label for="lqz8yx2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I mean the biggest question is about our center situation (i.e. KP&rsquo;s health and Horford&rsquo;s age)&hellip; which would be more concering vs. the Knicks and Sixers if they didn&rsquo;t have literally the same issues with KAT, Mitch, and Embiid. Granted, KP is coming into the season injured and basically guaranteed to miss two months, but until we actually <em>see</em> Horford fall off the aging curve (it&rsquo;s coming eventually, but no real evidence of it yet), we&rsquo;ve got a more reliable backup option than either of those teams do, and probably better third-stringers too.</p>

<p>(is that controversial? i feel like Xavier Tillman and Luke Kornet are pretty comfortably better as third-stringers than <del>Paul Reed</del> or Jericho Sims, especially in tandem)</p>

<p>edit: apparently Paul Reed is a Piston now. i&rsquo;m not even sure who the Sixers&rsquo; third-string center is anymore</p>

      <label for="lr09fvh" class="commentText"><p>Damn, I didn&rsquo;t realize Reed was gone. Drummond&rsquo;s the backup center, though, and I&rsquo;m talking about the guys who are third-stringers when everyone&rsquo;s healthy— X and Kornet are behind Kristaps and Horford, Sims is behind KAT and Robinson, Drummond&rsquo;s only behind Embiid.</p>

<p>I guess your third-stringer now is&hellip; what, Adem Bona? Max Fielder? I feel like y&rsquo;all would have to try some small-ball lineups with no true 5 if it gets to that point. The third-stringers only really matter when your starter or backup is hurt, but&hellip; well, that&rsquo;s kind of something you have to account for with all three of these teams, which is why I&rsquo;m bringing up the third-string center depth in the first place</p>

      <label for="lr1r78x" class="commentText"><p>Sixers 3rd string C could be Bona, but it might be Yabusele in a small ball lineup. He’s only 6’8”, but he’s a very thicc boy, and he’s been absolutely bruising dudes in the paint in preseason (and the Olympics). Chances are that Tillman/Kornet are better than him, but I won’t be that shocked if he ends up popping a little bit.</p>

<p>I assume the Knicks are going to trade/buyout market another center at some point, what with the Robinson injury (I also think they’ll reeeeally miss Hartenstein, KAT trade and all).</p>

<p>Sims is an OK bouncy athletic lob threat type who fits in reasonably well with the Knicks insane-o offensive rebounding playstyle, but I don’t think he’s actually all that good. I kind of think the Knicks think this too, otherwise he would’ve played more when Robinson was clearly hobbled.</p>

      <label for="lqz3x97" class="commentText"><p>Celtics hunt switches onto weak guards like nobody else in the league, and Brunson will forever be an issue on defense against a team like Boston.  I&rsquo;m also basically assuming Robinson goes down by the postseason, which leaves the Knicks super exposed in the post.  Undersized PG plus no rim protection spells serious trouble.  I think their depth also took a huge hit - particularly if Robinson goes down, those 7-8 spots in the rotation are slim picking.</p>

<p>Sixers are literally just another incarnation of the same exact team they&rsquo;ve had for years.  Upgrading a flawed Harris to a better but more injured and flawed/aging George isn&rsquo;t the needle mover some seem to expect.  They&rsquo;re starting two bench guys and the actual bench is weak.</p>

      <label for="lr0o490" class="commentText"><p>The Knicks had a 127 defensive rating when Brunson was on the court in 5 games vs Boston. I mean maybe you could say it was something else BUTTTTT lol that’s a large number. But I have always felt as a Celtics fan that in years past the Knicks had a much better defense when IQ was on the court cuz he held his own in switches and was decent at hedging and recovering to his man + had an extra few inches in wingspan. And personally I think this problem get exacerbated with Towns in the fold. He has been just a disaster vs Boston in space and I’m not sure who you put him on when Porzingis is healthy.</p>

<p>Like that’s two guys that Boston is gonna make guard in space and the goal is to get NYK to commit another player to help and I frankly don’t think NYK can avoid helping in those situations. On the other end we put Jrue Holiday on KAT last year and didn’t send anyone else his way and Jrue gave him multiple problems. Mazzulla and the Celtics basically make you play 5 on 5 defensively. There’s just no way around it, you have to count on your worst defenders being able to hold their own in space, the Cs are too good at screening and shooting to get away from it. They aren’t bringing OG or Mikal into the action and the classic response would be to not switch those guys off the Jays but the Jays are just insanely good at screening guards and slipping out and Jrue/White have perfected it too. You just need as many + defenders as possible and the ability to play straight up defensively. The Mavs had some success zoning up the paint and putting their rim protector on Jrue and then the Celtics started swinging the ball from the strong side to the other corner and making that guy move. It’s honestly really an insane task to guarding Cs if you have one guy to pick on but if it’s two then GGs.</p>

<p>Big fan of the Knicks moves but just getting wings isn’t a solution to the Jays. They would have been solved years ago if that was the case. It’s always been more about how good is your smallest guy and can your biggest guy check them in space + protect the rim. It’s why we lost the Finals and Miami is still a team I have my eye on when healthy. Dray and Bam are the best Jays defenders in the league.</p>

      <label for="lqz4e3i" class="commentText"><p>The Knicks also are gonna play 5 out now on offense and were already one of the best teams in the league offensively last year after getting OG. Now they have mikal who is another above avg 3 and d player. And then kat is the best shooting big man in the league arguably with porzingis. This isn’t like the mavs where they can hunt luka on defense and then just leave mavs players open on the 3 pt line. The Knicks offense is gonna be a serious problem.</p>

<p>If any Celtics player is overlooking the Knicks I’d think they are morons. I don’t think they are tho I think they know they are gonna go to war with ny in the playoffs this year barring injury.</p>

      <label for="lr08rwd" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s assuming we&rsquo;re 100% guaranteed to be the one seed. If you were <em>really</em> high on the Sixers or Knicks, I think the argument would go &ldquo;well, Boston will have some championship hangover, plus Horford&rsquo;s getting old and KP will miss several months— they probably won&rsquo;t win 64 games again, and I think this other team is good enough that they could have a better regular-season record, at which point the Celtics are the ones who have to deal with the other one in the 2nd round&rdquo;. Again, I don&rsquo;t think I <em>agree</em> with that, but it&rsquo;s not an unreasonable argument.</p>

<p>(Also, for what it&rsquo;s worth, the Bucks might also be in that tier with the Knicks and Sixers. Hard to tell after the weird season they had last year, but they&rsquo;ve still got Giannis and Dame. If there are <em>four</em> top-tier contenders in the East rather than three, the second round stuff doesn&rsquo;t matter as much)</p>

      <label for="lr0j4pe" class="commentText"><p>To the extent that the current CBA promotes parity, it&rsquo;s via a pretty shitty mechanism of effectively making it impossible to keep a good roster together once you&rsquo;ve built it. Ideally, the CBA should level the playing field by making it <em>easier</em> for teams to hold onto talent that they&rsquo;ve developed via the draft or shrewd free agent signings, rather than making it <em>harder</em> to do so. Otherwise we just get a merry-go-round of whichever teams happened to peak in their roster building in the right way for the right 1-3 year window.</p>

<p>It happened to Denver and it will happen before long to Boston, despite both teams being built in a very smart, patient, shrewd, and fair way. Those franchises and their fanbases should be rewarded by being able to keep those teams together rather than being forced to blow them up.</p>

      <label for="lr137jl" class="commentText"><p>On the slim (maybe 20-30%) chance the Celtics do win it again this year, I truly can&rsquo;t imagine ownership blowing it up after going back to back.  That&rsquo;s just bad juju.  I think they&rsquo;d pay the 300m luxury tax to chase the threepeat.  If they don&rsquo;t repeat, solid chance one of Holiday or White get moved.</p>

If you told somebody this time last year Denver wasn&rsquo;t even going to make the WCF, you would&rsquo;ve gotten mocked and downvoted, ESPECIALLY if you said who they would lose in the second round to.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we just have to let things play out man, I would&rsquo;ve lost a lot of money on Milwaukee back on 2022 bc I just knew they were going to repeat, and now look.</p>

      <label for="lr0pkx3" class="commentText"><p>This is what I hate about basketball. There&rsquo;s too many what ifs from the slightest margins, then people run with that narrative and never give the loser a chance.</p>

<p>Denver went 7 games and <em>should&rsquo;ve</em> won G7 but Jokic playing 47 Mins screwed them over. He was more gassed than I&rsquo;ve ever seen him. MPJ was just cold the whole series too. 6 ppg for a mad player is insane. I can&rsquo;t believe the series went 7 games with Murray playing the way he did and MPJ averaging 6 ppg.</p>

<p>Wolves were our hardest match up in the west and we nearly won. I&rsquo;d favour Denver to beat Dallas in the WCF if that happens and then it&rsquo;s a 2nd consecutive finals appearance and no one bats an eye.</p>

<p>I think celtics wouldve likely destroyed Denver in the finals that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t really care how the west unfolded in the end</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not too concerned about the offense just because in the playoffs I don&rsquo;t really think anybody can shut down Spida. Man averaged 32/6/5 on 52FG% and 53 3pt% against the Celtics.</p>

<p>I think the Knicks are a 2nd round team&hellip;&hellip; they matchup really poorly against the Bucks and the Magic. If I&rsquo;m the Knicks I&rsquo;m more scared of the Magic than the Celtics&hellip;&hellip; they&rsquo;re a really tough matchup for them.</p>

      <label for="lqz63pa" class="commentText"><p>I just think the Knicks are a tad overrated and are going to get bounced in the 2nd round. The defense took a HUGE step back this offseason. They probably will hang around 12-14 in defense.</p>

<p>They will rely too much on Brunson in the playoffs to create for the team, and I think the Magic defense which is incredibly physical will be too much for Brunson to handle.</p>

<p>Brunson can&rsquo;t handle that level of physicality that the Magic brings and KAT can be shut down by the Magic interior defense (Jon Isaac, WCJ, Wagner, etc)</p>

<p>Knicks still don&rsquo;t have secondary offensive initiator who can take pressure off Brunson. KAT is not that guy and Mikal and OG are just spot up guys.</p>

<p>I just don’t think I need to discuss orlando threatening ny we are going to have to agree to disagree on that one. Orlando needs to worry about scoring the ball and keeping up with the top offensive teams in the east if they wanna be in these convos.</p>

      <label for="lqz7y9e" class="commentText"><p>I think Mikal can do a bit with the ball but not under intense ball pressure. Like if Suggs is on Brunson and they slap KCP/Franz Wagner on Mikal its gonna be tough for Mikal to really do anything.</p>

<p>Taking away Hartenstein/DDV on defense and adding KAT/Mikal isn&rsquo;t an equal exchange. The former 2 were way better on defense than the latter 2. KAT is just a below average rim prescence and your defense can&rsquo;t rely on two wings to do it all.</p>

<p>I personally think the Knicks defense is going to be mediocre this season, but at the end of the day we should agree to disagree.</p>

Weren’t you hyping up the Cavs… please the Cavs did nothing in the off season… Cavs have two small guards who don’t play defense,  two big guys who are extremely limited on offense, play like trash at the end of the year… and you mention none of that but speak about all that could go wrong with Knicks, both your guards are injury prone, your main defensive stopper can not shoot. Strus is a liability on defense and if his 3s are not falling he shouldn’t be on the floor, all you have is a limited 2 guard who doesn’t make anyone better as your star player… stop worrying about the Knicks, the Knicks and Cavs don’t play in the same division</p>

      <label for="lqzx2wo" class="commentText"><p>Well I don&rsquo;t have an issue with the Knicks, I think they&rsquo;re just overhyped and are a 2nd round team. Which is fine.</p>

<p>I think even if the Cavs have 2 small guards the defense is clearly not an issue&hellip;.. the offense is hit or miss depending on the shooting but I think they showed enough last postseason for me to put them slightly higher than the Knicks.</p>

<p>Strus isn&rsquo;t a liability on defense, I&rsquo;m not sure why you would think so. He&rsquo;s a great 3-D player even if he&rsquo;s not an elite defensive guy like OG or Jrue. Closer to DDV.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s bad that Mobley can&rsquo;t shoot. It&rsquo;s not enough to beat the Celtics but they&rsquo;re still an elite team.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Spida is limited and doesn&rsquo;t make anyone better lol. Frankly that&rsquo;s a silly take that&rsquo;s not founded in reality.</p>

<p>Also I&rsquo;m not a Cavs fan, I&rsquo;m just providing objective analysis. I&rsquo;m sorry that it hurts your feelings.</p>

<p>The Cavs at least have Garland next to Spida, and Strus for some 3&amp;D options.</p>

      <label for="lqz8ufk" class="commentText"><p>Problem with the current cavs team is that it looks better on paper than it does on the court, they&rsquo;re supposed to play like a great team but they keep falling short. All of your support players need to take a jump for this current team to work.</p>

<p>I agree, Knicks use Brunson way too much, but after this offseason, even if Brunson is not available, they got Bridges and Kat, who both were first options on their teams for a good while, they&rsquo;re proven to be able to lead (Kat def needed help tho) and I feel like if not for Injuries, this team has a real shot</p>

      <label for="lqzbpud" class="commentText"><p>I actually don&rsquo;t think the Cavs fell short of expectations last season, unless injuries become a serious concern for the players moving forward.</p>

<p>If Spida were healthy they would have taken the Celtics to 6 and possibly 7, which is kind of the ceiling you&rsquo;d expect for the team as constructed.</p>

<p>Most people are indeed kind of expecting some sort of improvement from Mobley who was paid this offseason. His year 3 was underwhelming offensively however there was a noticeable improvement in 3pt% and FT%.</p>

<p>I think the Cavs probably never gets past Celtics without some serious shooting luck, but they&rsquo;re the favourites for a reason.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Bridges is a 1st option. Once the defense turns up he doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to create for himself or teammates. Mikal Bridges is probably the single most overrated player the last few years. His Nets season exposed him so much.</p>

<p>I think KAT can be a secondary option but he&rsquo;s also going to face some very difficult matchups in the East.</p>

<p>No more Nurkic and Gafford- those are fine defensive centers, but now KAT has to handle the Celtics, Cavs, Heat and Magic defense.</p>

<p>Mavs are 100% a better regular season team but in the playoffs when
Luka, Kyrie, PJ and Gafford/Lively are all playing 40+ minutes per game the gap is so obviously a 3&amp;D wing. Klay is no longer a good defender and Grimes/Marshall are less reliable 3 pt shooters. In the regular season you can solve by committee but in the playoffs you want both in 1 player</p>

Yes his defense leaves a lot to be desired but in that Celtics series, it just seemed like the Mavs missed all their open 3’s which allowed the Celtics to collapse heavily on the Luka/Lively PnR and that really affected the offense.</p>

Shit, Klays a better defender than THJ too.</p>
