      <label for="ls3vhwf" class="commentText"><p>A lot of the injuries nowadays come from the focus on a single sport growing up and the crazy high mileage these kids are putting on themselves as opposed to prior generations when guys were multi sport athletes and there wasn&rsquo;t the crazy travel ball/AAU workloads.</p>

<p>This article on it from 2019 was pretty great:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis" target="_blank">https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis</a></p>

<p>Quote from in the article talking about assessing teens:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t be peaking at 16 or 17,&rdquo; Elliott says later. &ldquo;But I can tell you from a data standpoint, you can make a case for it. And you talk to the individual athletes, a whole lot of them will tell you, &lsquo;Oh, when I was a senior in high school is when I was jumping my best. I was moving my best.&rsquo; A lot of guys will tell that story. It just shouldn&rsquo;t be that way. It should happen at 23, 24, 25, but with most of these kids, that&rsquo;s not the case.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="ls3zdjj" class="commentText"><p>Well if you’re making that point, then I’d argue it’s a systemic issue.</p>

<p>These kids HAVE to go 110% so young because they need to be “NBA-ready” by like 17 years old to make it.</p>

<p>Since talent goes one-and-done nowadays, instead of the traditional 4 years in college, what time is there to dedicate towards rest and recovery.</p>

<p>Gotta keep training, working out, playing. Gotta push it. Pedal to the metal or else there is no NBA end-goal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it means a shortened athletic prime, and probably a ton of potential talent never realized because of career-ending injuries at early stages.</p>

      <label for="ls44k2s" class="commentText"><p>Yes it&rsquo;s 100% a systemic issue, but it&rsquo;s still possible for parents to educate themselves on this stuff and try to create a safer environment if they have a kid that&rsquo;s this caliber of player. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s quite realistic to expect average hoops parents to understand this stuff on a deeper level and have the type of foresight to create a perfect plan, but I do think the resources are at least available to the masses which is a start.</p>

      <label for="ls454rc" class="commentText"><p>Is it possible, though?</p>

<p>The time allocated towards providing proper rest and recovery could be opportunity cost that’s otherwise spent improving and showcasing talent.</p>

<p>My premise is that it’s a shitty tradeoff. Parents may not have the choice of ensuring that these kids are developing for a long term career, because it may jeopardize their ability to play professional ball.</p>

      <label for="ls46ox2" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a player development coach and through some of the research I&rsquo;ve done in terms of training methods and from what I&rsquo;ve witnessed coaching at the youth and HS/prep levels, yes it&rsquo;s very very possible. The grind culture of America is partially the issue and everyone is so brainwashed to really understand that there are better ways.</p>

<p>I dont have any kids, but when I do I&rsquo;m like 100% confident I could get my kid a scholarship. Maybe he&rsquo;s not tall enough to make it to the league or doesn&rsquo;t end up in the luckiest circumstances, (idk just building in argument-safeguards before someone comes in crucifying me lol) but yeah I could definitely take a &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; approach and get him to be a very talented, healthy player.</p>

<p>The information is out there, but ppl are really brainwashed by American culture and the AAU monopoly has induced some very real FOMO effects. They make everyone think their hands are tied and that they just have to throw their kid into the meat grinder to have a chance.</p>

<p>Edit: Typo&rsquo;s +</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all guesswork with everyone involved and their solution is to just grind kids into the dust. That&rsquo;s what upsets me. If the adults were interested in doing more research they would discover much more efficient and enjoyable methods for their kids to be even better players. Cheaper probably too. That&rsquo;s the real issue, youth basketball has become a gigantic money-grab and parents are just throwing money at the problem and not realizing they can get better results for cheaper.</p>

<p>But yeah, the American youth system is fucking chaotic; some of the shit I would see was wild how they treat kids this way. A lot of it is just coaches and parents that dont know any better and when I would try and voice some of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned thru research, I could just hear in their responses how much they just couldnt really understand that there are much much better ways to develop kids.</p>

<p>I try to do my part, but it really is just a whole culture of systemic brainwashing that&rsquo;s gonna need some nation-wide organization to undo.</p>

      <label for="ls4zxa4" class="commentText"><p>Yes, look at Europe. There isn&rsquo;t the same crazy AAU and youth sports system there, but they produce fantastic players. Look at guys like Luka and Wemby.</p>

<p>I saw a podcast about this, and there are definitely alternatives. Instead of joining 10 tournaments, join just 2. Instead of focusing only on 1 sport from 2 years old, start with gymnastics, play multiple sports, and only specialize in late high school / college.</p>

<p>I think this fixation on one sport and starting too young is actually detrimental to a player&rsquo;s development. Parents ABSOLUTELY do have a choice, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re choosing to wreck their kids.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested, I can go more into detail about the training methods that are much more efficient and how they would create more mentally healthy, physically healthy and more skilled players in the long run. In fact, here&rsquo;s a hint lol look up the guy who was just hired as the Cavalier&rsquo;s Director of Player Development, Alex Sarama. He&rsquo;s been a pioneer in using a more modern approach to Player Development that truthfully should be the standard for youth basketball especially.</p>

<p>Kids realllllly dont need to be playing crazy amounts of AAU from 4th grade on. Personally I would suggest holding off on it until like the summer after freshman or sophomore year, or if they&rsquo;re going to play earlier, having intentional training plans in the offseason and telling their AAU teams that they will play in just 4 out of the 8 tournaments on schedule or something like that. Or &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just going to come to practices and then play in 2 tournaments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Added to that, teams are going to stop trying to do this double timeline thing, and start drafting 3 or 4 year players who are ready to make an impact, like Jaquez.</p>

He has convinced the coach to expand the roster and limit the minutes of everyone, especially the tournaments where they play 3 games in one day.  Most of the kids play multiple sports too but that’s because they’re from a small town and it’s pretty much needed.</p>

<p>The coach played college ball and was a multi sport star so he fully understands.</p>

<p>Until then (if that ever happens), the best you&rsquo;ll get is individual cases where a young player has the stars align and has a great support system all the way up to his NBA journey where the parents are smart enough to keep their kid playing multiple sports and stay away from falling for the AAU scams until he&rsquo;s 15-16.</p>

A lot of greats are great because they competed another sport and whatever they gained from that sport, it complimented the sport they went pro in. When I played basketball in high school sometimes I was battling someone and we were going back and forth but they just had that little bit or cardio than me or jumped a little higher. They always did track.</p>

This theory is the same as all of the other theories in that it’s correct, but it’s not the whole explanation and there is no single explanation for injury and performance in sports.</p>

<p>I don’t know why someone always has to say “this is the answer”.  It’s not.  There’s tons of answers for injuries in sports.  Any single injury is the culmination of many reasons.</p>

Less is more, but ppl arent doing their due diligence to do the research and figure it all out. Not necessarily speaking on the guys that are getting hurt in the league now, but yeah that article came out in 2019 and theres other research that&rsquo;s been done in the last decade that&rsquo;s a game changer in terms of player development.</p>

<p>Kids getting roped into this shitty system nowadays is really a byproduct of the adults in their lives not doing their due diligence and it sucks. Parents, coaches, skills trainers, S&amp;C/performance coaches all need to start pulling their weight more and advising these kids better and keeping their bodies safer.</p>

      <label for="ls42ius" class="commentText"><p>I think people (including former players) are underrating how grueling the game is these days.</p>

<p>The explosion of the 3pt shot has resulted in the game having significantly more space, which means you need more explosive movements to create space and close space. Not to mention, the skill threshold increasing means dudes have to do even more these days to succeed (in both a macro and micro sense).</p>

<p>Like, think how much force is generated in current eurosteps or step backs. The ground dudes cover is insane. That only happens because dudes are creating sufficient force to change directions so drastically.</p>

<p>Not to mention non-centers are probably bigger/heavier these days than they used to be, which only compounds the issue (because now they need even MORE force to move themselves).</p>

      <label for="ls48j2w" class="commentText"><p>Ive firmly believed for a number of years that its the number of hard lateral cuts that lead to major soft tissue injuries. Think cross overs and sudden change of direction when guarding someone. With space and pace, there is more of it. It also means more sprints and fatigue which is when you&rsquo;re likely to take bad steps or be off balance in general.</p>

<p>The game for so many years was iso heavy when 4 players basically stood around and moved very little.</p>

<p>Cutting has always been a fundamental part of the game.</p>

<p>You could just as easily argue the opposite here. Game is easier on the body because dudes are just standing around the 3-point line and physical post play is all but dead.</p>

<p>Besides - even if it were true, today’s players are supposedly stronger, so it shouldn’t matter. Their bodies would be well developed for it.</p>

      <label for="ls4p2df" class="commentText"><p>The quick change of momentum in lateral movements is tougher on the tendons than post play. When ur posting up, youre requiring more strength sure but its less on the tendons. If anything, dudes were standing more on the 3 point line in decades past. Pure 3 point specialists dont exist nowadays, theyre also asked to play passable defense and be a driving threat now. If u are not, u wont get nba minutes. Look at jimmer fredette and look how quickly he got out of the league because he was too static of a player. Look at duncan robinson during 2022 vs 2023, he was getting limited minutes in 2022 playoffs and max strus was playing over him, until Drob developed those other skills</p>

Cutting has always been fundamental but the sheer number of cutting &amp; pivoting movements made by each athlete is certainly higher today.</p>

<p>All those post ups in the earlier decades are gone now and while posting up has that sumo style athleticism to it, those arent the possessions that basketball players typically get hurt in. Basketball players get hurt mostly in landing phases and during cutting movements. Without all those stagnant post ups, and all the conceptual offenses that teams are playing today, I&rsquo;d 100% bet that there are more cuts are made on average in 2024 than in the 90&rsquo;s.

<p>The human body is not actually meant to play sports so even tho players train for injury prevention and whatnot, the movements in basketball are just always going to put a toll on the body. There&rsquo;s also the discussion above about how early specialization in sports leads to greater wear and tear at younger ages for these athletes. Theres a lot more basketball miles on some of these guys bodies at younger ages than in decades past.</p>

      <label for="ls4yayf" class="commentText"><p>Watch a game from the 1980s: most of the action occurs within like 17 feet.</p>

<p>Compare that to today — half of the players are outside the 3pt arc, some by a substantial margin.</p>

<p>But helping is still just as prevalent (probably even more so), so dudes are having to cover significantly more ground to collapse down and then close back out to shooters, then sink their hips and backpedal if they pump and go.</p>

<p>Dudes are also both faster AND better at stopping on a dime to pull up (or do giant step backs).</p>

<p>All of it is places a far larger emphasis on EXPLOSIVE movements and acceleration/deceleration rather than simple agility (or even physical strength, like post play). This places much more strain on the tendons/ligaments.</p>

<p>Like, look at the NFL. An analysis was conducted on the positions with the most frequent ACL tears. The two positions with the highest frequency? Linebackers and WRs, two positions with a really high rate of explosive movements. Running backs had nearly 60% of the tears that offensive lineman have despite there being only 1 RB on the field at a time (sometimes fewer) and there being 5 OL on the field every single play.</p>

<p>If fans are paying money from their own pockets to see YOU play, you play, this league is nothing without fans.</p>

<p>Honestly part of the reason why players are so injury-prone nowadays is overuse from when they are children onwards. It literally never gets talked about tho but it’s the truth and look no further than Lamelo and Lonzo Ball as an example. Never played any other sports, trained at least 3 hours a day, 365 days a year for a decade straight for only basketball. That fucks up your body once you get to a more physical level. Players growing up in the 70s, 80s and 90s were multi-sport athletes and did not train every damn day of their lives to that extent for one specific sport.</p>

<p>it should be more important for aspiring professionals to play multiple sports / build a strong athletic foundation that doesn&rsquo;t involve the weight room than doing professional level sport specific training</p>

<p>I think this is one of the reasons so many Euro players are gaining an edge on american basketball players, is that they are not getting trapped in the elite training and instead live more natural, fluid athletic lifestyles like also playing futbol, etc</p>

      <label for="ls4fx36" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi is in a different category.  He’s like a Bill Walton injury prone superstar player.  The reality is that Kawhi literally needs load management because his knees just can’t handle pro ball.  He either needs that or to come off the Bench like Bill Walton did.  I don’t think all these guys are as injury prone as Kawhi with his 85 year old knees.  I do think the AAU stuff impacts them negatively, but there has to be another reason in the training</p>

      <label for="ls43kgy" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not effort it&rsquo;s the geometry. Players used to be able to just sit inside the three point line and not do anything opposite side of the action. All the stand still post entries go away and now everything is pnr. Everything is out to the three point line. While Fox and Sabonis run pnr they got Monk, Huerter or Murray coming off screens opposite side. Every big has to move on the perimeter. The closeouts are farther and more desperate. Transition defense is a nightmare. Etc.</p>

      <label for="ls3y57k" class="commentText"><p>the caveat here is that, if you *have been* injured, coming back with a minutes restriction and a b2b restriction makes a ton of sense.  Like Jamal Murray in 2023, coming off of a year and a half off due to his ACL tear.  It&rsquo;s not a binary &ldquo;healthy enough to play&rdquo; or &ldquo;injured and sits&rdquo;; there are conditioning and recovery concerns as well, and sometimes a player is in one of those in-between spots where it&rsquo;s good for both them and the team to play but not big minutes and maybe not every game.</p>

<p>60 his third year.</p>

<p>Starting with the 92-93 season, he played: 46, 62, 25 and 55 games.</p>

<p>Finished up his last two seasons with 47 games and then 20.</p>

<p>Joel Embiid has never played more than 68 games in a season. Embiid average 54 games per season, if you include the first two years that he sat out, he averaged 43 games per season.</p>

I don’t really think Embiid is load managing in the sense that the Spurs or LeBron were. Embiid does have a long rap sheet of injuries, some of them are fluky (markelle breaking embiid’s face being one of them)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And to put in perspective, that game was like the Spurs 4th in 5 nights on a roadtrip or something ridiculous like that. It was an FU to the league for shitty scheduling. (But I also think it was a strategic element before a potential finals rematch: basically not giving Spo a chance to see our full lineup against theirs)</p>

<p>then this reddit comment says the term seems to originate with reference to Embiid:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed. Spurs introduced a kind of proto-“load management” before there was a term for it, in the latter part of Duncan’s career. Term itself seems to originate (in the context of NBA) in ‘17 with 76ers resting Embiid.</p>

<p>it helped him though that the team was good enough from like 2012 - 2016 that he didn&rsquo;t have to play a ton. I remember in 2013 and 2014 the big three often sat most of the third and the entire fourth quarter because they&rsquo;d blow out a lot of teams.</p>

<p>Mullin played 16 years in the League, so he has some credibility here regarding durability.</p>

<p>The most compelling argument I&rsquo;ve heard for lower durability in recent years is that the level of training earlier in top players&rsquo; development (i.e. AAU) is much higher now, leading to more miles on the body by the time a top player even reaches the NBA.</p>

Half court offenses used to be slow as shit with guys just standing around while a star player iso&rsquo;d a large amount of the time. Today&rsquo;s half court offenses involve a lot of running even off ball. The pace may be comparable, but the speed and distance are not.</p>

The ability to focus on a particular muscle I believe does more bad than good. Our bodies muscles work together and when one is stronger or weaker than the other I think it causes injury</p>

      <label for="ls59zmb" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think there’s any single right answer and it’s a decision to be made in conjunction with trainers and team doctors. I’m sure Mullin understands what a season takes far better than I ever will but ultimately I think it’s more of a question for professionals. They won’t be perfect, but you’d hope their expertise leads to the right outcome most of the time.</p>

Seems like a pattern with a lot of players  today.  Joel Embid is super soft can you imagine Shaq saying that!!</p>
