      <label for="ls3vhwf" class="commentText"><p>A lot of the injuries nowadays come from the focus on a single sport growing up and the crazy high mileage these kids are putting on themselves as opposed to prior generations when guys were multi sport athletes and there wasn&rsquo;t the crazy travel ball/AAU workloads.</p>

<p>This article on it from 2019 was pretty great:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis" target="_blank">https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis</a></p>

<p>Quote from in the article talking about assessing teens:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t be peaking at 16 or 17,&rdquo; Elliott says later. &ldquo;But I can tell you from a data standpoint, you can make a case for it. And you talk to the individual athletes, a whole lot of them will tell you, &lsquo;Oh, when I was a senior in high school is when I was jumping my best. I was moving my best.&rsquo; A lot of guys will tell that story. It just shouldn&rsquo;t be that way. It should happen at 23, 24, 25, but with most of these kids, that&rsquo;s not the case.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="ls3zdjj" class="commentText"><p>Well if you’re making that point, then I’d argue it’s a systemic issue.</p>

<p>These kids HAVE to go 110% so young because they need to be “NBA-ready” by like 17 years old to make it.</p>

<p>Since talent goes one-and-done nowadays, instead of the traditional 4 years in college, what time is there to dedicate towards rest and recovery.</p>

<p>Gotta keep training, working out, playing. Gotta push it. Pedal to the metal or else there is no NBA end-goal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it means a shortened athletic prime, and probably a ton of potential talent never realized because of career-ending injuries at early stages.</p>

      <label for="ls44k2s" class="commentText"><p>Yes it&rsquo;s 100% a systemic issue, but it&rsquo;s still possible for parents to educate themselves on this stuff and try to create a safer environment if they have a kid that&rsquo;s this caliber of player. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s quite realistic to expect average hoops parents to understand this stuff on a deeper level and have the type of foresight to create a perfect plan, but I do think the resources are at least available to the masses which is a start.</p>

      <label for="ls454rc" class="commentText"><p>Is it possible, though?</p>

<p>The time allocated towards providing proper rest and recovery could be opportunity cost that’s otherwise spent improving and showcasing talent.</p>

<p>My premise is that it’s a shitty tradeoff. Parents may not have the choice of ensuring that these kids are developing for a long term career, because it may jeopardize their ability to play professional ball.</p>

      <label for="ls46ox2" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a player development coach and through some of the research I&rsquo;ve done in terms of training methods and from what I&rsquo;ve witnessed coaching at the youth and HS/prep levels, yes it&rsquo;s very very possible. The grind culture of America is partially the issue and everyone is so brainwashed to really understand that there are better ways.</p>

<p>I dont have any kids, but when I do I&rsquo;m like 100% confident I could get my kid a scholarship. Maybe he&rsquo;s not tall enough to make it to the league or doesn&rsquo;t end up in the luckiest circumstances, (idk just building in argument-safeguards before someone comes in crucifying me lol) but yeah I could definitely take a &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; approach and get him to be a very talented, healthy player.</p>

<p>The information is out there, but ppl are really brainwashed by American culture and the AAU monopoly has induced some very real FOMO effects. They make everyone think their hands are tied and that they just have to throw their kid into the meat grinder to have a chance.</p>

<p>Edit: Typo&rsquo;s +</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all guesswork with everyone involved and their solution is to just grind kids into the dust. That&rsquo;s what upsets me. If the adults were interested in doing more research they would discover much more efficient and enjoyable methods for their kids to be even better players. Cheaper probably too. That&rsquo;s the real issue, youth basketball has become a gigantic money-grab and parents are just throwing money at the problem and not realizing they can get better results for cheaper.</p>

<p>But yeah, the American youth system is fucking chaotic; some of the shit I would see was wild how they treat kids this way. A lot of it is just coaches and parents that dont know any better and when I would try and voice some of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned thru research, I could just hear in their responses how much they just couldnt really understand that there are much much better ways to develop kids.</p>

<p>I try to do my part, but it really is just a whole culture of systemic brainwashing that&rsquo;s gonna need some nation-wide organization to undo.</p>

      <label for="ls5u8zg" class="commentText"><p>Isn&rsquo;t the latest on &ldquo;better ways&rdquo; not that less is more, but that varied physical activity seemingly unrelated to the principal sport is more? Most parents I know are getting their kids a year or two in gymnastics, followed by martial arts, overlapping with rock climbing, some basketball and soccer, etc. The kids are pushed just as hard as anything from my generation, just pushed in a variety of different ways. But I suspect the approach to training kids is different from the approach to training young adults trying to get a scholarship.</p>

      <label for="ls5z8vc" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m talking more about how I would raise and train my kid if I had one born tomorrow. Most parents aren&rsquo;t really aware or ignore some of the research about how to not &ldquo;push their kids too hard&rdquo; and also develop elite athletes. I know, easier said than done, and this is coming from me having the background that I do, not some random dad that hooped a little back in the day.</p>

<p>What I would do:</p>

<p><strong>Tl;dr: 1) From an early age, model the sport for him to get him wanting to imitate what he sees and build intrinsic motivation to play because that leads to sustained motivation over the course of his life. 2) Ages 1-12 has a certain window to build athleticism that cannot be made up for later in life; maximize this window creatively. 3) Specialize at the right age, probably even have him play multiple sports throughout HS considering he&rsquo;ll probably be far ahead of his peers because of the other factors I list. 4) Targeted Player Development since birth utilizing the Constraints-Led Approach (CLA). I pretty much guarantee my kid would be a scholarship level player at least, barring freak injuries/life being crazy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1) Ignition/Inception:</strong> I would not actually force my kid to do anything, play any certain sport, etc. You gotta make it all fun for them and just implant certain motivational seeds that would make him lean towards your sport. So being a hooper, I&rsquo;d play pickup or in men&rsquo;s leagues and bring my kid so he&rsquo;s always seeing me play and as a coach I&rsquo;d bring him to practices with me fairly often so he&rsquo;s always around the game. Buy a Little Tikes hoop and a ball his size and just leave it around. Bam, kid wants to be a hooper because he&rsquo;s just copying dad and imitating the stuff he&rsquo;s seen. Was never &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to play by dad.</p>

<p><strong>2) Building elite coordination/athleticism:</strong> Research suggests that there is a window from ages 1-12 where kids can make the largest gains in terms of learning movement patterns. Once that window closes, that&rsquo;s where most ppl start to cry about their genes not being good and that that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re not athletic. Genes are important, but this early exposure to different movements and building athletic traits is crucial.</p>

<p>This is where playing other sports comes into play, so yeah I&rsquo;d prob toss my kid into soccer, little league, etc. and see what he likes too. But, the main things I would do are just find him some playmates at an early age that are also active/athletic and encourage him and his friends to play Tag, climb on monkey bars at the playground, jump on tires, have a hoop in the driveway that they can lower and have dunk contests, play two hand touch or flag football.</p>

<p>Fun stuff, but the gains in lateral agility, footwork, spatial awareness, depth perception, general coordination, vertical, etc. will have a tremendous effect on the athletes once they are aged 16 and up. Have them play against older kids when they&rsquo;re young so that they are never the fastest or strongest one and are always pushing the envelope in these areas while also having to problem-solve to win or be effective. Have them play against adults, high level teens or myself in that age 1-12 to get exposure to the highest level of speed/reaction stimuli that they can&rsquo;t get from kids their age.</p>

<p>Yes, genetics are important, but it&rsquo;s really this crucial window that gets missed because kids dont have athletic parents or are spending too much time inside playing video games and not doing regular playground stuff. I&rsquo;d try to give my kid a healthy relationship with technology in terms of limiting screen time as well while teetering that line of not being a complete asshole, play it by ear so to speak.</p>

<p>I also think games like chess and other activities like playing instruments or being artistic would have some great effects on the mind in terms of critical thinking, creativity, imagination, etc. that can help enhance their on-court ability or ability to receive and make sense of coaching.</p>

<p><strong>3) Specialize at the &ldquo;right&rdquo; age:</strong> I think the specified golden number is like 15-16, but I do believe there&rsquo;s some art to that and an individual case by case basis so I might encourage (or force at this point lol now that he&rsquo;s old enough to get the bigger picture) him to play other sports all throughout HS. You hear about all the guys in the NFL who were elite hoopers all throughout HS like CJ Stroud or some that got D1 offers in both sports (or Jalen Suggs on the hooper side). The time away from your main sport is also good for their mental health as well and just getting to be a kid and enjoy different relationships and not just immerse themselves in their main-sport year round which can lead to burnout.</p>

<p><strong>4) Targeted Player Development:</strong> Not going to go too deep into this one because of the skills training and whatnot that&rsquo;s too nuanced considering how long this comment already is lol. Long story short, there is a new coaching method called the Constraints-Led Approach that is basically the new Moneyball revolution in basketball, but hasnt quite caught on yet as much as it should. It makes training fun and it&rsquo;s way more efficient for building skill than the old-school traditional grind methods (boring form shooting, repetitive drills, dribbling thru cones, make 500 shots a day just to still be trash and scared to play against real defenders in games lol).</p>

<p>Prioritizing development at an early age and pretty much skipping out on AAU until he&rsquo;s finished his sophomore year would be my tentative plan. I&rsquo;d invest the money instead on resources like the Vertimax multiple times a week and proper or high level performance training as a teenager. Using my background I&rsquo;d also properly vet different coaches and organizations to be able to figure out what teams my son should be playing for and private coaches he should work with.</p>

<p>Between utilizing the CLA from the time my kid is born to all the different things I laid out in the points above, I&rsquo;m honestly like 100% confident that my kid would at least be a scholarship-level athlete if he&rsquo;s at least like 5&rsquo;9. If he&rsquo;s ~6&rsquo;3+ he&rsquo;ll be a surefire NBA player barring freak injuries/bad luck at the wrong times. Life is crazy lol just throwing in obvious conversational safeguards before someone hops in and tries to crucify me for what I&rsquo;m saying🤷🏿‍♂️</p>

<p>I dont actually care to try and prove anything to some ppl on the internet lol I know the amount of work that I put into my craft and the amount of research that I&rsquo;ve done.

<p>And again, this is just some theoretical conversation, obviously shit happens in real life. Just saying the blueprint is pretty straightforward, though many dont have the knowledge to put it into effect so they make crucial mistakes along the way that would throw huge monkey wrenches into the process and then it&rsquo;s too late to really recover from.</p>

      <label for="ls4zxa4" class="commentText"><p>Yes, look at Europe. There isn&rsquo;t the same crazy AAU and youth sports system there, but they produce fantastic players. Look at guys like Luka and Wemby.</p>

<p>I saw a podcast about this, and there are definitely alternatives. Instead of joining 10 tournaments, join just 2. Instead of focusing only on 1 sport from 2 years old, start with gymnastics, play multiple sports, and only specialize in late high school / college.</p>

<p>I think this fixation on one sport and starting too young is actually detrimental to a player&rsquo;s development. Parents ABSOLUTELY do have a choice, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re choosing to wreck their kids.</p>

<p>FACTS bro. As a coach I interact with it far too often and it&rsquo;s really tiring. I try not to be one that&rsquo;s complaining about parents and arguing with them too much, but the reality is that THESE ARE THEIR KIDS. To me, they need to be doing a lot more in terms of educating themselves and trying to find the best possible avenues for success for THEIR kids.</p>

<p>The kids are kids and they&rsquo;re gonna do what kids do, it&rsquo;s the adults that should have developed enough critical thinking ability to try and find better ways and not just be Karens and rabid animals while not preparing their kids and throwing them into shit situations.</p>

<p>The other issue on the adult side is coaches that are not doing their due diligence as well, but I think thats more of a systemic issue as far as the low barrier (no barrier?) for entry creating an abundance of bad-to-mediocre coaches at the youth level. From what I see and keep hearing, there&rsquo;s such an overwhelming number of dads that are just thrown in as the coach of youth teams or that start their own teams. That type of stuff really shouldnt be happening; everybody&rsquo;s complained about it for ages yet nothings been done.</p>

I mean yes, maybe you are a 7 footer with natural athleticism, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But if you&rsquo;re one of the millions of HS PGs with average to excellent (but not phenomenal/generational) athleticism wouldn&rsquo;t you need every advantage you can get (i.e. from repitition)?</p>

<p>Basically repetition is good but past a certain point there are diminishing returns, and in fact at a developing age, training your muscle memory to shoot in a certain way can lead to broken shots like lonzo balls shot&hellip;. Also repetition in low quality games may be detrimental where they learn lots of bad habits like standing around ball watching or starting to iso or bad defence&hellip; Etc. double edged sword. Having multiple sports may make them more durable or give them a special edge. Obviously again a risk of injury in other sports&hellip;</p>

<p>But it sounds like your advice works for people who have that latent ability for the sport.</p>

<p>But looking at it from the standpoint of the guy who&rsquo;ll grow to be 6&rsquo;1&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t have blistering athleticism and his ceiling is maybe the 15th man on the roster who is only good enough to have on the practice squad and fill out the bench should there be enough injuries.

<p>It&rsquo;s such a nuanced conversation and the individual context of each situation is really what matters the most that your scenario is kind of pointless to address honestly. For the sake of the discussion tho, theoretically that would be the type of kid that you have play multiple sports until he&rsquo;s anywhere from 14-16 before you specialize in a singular sport.</p>

<p>Theoretically if he knows at an early age that basketball is his favorite and he wants to get a scholarship, yes have him play multiple sports and then like the summer after freshman year have him start AAU (conservatively still, he doesnt need to play all 8 tournaments on the schedule) and dropping his spring sport.</p>

<p>There is still a very targeted path that the 6&rsquo;1 kid can take to turn himself into a D1 player without having played AAU and done private skills training since the age of 10. The issue is that he probably has pretty average parents that don&rsquo;t know any better and don&rsquo;t really have the foresight, knowledge or basketball talent/teaching ability themselves to get him to be a D1 player.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested, I can go more into detail about the training methods that are much more efficient and how they would create more mentally healthy, physically healthy and more skilled players in the long run. In fact, here&rsquo;s a hint lol look up the guy who was just hired as the Cavalier&rsquo;s Director of Player Development, Alex Sarama. He&rsquo;s been a pioneer in using a more modern approach to Player Development that truthfully should be the standard for youth basketball especially.</p>

<p>Kids realllllly dont need to be playing crazy amounts of AAU from 4th grade on. Personally I would suggest holding off on it until like the summer after freshman or sophomore year, or if they&rsquo;re going to play earlier, having intentional training plans in the offseason and telling their AAU teams that they will play in just 4 out of the 8 tournaments on schedule or something like that. Or &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just going to come to practices and then play in 2 tournaments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seriously, it&rsquo;s all out there.

I would argue that it&rsquo;s more their responsibility to go looking for this information, but I know how ppl are so maybe that&rsquo;s not realistic.</p>

<p>You can absolutely get a college scholarship without playing 4 AAU tournaments every week for 5 years straight. Even in North America. The system encourages kids to play games non-stop starting from like grade 5, instead of focusing on skill development.</p>

<p>Or if the parents are crazy, they play games starting from grade 5 AND ALSO try and grind them down with skill development. It&rsquo;s ok to give these kids time to blossom. People think if the kid isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;NBA ready&rdquo; by 18 they never will be, but teams are clearly willing to invest in guys who at 18 may not be ready to be stars, but have the potential to grow into them given continued development, such as all the guys I named (except Luka, who was a prodigy).</p>

<p>Canadians such as Shai, Jamal Murray, Zach Edey. These guys played a bit of club/travel ball but nowhere near many American kids. Edey, Shai and Embiid even played HS ball in the USA for a few years.</p>

<p>Exactly, ppl just stick their head in the sand and keep trying to argue what they BELIEVE to be true instead of just accepting that there are legitimately better methods and putting their time and energy into seeking those out to get even better results than the current model.</p>

<p>I get it, it&rsquo;s not like common widespread info, but if I was a parent that&rsquo;s supposedly so invested in my kid making it far in hoops, I would be scouring the earth to find the best methods possible, not throwing my kid into the meat grinder like everyone else.</p>

<p>Zig while everyone else zags, so to speak. If you&rsquo;re trying to get to the highest level and do something extraordinary, does it really make  sense to do the same things as everyone else?</p>

      <label for="ls7dt57" class="commentText"><p>Is this an argument about not needing AAU to develop as a player or to get noticed? Because I strongly agree with the development aspect, but outside of Shai, who pretty much did go through a traditional route, those other dudes didn&rsquo;t exactly have a normal route to the NBA that most players can replicate. And three of them are essentially 7ft tall. I&rsquo;d wager an average sized PG probably has to do all he can to separate himself from the other 6&rsquo;1-6&rsquo;4 athletic guys that started dunking when they were 14.</p>

One of those was playing professional ball at 16 ( luka). One of them got drafted 55th overall. A few more slots down or someone not taking the chance on him, and maybe he winds up being a phenomenal euroleague player who everyone says would be a role player in the NBA</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people on the internet without a formal education do things that people in my line of work (with a college degree) couldn&rsquo;t dream of. could anyone have gotten to their level without the degree and spending tens of thousands of dollars (obviously yes, they did it). Is it a lot easier and likelier to happen if you  spend the money and get the degree, also yes.</p>

<p>Added to that, teams are going to stop trying to do this double timeline thing, and start drafting 3 or 4 year players who are ready to make an impact, like Jaquez.</p>

<p>Derozan is another notable example of longevity (he also went through the AAU circuit) and i think its because his footwork is so refined.  He’s said in multiple interviews he doesn’t even tie his shoes during games, which says to me he’s not putting a ton of twisting or angular force on his knees/legs at all.</p>

<p>It is easy as an outside to go, &ldquo;put yoru kids in multipel sports and don&rsquo;t let them practice too much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cool&hellip; then they don&rsquo;t make the soccer team because everyone else on the team specialized playing year round and are better than your kid. Will they burn out sooner in their early 20&rsquo;s? Sure&hellip; but it is too late for YOUR kid who got cut from his HS team and now his soccer &ldquo;career&rdquo; is done.</p>

<p>These kids HAVE to go 110% so young because they need to be “NBA-ready” by like 17 years old to make it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For real, kids are thinking if you aren&rsquo;t looking at getting drafted after your freshmen college season you must not be an NBA player so I can understand them wanting to be 100%+ at 17 years old</p>

<p>As an ex BIG college basketball fan the one-and-done era has really decreased the quality of the college game. I still follow and watch the tournament but it&rsquo;s not the same as it used to be where you had the best teams with 3-4 NBA prospect juniors or seniors in their starting lineup</p>

He has convinced the coach to expand the roster and limit the minutes of everyone, especially the tournaments where they play 3 games in one day.  Most of the kids play multiple sports too but that’s because they’re from a small town and it’s pretty much needed.</p>

<p>The coach played college ball and was a multi sport star so he fully understands.</p>

<p>We propose 2 games in 2 days and 2 games on the third (4 games in 3 days) and they throw a fit. They want double that - even though it costs double, they don’t care.</p>

<p>Parents ask us for 3+ per day for 3 days in a row. It’s fucking crazy. These kids are beat to shit by the end of the first day. Like 10 year olds with ice bags on all their joints, popping Ibuprofen like it’s candy, and walking around the gym like a 90 year old.</p>

<p>Until then (if that ever happens), the best you&rsquo;ll get is individual cases where a young player has the stars align and has a great support system all the way up to his NBA journey where the parents are smart enough to keep their kid playing multiple sports and stay away from falling for the AAU scams until he&rsquo;s 15-16.</p>

A lot of greats are great because they competed another sport and whatever they gained from that sport, it complimented the sport they went pro in.

<p>Kids getting roped into this shitty system nowadays is really a byproduct of the adults in their lives not doing their due diligence and it sucks. Parents, coaches, skills trainers, S&amp;C/performance coaches all need to start pulling their weight more and advising these kids better and keeping their bodies safer.</p>

<p>I don’t know why someone always has to say “this is the answer”.  It’s not.  There’s tons of answers for injuries in sports.  Any single injury is the culmination of many reasons.</p>

      <label for="ls42ius" class="commentText"><p>I think people (including former players) are underrating how grueling the game is these days.</p>

<p>The explosion of the 3pt shot has resulted in the game having significantly more space, which means you need more explosive movements to create space and close space. Not to mention, the skill threshold increasing means dudes have to do even more these days to succeed (in both a macro and micro sense).</p>

<p>Like, think how much force is generated in current eurosteps or step backs. The ground dudes cover is insane. That only happens because dudes are creating sufficient force to change directions so drastically.</p>

<p>Not to mention non-centers are probably bigger/heavier these days than they used to be, which only compounds the issue (because now they need even MORE force to move themselves).</p>

      <label for="ls48j2w" class="commentText"><p>Ive firmly believed for a number of years that its the number of hard lateral cuts that lead to major soft tissue injuries. Think cross overs and sudden change of direction when guarding someone. With space and pace, there is more of it. It also means more sprints and fatigue which is when you&rsquo;re likely to take bad steps or be off balance in general.</p>

<p>The game for so many years was iso heavy when 4 players basically stood around and moved very little.</p>

<p>Cutting has always been a fundamental part of the game.</p>

<p>You could just as easily argue the opposite here. Game is easier on the body because dudes are just standing around the 3-point line and physical post play is all but dead.</p>

<p>Besides - even if it were true, today’s players are supposedly stronger, so it shouldn’t matter. Their bodies would be well developed for it.</p>

      <label for="ls4p2df" class="commentText"><p>The quick change of momentum in lateral movements is tougher on the tendons than post play. When ur posting up, youre requiring more strength sure but its less on the tendons. If anything, dudes were standing more on the 3 point line in decades past. Pure 3 point specialists dont exist nowadays, theyre also asked to play passable defense and be a driving threat now. If u are not, u wont get nba minutes. Look at jimmer fredette and look how quickly he got out of the league because he was too static of a player. Look at duncan robinson during 2022 vs 2023, he was getting limited minutes in 2022 playoffs and max strus was playing over him, until Drob developed those other skills</p>

<p>There is 0 evidence to corroborate the OP of this thread’s claim. Believe what you want about faster / more explosive — I actually do not believe that’s the case at all — but there’s no evidence that says injury frequency has increased because of cutting frequency.</p>

<p>Most injuries remain freak accidents due to collisions, etc. If you want to say collision frequency has increased because of more cutting, still — show me the data or preface all your claims with some disclaimer rather than spewing fake information based on your uninformed intuition.</p>

Cutting has always been fundamental but the sheer number of cutting &amp; pivoting movements made by each athlete is certainly higher today.</p>

<p>All those post ups in the earlier decades are gone now and while posting up has that sumo style athleticism to it, those arent the possessions that basketball players typically get hurt in. Basketball players get hurt mostly in landing phases and during cutting movements. Without all those stagnant post ups, and all the conceptual offenses that teams are playing today, I&rsquo;d 100% bet that there are more cuts are made on average in 2024 than in the 90&rsquo;s.

<p>The human body is not actually meant to play sports so even tho players train for injury prevention and whatnot, the movements in basketball are just always going to put a toll on the body. There&rsquo;s also the discussion above about how early specialization in sports leads to greater wear and tear at younger ages for these athletes. Theres a lot more basketball miles on some of these guys bodies at younger ages than in decades past.</p>

Just look at how many plays are happening in a given possession in modern NBA, like a pick and roll and 2 other off ball screens at all in one play.

<p>Compare that to today — half of the players are outside the 3pt arc, some by a substantial margin.</p>

<p>But helping is still just as prevalent (probably even more so), so dudes are having to cover significantly more ground to collapse down and then close back out to shooters, then sink their hips and backpedal if they pump and go.</p>

<p>Dudes are also both faster AND better at stopping on a dime to pull up (or do giant step backs).</p>

<p>All of it is places a far larger emphasis on EXPLOSIVE movements and acceleration/deceleration rather than simple agility (or even physical strength, like post play). This places much more strain on the tendons/ligaments.</p>

<p>Like, look at the NFL. An analysis was conducted on the positions with the most frequent ACL tears. The two positions with the highest frequency? Linebackers and WRs, two positions with a really high rate of explosive movements. Running backs had nearly 60% of the tears that offensive lineman have despite there being only 1 RB on the field at a time (sometimes fewer) and there being 5 OL on the field every single play.</p>

<p>How do you determine which injuries are freak occurrences and which ones are from overuse? I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite that binary. The same amount of force applied to the same joint could cause very different severities of injuries depending on how fatigued or overused it is at that moment.</p>

<p>However us plebs don&rsquo;t have access to all the data nba teams have. I strongly suspect that the mileage ran over the course of a season is actually not that impactful in terms of injury. I suspect that jumping (even small jumps for jump shots or big jumps for dunks and blocks) plays a way bigger role in injuries than anticipated. This is just my educated guess tho.</p>

<p>So in this case, there are so many questions left unanswered. And there&rsquo;s no financial incentive to answer them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is a player more likely to get injured in the last few mins of a game. Where legs are tired. Or are they more likely to get injured, their first time subbed into a game. Where they are still trying to get their bearings?</p></li>

<li><p>Player A plays on a B2B. Plays 20 mins each game. Player B does not play B2B. Plays 40 mins in one game. Who is more likely to get injured?</p></li>

<p>If fans are paying money from their own pockets to see YOU play, you play, this league is nothing without fans.</p>

<p>Honestly part of the reason why players are so injury-prone nowadays is overuse from when they are children onwards. It literally never gets talked about tho but it’s the truth and look no further than Lamelo and Lonzo Ball as an example. Never played any other sports, trained at least 3 hours a day, 365 days a year for a decade straight for only basketball. That fucks up your body once you get to a more physical level. Players growing up in the 70s, 80s and 90s were multi-sport athletes and did not train every damn day of their lives to that extent for one specific sport.</p>

      <label for="ls3yqyc" class="commentText"><p>Funnily enough it was MJ who said that first, that he tried to play every game especially away games because he knew some people would only show up once in their entire lives just to see him, and he felt he had an obligation there.</p>

<p>MJ ultimately played all 82 games eight times during his 13 years with the Bulls.</p>

<p>the other five were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>18 games when he broke his foot his second year (this was famously the same season where he dropped 63 in the Garden in the playoffs)</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 81 games in 88-89</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 80 games in 91-92</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 78 games in 92-93</p></li>

<li><p>17 games in his comeback season after retirement</p></li>

      <label for="ls3ud2k" class="commentText"><p>yeah there&rsquo;s something to that with the kids training younger, overtraining, and doing specialized or single sport training too early</p>

<p>it should be more important for aspiring professionals to play multiple sports / build a strong athletic foundation that doesn&rsquo;t involve the weight room than doing professional level sport specific training</p>

<p>I think this is one of the reasons so many Euro players are gaining an edge on american basketball players, is that they are not getting trapped in the elite training and instead live more natural, fluid athletic lifestyles like also playing futbol, etc</p>

      <label for="ls4fx36" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi is in a different category.  He’s like a Bill Walton injury prone superstar player.  The reality is that Kawhi literally needs load management because his knees just can’t handle pro ball.  He either needs that or to come off the Bench like Bill Walton did.  I don’t think all these guys are as injury prone as Kawhi with his 85 year old knees.  I do think the AAU stuff impacts them negatively, but there has to be another reason in the training</p>

      <label for="ls5rr56" class="commentText"><p>I don’t see a difference at all.  6 to one, half dozen to the other.  Having a degenerative knee sounds like something that would lead you to have more injures, hence you are injury prone.  You can be injury for a reason.  Injury prone doesn’t just mean you are more likely to have random, unrelated injuries.  It just means you are more likely to get hurt for whatever reason.  Kawhi got a severe injury back in 2017 and it turned out to be a degenerative injury, and from that point forward he became an injury prone player.  A leads to B leads to C.  I don’t see how that wouldn’t count as injury prone.</p>

<p>Prior to that his load management was ankle or thigh / quad related</p>

      <label for="ls3y57k" class="commentText"><p>the caveat here is that, if you *have been* injured, coming back with a minutes restriction and a b2b restriction makes a ton of sense.  Like Jamal Murray in 2023, coming off of a year and a half off due to his ACL tear.  It&rsquo;s not a binary &ldquo;healthy enough to play&rdquo; or &ldquo;injured and sits&rdquo;; there are conditioning and recovery concerns as well, and sometimes a player is in one of those in-between spots where it&rsquo;s good for both them and the team to play but not big minutes and maybe not every game.</p>

<p>Celtics still played their entire starting 5. Played like ass but still appreciated it haha. I expected Celtics to also load manage their stars but they didn’t. Ever since that you guys became my second favorite team. Rooted for you guys once my okc thunder got eliminated.</p>

<p>And to put in perspective, that game was like the Spurs 4th in 5 nights on a roadtrip or something ridiculous like that. It was an FU to the league for shitty scheduling.

<p>then this reddit comment says the term seems to originate with reference to Embiid:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed. Spurs introduced a kind of proto-“load management” before there was a term for it, in the latter part of Duncan’s career. Term itself seems to originate (in the context of NBA) in ‘17 with 76ers resting Embiid.</p>

<p>it helped him though that the team was good enough from like 2012 - 2016 that he didn&rsquo;t have to play a ton. I remember in 2013 and 2014 the big three often sat most of the third and the entire fourth quarter because they&rsquo;d blow out a lot of teams.</p>

<p>One thing that needs to mentioned more is how diluted the games are. The 82 games feel like preseason, with no real jeopardy or importance placed on the outcome (which imo also leads to the need for &ldquo;narratives&rdquo; to keep viewers hooked).</p>

<p>NBA needs to have every game feel important again. It would be better for the sport in the long run.</p>

<p>Mullin played 16 years in the League, so he has some credibility here regarding durability.</p>

<p>The most compelling argument I&rsquo;ve heard for lower durability in recent years is that the level of training earlier in top players&rsquo; development (i.e. AAU) is much higher now, leading to more miles on the body by the time a top player even reaches the NBA.</p>

<p>Mullin played for Don Nelson in Golden State, who were arguably one of the fastest teams in the league in the early 90&rsquo;s (they were as fast pace-wise, if not faster, than today&rsquo;s era).</p>

<p>Despite having a lot of injuries in his career, Mullin also went through a stretch under Nellie of only missing 5 games over 4 seasons, averaging 39 minutes a game over those 4 years.</p>

<p>I think more than specializing, the AAU culture just forces the kids to play too many games without rest in order to stand out. They&rsquo;re putting on more muscle and doing crazier moves than ever, but the joints and ligaments can only absorb so much shock.</p>

<p>Its a balancing act of rest and getting reps in, but at the NBA level, players who are already getting paid millions should be resting during the practice times, not games where people pay to watch them.</p>

Rest does matter. It helps. Although there is less evidence that load management prevents injuries overall than teams seem to believe. At least acute ones.</p>

      <label for="ls8twyr" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;This season, the NFL saw progress in overall injury reduction efforts and improved player availability – with players missing 700 fewer games during the 2023 regular season due to injury than they did one year ago. This meant that between two and three fewer players were absent from each game throughout the 2023 regular season due to injury than the previous year.</p>

<p>The decrease in the injury burden was driven largely by a decline in lower-extremity injuries, including lower-extremity strains, knee injuries and ACL tears.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="ls9264j" class="commentText"><p>People should follow the Lebron blueprint more. Go hard at multiple sports as a kid, peak your athleticism without burning your body out as a teenager. Take PEDs as soon as there’s any hint of athletic decline. Make your conditioning so elite that you can coast all season without redlining and still be productive. Then actually give it your all in the playoffs. Rinse and repeat. If you are not the main guy on offense, you can do this while still going hard on defense. Easy formula</p>

I’m sure Mullin understands what a season takes far better than I ever will but ultimately I think it’s more of a question for professionals. They won’t be perfect, but you’d hope their expertise leads to the right outcome most of the time.</p>
