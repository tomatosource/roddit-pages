      <label for="ls3vhwf" class="commentText"><p>A lot of the injuries nowadays come from the focus on a single sport growing up and the crazy high mileage these kids are putting on themselves as opposed to prior generations when guys were multi sport athletes and there wasn&rsquo;t the crazy travel ball/AAU workloads.</p>

<p>This article on it from 2019 was pretty great:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis" target="_blank">https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis</a></p>

<p>Quote from in the article talking about assessing teens:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t be peaking at 16 or 17,&rdquo; Elliott says later. &ldquo;But I can tell you from a data standpoint, you can make a case for it. And you talk to the individual athletes, a whole lot of them will tell you, &lsquo;Oh, when I was a senior in high school is when I was jumping my best. I was moving my best.&rsquo; A lot of guys will tell that story. It just shouldn&rsquo;t be that way. It should happen at 23, 24, 25, but with most of these kids, that&rsquo;s not the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These kids HAVE to go 110% so young because they need to be “NBA-ready” by like 17 years old to make it.</p>

<p>Since talent goes one-and-done nowadays, instead of the traditional 4 years in college, what time is there to dedicate towards rest and recovery.</p>

<p>Gotta keep training, working out, playing. Gotta push it. Pedal to the metal or else there is no NBA end-goal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it means a shortened athletic prime, and probably a ton of potential talent never realized because of career-ending injuries at early stages.</p>

I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s quite realistic to expect average hoops parents to understand this stuff on a deeper level and have the type of foresight to create a perfect plan, but I do think the resources are at least available to the masses which is a start.</p>

      <label for="ls454rc" class="commentText"><p>Is it possible, though?</p>

<p>The time allocated towards providing proper rest and recovery could be opportunity cost that’s otherwise spent improving and showcasing talent.</p>

<p>My premise is that it’s a shitty tradeoff. Parents may not have the choice of ensuring that these kids are developing for a long term career, because it may jeopardize their ability to play professional ball.</p>

      <label for="ls46ox2" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a player development coach and through some of the research I&rsquo;ve done in terms of training methods and from what I&rsquo;ve witnessed coaching at the youth and HS/prep levels, yes it&rsquo;s very very possible. The grind culture of America is partially the issue and everyone is so brainwashed to really understand that there are better ways.</p>

<p>I dont have any kids, but when I do I&rsquo;m like 100% confident I could get my kid a scholarship. Maybe he&rsquo;s not tall enough to make it to the league or doesn&rsquo;t end up in the luckiest circumstances, (idk just building in argument-safeguards before someone comes in crucifying me lol) but yeah I could definitely take a &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; approach and get him to be a very talented, healthy player.</p>

<p>The information is out there, but ppl are really brainwashed by American culture and the AAU monopoly has induced some very real FOMO effects. They make everyone think their hands are tied and that they just have to throw their kid into the meat grinder to have a chance.</p>

<p>Edit: Typo&rsquo;s +</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all guesswork with everyone involved and their solution is to just grind kids into the dust. That&rsquo;s what upsets me. If the adults were interested in doing more research they would discover much more efficient and enjoyable methods for their kids to be even better players. Cheaper probably too. That&rsquo;s the real issue, youth basketball has become a gigantic money-grab and parents are just throwing money at the problem and not realizing they can get better results for cheaper.</p>

<p>It’s a terrible system but good luck convincing your kid to rest or diversify and fall behind his peers when he has D1/NBA ambitions.</p>

<p>Until then (if that ever happens), the best you&rsquo;ll get is individual cases where a young player has the stars align and has a great support system all the way up to his NBA journey where the parents are smart enough to keep their kid playing multiple sports and stay away from falling for the AAU scams until he&rsquo;s 15-16.</p>

Not necessarily speaking on the guys that are getting hurt in the league now, but yeah that article came out in 2019 and theres other research that&rsquo;s been done in the last decade that&rsquo;s a game changer in terms of player development.</p>

<p>Kids getting roped into this shitty system nowadays is really a byproduct of the adults in their lives not doing their due diligence and it sucks. Parents, coaches, skills trainers, S&amp;C/performance coaches all need to start pulling their weight more and advising these kids better and keeping their bodies safer.</p>

<p>If fans are paying money from their own pockets to see YOU play, you play, this league is nothing without fans.</p>

<p>Honestly part of the reason why players are so injury-prone nowadays is overuse from when they are children onwards. It literally never gets talked about tho but it’s the truth and look no further than Lamelo and Lonzo Ball as an example. Never played any other sports, trained at least 3 hours a day, 365 days a year for a decade straight for only basketball. That fucks up your body once you get to a more physical level. Players growing up in the 70s, 80s and 90s were multi-sport athletes and did not train every damn day of their lives to that extent for one specific sport.</p>

      <label for="ls3ud2k" class="commentText"><p>yeah there&rsquo;s something to that with the kids training younger, overtraining, and doing specialized or single sport training too early</p>

<p>it should be more important for aspiring professionals to play multiple sports / build a strong athletic foundation that doesn&rsquo;t involve the weight room than doing professional level sport specific training</p>

<p>I think this is one of the reasons so many Euro players are gaining an edge on american basketball players, is that they are not getting trapped in the elite training and instead live more natural, fluid athletic lifestyles like also playing futbol, etc</p>

      <label for="ls3yqyc" class="commentText"><p>Funnily enough it was MJ who said that first, that he tried to play every game especially away games because he knew some people would only show up once in their entire lives just to see him, and he felt he had an obligation there.</p>

<p>MJ ultimately played all 82 games eight times during his 13 years with the Bulls.</p>

<p>the other five were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>18 games when he broke his foot his second year (this was famously the same season where he dropped 63 in the Garden in the playoffs)</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 81 games in 88-89</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 80 games in 91-92</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 78 games in 92-93</p></li>

<li><p>17 games in his comeback season after retirement</p></li>

      <label for="ls42ius" class="commentText"><p>I think people (including former players) are underrating how grueling the game is these days.</p>

<p>The explosion of the 3pt shot has resulted in the game having significantly more space, which means you need more explosive movements to create space and close space. Not to mention, the skill threshold increasing means dudes have to do even more these days to succeed (in both a macro and micro sense).</p>

<p>Like, think how much force is generated in current eurosteps or step backs. The ground dudes cover is insane. That only happens because dudes are creating sufficient force to change directions so drastically.</p>

<p>Not to mention non-centers are probably bigger/heavier these days than they used to be, which only compounds the issue (because now they need even MORE force to move themselves).</p>

      <label for="ls48j2w" class="commentText"><p>Ive firmly believed for a number of years that its the number of hard lateral cuts that lead to major soft tissue injuries. Think cross overs and sudden change of direction when guarding someone. With space and pace, there is more of it. It also means more sprints and fatigue which is when you&rsquo;re likely to take bad steps or be off balance in general.</p>

<p>The game for so many years was iso heavy when 4 players basically stood around and moved very little.</p>

Everything is out to the three point line. While Fox and Sabonis run pnr they got Monk, Huerter or Murray coming off screens opposite side. Every big has to move on the perimeter. The closeouts are farther and more desperate. Transition defense is a nightmare. Etc.</p>

      <label for="ls44bfb" class="commentText"><p>Well to be fair here, two of the seasons were shortened 10 games due to COVID and one season he was forced to miss 9 games due to COVID protocols. I don’t really think Embiid is load managing in the sense that the Spurs or LeBron were. Embiid does have a long rap sheet of injuries, some of them are fluky (markelle breaking embiid’s face being one of them)</p>

      <label for="ls3tg3s" class="commentText"><p>according to this reddit comment it was because it was the Spurs 4th game in 5 nights:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And to put in perspective, that game was like the Spurs 4th in 5 nights on a roadtrip or something ridiculous like that. It was an FU to the league for shitty scheduling. (But I also think it was a strategic element before a potential finals rematch: basically not giving Spo a chance to see our full lineup against theirs)</p>

<p>then this reddit comment says the term seems to originate with reference to Embiid:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed. Spurs introduced a kind of proto-“load management” before there was a term for it, in the latter part of Duncan’s career. Term itself seems to originate (in the context of NBA) in ‘17 with 76ers resting Embiid.</p>

<p>it helped him though that the team was good enough from like 2012 - 2016 that he didn&rsquo;t have to play a ton. I remember in 2013 and 2014 the big three often sat most of the third and the entire fourth quarter because they&rsquo;d blow out a lot of teams.</p>

      <label for="ls3y57k" class="commentText"><p>the caveat here is that, if you *have been* injured, coming back with a minutes restriction and a b2b restriction makes a ton of sense.  Like Jamal Murray in 2023, coming off of a year and a half off due to his ACL tear.  It&rsquo;s not a binary &ldquo;healthy enough to play&rdquo; or &ldquo;injured and sits&rdquo;; there are conditioning and recovery concerns as well, and sometimes a player is in one of those in-between spots where it&rsquo;s good for both them and the team to play but not big minutes and maybe not every game.</p>

      <label for="ls3vwab" class="commentText"><p>Number of possessions per game is roughly equivalent to 80s-90s. (Mpg has only been tracked since 2014)</p>

<p>Mullin played 16 years in the League, so he has some credibility here regarding durability.</p>

<p>The most compelling argument I&rsquo;ve heard for lower durability in recent years is that the level of training earlier in top players&rsquo; development (i.e. AAU) is much higher now, leading to more miles on the body by the time a top player even reaches the NBA.</p>

      <label for="ls44xuo" class="commentText"><p>Pace of play does not remotely tell you the whole story though since it doesn&rsquo;t tell you what actually happened during those possessions. Half court offenses used to be slow as shit with guys just standing around while a star player iso&rsquo;d a large amount of the time. Today&rsquo;s half court offenses involve a lot of running even off ball. The pace may be comparable, but the speed and distance are not.</p>
