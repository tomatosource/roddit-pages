      <label for="ls3vhwf" class="commentText"><p>A lot of the injuries nowadays come from the focus on a single sport growing up and the crazy high mileage these kids are putting on themselves as opposed to prior generations when guys were multi sport athletes and there wasn&rsquo;t the crazy travel ball/AAU workloads.</p>

<p>This article on it from 2019 was pretty great:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis" target="_blank">https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27148543/under-knife-exposing-america-youth-basketball-crisis</a></p>

<p>Quote from in the article talking about assessing teens:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t be peaking at 16 or 17,&rdquo; Elliott says later. &ldquo;But I can tell you from a data standpoint, you can make a case for it. And you talk to the individual athletes, a whole lot of them will tell you, &lsquo;Oh, when I was a senior in high school is when I was jumping my best. I was moving my best.&rsquo; A lot of guys will tell that story. It just shouldn&rsquo;t be that way. It should happen at 23, 24, 25, but with most of these kids, that&rsquo;s not the case.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="ls3zdjj" class="commentText"><p>Well if you’re making that point, then I’d argue it’s a systemic issue.</p>

<p>These kids HAVE to go 110% so young because they need to be “NBA-ready” by like 17 years old to make it.</p>

<p>Since talent goes one-and-done nowadays, instead of the traditional 4 years in college, what time is there to dedicate towards rest and recovery.</p>

<p>Gotta keep training, working out, playing. Gotta push it. Pedal to the metal or else there is no NBA end-goal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it means a shortened athletic prime, and probably a ton of potential talent never realized because of career-ending injuries at early stages.</p>

<p>If fans are paying money from their own pockets to see YOU play, you play, this league is nothing without fans.</p>

<p>Honestly part of the reason why players are so injury-prone nowadays is overuse from when they are children onwards. It literally never gets talked about tho but it’s the truth and look no further than Lamelo and Lonzo Ball as an example. Never played any other sports, trained at least 3 hours a day, 365 days a year for a decade straight for only basketball. That fucks up your body once you get to a more physical level. Players growing up in the 70s, 80s and 90s were multi-sport athletes and did not train every damn day of their lives to that extent for one specific sport.</p>

      <label for="ls3ud2k" class="commentText"><p>yeah there&rsquo;s something to that with the kids training younger, overtraining, and doing specialized or single sport training too early</p>

<p>it should be more important for aspiring professionals to play multiple sports / build a strong athletic foundation that doesn&rsquo;t involve the weight room than doing professional level sport specific training</p>

<p>I think this is one of the reasons so many Euro players are gaining an edge on american basketball players, is that they are not getting trapped in the elite training and instead live more natural, fluid athletic lifestyles like also playing futbol, etc</p>

<p>MJ ultimately played all 82 games eight times during his 13 years with the Bulls.</p>

<p>the other five were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>18 games when he broke his foot his second year (this was famously the same season where he dropped 63 in the Garden in the playoffs)</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 81 games in 88-89</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 80 games in 91-92</p></li>

<li><p>a measly 78 games in 92-93</p></li>

Players are better today, but what you are claiming would imply players are trying harder&hellip;exerting themselves more than they used to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to imagine players exerting more effort than Barkley or Rodman, KG or Jordan. Do you think people back in the day just weren&rsquo;t trying? Lol</p>

      <label for="ls3tg3s" class="commentText"><p>according to this reddit comment it was because it was the Spurs 4th game in 5 nights:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And to put in perspective, that game was like the Spurs 4th in 5 nights on a roadtrip or something ridiculous like that. It was an FU to the league for shitty scheduling. (But I also think it was a strategic element before a potential finals rematch: basically not giving Spo a chance to see our full lineup against theirs)</p>

<p>then this reddit comment says the term seems to originate with reference to Embiid:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed. Spurs introduced a kind of proto-“load management” before there was a term for it, in the latter part of Duncan’s career. Term itself seems to originate (in the context of NBA) in ‘17 with 76ers resting Embiid.</p>

<p>Joel Embiid has never played more than 68 games in a season. Embiid average 54 games per season, if you include the first two years that he sat out, he averaged 43 games per season.</p>

<p>it helped him though that the team was good enough from like 2012 - 2016 that he didn&rsquo;t have to play a ton. I remember in 2013 and 2014 the big three often sat most of the third and the entire fourth quarter because they&rsquo;d blow out a lot of teams.</p>

      <label for="ls3y57k" class="commentText"><p>the caveat here is that, if you *have been* injured, coming back with a minutes restriction and a b2b restriction makes a ton of sense.  Like Jamal Murray in 2023, coming off of a year and a half off due to his ACL tear.  It&rsquo;s not a binary &ldquo;healthy enough to play&rdquo; or &ldquo;injured and sits&rdquo;; there are conditioning and recovery concerns as well, and sometimes a player is in one of those in-between spots where it&rsquo;s good for both them and the team to play but not big minutes and maybe not every game.</p>

<p>Mullin played 16 years in the League, so he has some credibility here regarding durability.</p>

<p>The most compelling argument I&rsquo;ve heard for lower durability in recent years is that the level of training earlier in top players&rsquo; development (i.e. AAU) is much higher now, leading to more miles on the body by the time a top player even reaches the NBA.</p>

      <label for="ls42ius" class="commentText"><p>I think people (including former players) are underrating how grueling the game is these days.</p>

<p>The explosion of the 3pt shot has resulted in the game having significantly more space, which means you need more explosive movements to create space and close space. Not to mention, the skill threshold increasing means dudes have to do even more these days to succeed (in both a macro and micro sense).</p>

<p>Like, think how much force is generated in current eurosteps or step backs. The ground dudes cover is insane. That only happens because dudes are creating sufficient force to change directions so drastically.</p>

<p>Not to mention non-centers are probably bigger/heavier these days than they used to be, which only compounds the issue (because now they need even MORE force to move themselves).</p>
